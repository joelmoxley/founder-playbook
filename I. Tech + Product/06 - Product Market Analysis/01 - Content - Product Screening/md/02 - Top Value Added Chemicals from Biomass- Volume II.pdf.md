This is the second part of a 2-part DOE series on screening products and narrowing down a select target number of chemical candidates. The first part focused on candidates from sugar and synthesis gas, and this part focuses on candidates from lignin. This resource can give you a sense of the comprehensiveness necessary to comfortably dedicate company resources towards chemical product development.

Executive Summary
This report evaluates lignin’s role as a renewable raw material resource.
Opportunities that arise from utilizing lignin fit into three categories:
• power, fuel and syngas (generally near-term opportunities)
• macromolecules (generally medium-term opportunities)
• aromatics and miscellaneous monomers (long-term opportunities)
Biorefineries will receive and process massive amounts of lignin. For this
reason, how lignin can be best used to support the economic health of the
biorefinery must be defined. An approach that only considers process heat
would be shortsighted. Higher value products present economic opportunities
and the potential to significantly increase the amount of liquid transportation
fuel available from biomass.
In this analysis a list of potential uses of lignin was compiled and sorted into
“product types” which are broad classifications (listed above as power—fuel—
syngas; macromolecules; and aromatics).
In the first “product type” (power—fuel—gasification) lignin is used purely as
a carbon source and aggressive means are employed to break down its
polymeric structure. In the second “product type” (macromolecules) the
opposite extreme is considered and advantage of the macromolecular
structure imparted by nature is retained in high-molecular weight
applications. The third “product type” (aromatics) lies somewhere between
the two extremes and employs technologies that would break up lignin’s
macromolecular structure but maintain the aromatic nature of the building
block molecules.
The individual opportunities were evaluated based on their technical
difficulty, market, market risk, building block utility, and whether a pure
material or a mixture would be produced. Unlike Volume I of this report, “Top
Value Added Chemicals from Biomass, Volume I: Results of Screening for
Potential Candidate from Sugars and Synthesis Gas” (commonly called the
Sugars Top 10 Report), it was difficult to identify the ten best opportunities,
however, the potential opportunities fell nicely into near-, medium- and longterm
opportunities. Furthermore, the near-, medium- and long-term
opportunities roughly align with the three “product types.” From this analysis
a list of technical barriers was developed which can be used to identify
research needs.
Lignin presents many challenges for use in the biorefinery. Chemically it
differs from sugars by having a complex aromatic substructure. Unlike
cellulose, which has a relatively simple substructure of glucose subunits,
lignin has a high degree of variability in its structure which differs according
1
to the biomass source and the recovery process used. In addition to its
structural variability lignin is also reactive and to some degree less stable
thermally and oxidatively compared with other biomass streams. What this
means is that integrating a lignin process stream within the biorefinery will
require identifying the best method to cost-effectively separate lignin from
biomass.
Moving forward we offer seven points of consideration:

(1) Lignin offers impact. Since lignin constitutes up to 30% of the weight and
40% of the fuel value of biomass it can be used to increase fuel production.
It offers higher revenues to biorefineries through production of products
rather than power. However, the technology needs to be developed to realize
lignin’s potential.
(2) There is a balanced R&D portfolio of near- medium- and long-term
opportunities, each with their own technical challenges.
(3) Some technology is available for lignin use now. Thermochemical
processes can be used with many lignin streams in the near to medium term.
Also some of the macromolecular opportunities, identified as medium-term,
exist today.
(4) The most effective use of DOE funds will be in broadly applicable
technology development. Medium- and long-term opportunities will require
transcending some significant barriers.
(5) Development of selective and robust catalytic processes to selectively
break and make bonds will be an important area of technology development.
(6) In addition, other technical support is also required and at least as
important. This includes lignin conditioning, structure analysis and
separations technology.
(7) Perhaps the most important point is this: technoeconomic analysis is
required to determine the value proposition of lignin utilization beyond power
and should be a driving force to guide research efforts in this day of limited
budgets. This will allow us to uncover opportunities in the shortest time.
