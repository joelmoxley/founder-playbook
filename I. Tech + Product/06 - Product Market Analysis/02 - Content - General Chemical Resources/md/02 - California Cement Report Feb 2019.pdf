The cement industry accounts for more than 5 percent of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The cleanest cement factories can emit as little as half the pollution as their dirtiest counterparts. The findings of this report show that California’s cement industry is not yet a part of the transition to a low-carbon cement and concrete sector. The state’s cement factories are the largest consumers of coal and petroleum coke in California; in fact, California’s cement factories have higher emissions per ton of cement than similar factories in China, India, and other major cement-producing regions.
