In this modern age of industrial competition, a successful chemical engineer
needs more than a knowledge and understanding of the fundamental sciences
and the related engineering subjects such as thermodynamics, reaction kinetics,
and computer technology. The engineer must also have the ability to apply this
knowledge to practical situations for the purpose of accomplishing something
that will be beneficial to society. However, in making these applications, the
chemical engineer must recognize the economic implications which are involved
and proceed accordingly.
Chemical engineering design of new chemical plants and the expansion or
revision of existing ones require the use of engineering principles and theories
combined with a practical realization of the limits imposed by industrial conditions.
Development of a new plant or process from concept evaluation to
profitable reality is often an enormously complex problem. A plant-design
project moves to completion through a series of stages such as is shown in the
following:
1. Inception
2. Preliminary evaluation of economics and market
3. Development of data necessary for final design
4. Final economic evaluation
5. Detailed engineering design
6. Procurement
7. Erection
8. Startup and trial runs

2 PLANT DESIGN AND ECONOMICS FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
This brief outline suggests that the plant-design project involves a wide variety
of skills. Among these are research, market analysis, design of individual pieces
of equipment, cost estimation, computer programming, and plant-location surveys.
In fact, the services of a chemical engineer are needed in each step of the
outline, either in a central creative role, or as a key advisor.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING PLANT DESIGN
As used in this text, the general term plant design includes all engineering
aspects involved in the development of either a new, modified, or expanded
industrial plant. In this development, the chemical engineer will be making
economic evaluations of new processes, designing individual pieces of equipment
for the proposed new venture, or developing a plant layout for coordination
of the overall operation. Because of these many design duties, the chemical
engineer is many times referred to here as a design engineer. On the other hand,
a chemical engineer specializing in the economic aspects of the design is often
referred to as a cost engineer. In many instances, the term process engineering is
used in connection with economic evaluation and general economic analyses of
industrial processes, while process design refers to the actual design of the
equipment and facilities necessary for carrying out the process. Similarly, the
meaning of plant design is limited by some engineers to items related directly to
the complete plant, such as plant layout, general service facilities, and plant
location.
The purpose of this book is to present the major aspects of plant design as
related to the overall design project. Although one person cannot be an expert
in all the phases involved in plant design, it is necessary to be acquainted with
the general problems and approach in each of the phases. The process engineer
may not be connected directly with the final detailed design of the equipment,
and the designer of the equipment may have little influence on a decision by
management as to whether or not a given return on an investment is adequate
to justify construction of a complete plant. Nevertheless, if the overall design
project is to be successful, close teamwork is necessary among the various
groups of engineers working on the different phases of the project. The most
effective teamwork and coordination of efforts are obtained when each of the
engineers in the specialized groups is aware of the many functions in the overall
design project.
PROCESS DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
The development of a process design, as outlined in Chap. 2, involves many
different steps. The first, of course, must be the inception of the basic idea. This
idea may originate in the sales department, as a result of a customer request, or
to meet a competing product. It may occur spontaneously to someone who is
acquainted with the aims and needs of a particular compaqy, 8r it may be the , . _
/
INTRODUCI-ION 3
result of an orderly research program or an offshoot of such a program. The
operating division of the company may develop a new or modified chemical,
generally as an intermediate in the final product. The engineering department
of the company may originate a new process or modify an existing process to
create new products. In all these possibilities, if the initial analysis indicates that
the idea may have possibilities of developing into a worthwhile project, a
preliminary research or investigation program is initiated. Here, a general
survey of the possibilities for a successful process is made considering the
physical and chemical operations involved as well as the economic aspects. Next
comes the process-research phase including preliminary market surveys, laboratory-scale
experiments, and production of research samples of the final product.
When the potentialities of the process are fairly well established, the project is
ready for the development phase. At this point, a pilot plant or a commercialdevelopment
plant may be constructed. A pilot plant is a small-scale replica of
the full-scale final plant, while a commercial-development plant is usually made
from odd pieces of equipment which are already available and is not meant to
duplicate the exact setup to be used in the full-scale plant.
Design data and other process information are obtained during the
development stage. This information is used as the basis for carrying out the
additional phases of the design project. A complete market analysis is made,
and samples of the final product are sent to prospective customers to determine
if the product is satisfactory and if there is a reasonable sales potential.
Capital-cost estimates for the proposed plant are made. Probable returns on the
required investment are determined, and a complete cost-and-profit analysis of
the process is developed.
Before the final process design starts, company management normally
becomes involved to decide if significant capital funds will be committed to the
project. It is at this point that the engineers’ preliminary design work along with
the oral and written reports which are presented become particularly important
because they will provide the primary basis on which management will decide if
further funds should be provided for the project. When management has made
a firm decision to proceed with provision of significant capital funds for a
project, the engineering then involved in further work on the project is known
as capitalized engineering while that which has gone on before while the
consideration of the project was in the development stage is often referred to as
expensed engineering. This distinction is used for tax purposes to allow capitalized
engineering costs to be amortized over a period of several years.
If the economic picture is still satisfactory, the final process-design phase
is ready to begin. All the design details are worked out in this phase including
controls, services; piping layouts, firm price quotations, specifications and designs
for individual pieces of equipment, and all the other design information
necessary for the construction of the final plant. A complete construction design
is then made with elevation drawings, plant-layout arrangements, and other
information required for the actual construction of the plant. The final stage * _
I

consists of procurement of the equipment, construction of the plant, startup of
the plant, overall improvements in the operation, and development of standard
operating procedures to give the best possible results.
The development of a design project proceeds in a logical, organized
sequence requiring more and more time, effort, and expenditure as one phase
leads into the next. It is extremely important, therefore, to stop and analyze the
situation carefully before proceeding with each subsequent phase. Many projects
are discarded as soon as the preliminary investigation or research on the
original idea is completed. The engineer working on the project must maintain a
realistic and practical attitude in advancing through the various stages of a
design project and not be swayed by personal interests and desires when
deciding if further work on a particular project is justifiable. Remember, if the
engineer’s work is continued on through the various phases of a design project,
it will eventually end up in a proposal that money be invested in the process. If
no tangible return can be realized from the investment, the proposal will be
turned down. Therefore, the engineer should have the ability to eliminate
unprofitable ventures before the design project approaches a final-proposal
stage.
GENERAL OVERALL DESIGN
CONSIDERATIONS
The development of the overall design project involves many different design
considerations. Failure to include these considerations in the overall design
project may, in many instances, alter the entire economic situation so drastically
as to make the venture unprofitable. Some of the factors involved in the
development of a complete plant design include plant location, plant layout,
materials of construction, structural design, utilities, buildings, storage, materials
handling, safety, waste disposal, federal, state, and local laws or codes, and
patents. Because of their importance, these general overall design considerations
are considered in detail in Chap. 3.
Various types of computer programs and techniques are used to carry out
the design of individual pieces of equipment or to develop the strategy for a full
plant design. This application of computer usage in design is designated as
computer-aided design and is the subject of Chap. 4.
Record keeping and accounting procedures are also important factors in
general design considerations, and it is necessary that the design engineer be
familiar with the general terminology and approach used by accountants for cost
and asset accounting. This subject is covered in Chap. 5.
COST ESTIMATION
As soon as the final process-design stage is completed, it, becomes possible to
make accurate cost estimations because detailed equipmept specifications and
definite plant-facility information are available. Direct price quotations based-
INTRODUCTION 5
on detailed specifications can then be obtained from various manufacturers.
However, as mentioned earlier, no design project should proceed to the final
stages before costs are considered, and cost estimates should be made throughout
all the early stages of the design when complete specifications are not
available. Evaluation of costs in the preliminary design phases is sometimes
called “guesstimation” but the appropriate designation is predesign cost estimation.
Such estimates should be capable of providing a basis for company
management to decide if further capital should be invested in the project.
The chemical engineer (or cost engineer) must be certain to consider all
possible factors when making a cost analysis. Fixed costs, direct production costs
for raw materials, labor, maintenance, power, and utilities must all be included
along with costs for plant and administrative overhead, distribution of the final
products, and other miscellaneous items.
Chapter 6 presents many of the special techniques that have been developed
for making predesign cost estimations. Labor and material indexes,
standard cost ratios, and special multiplication factors are examples of information
used when making design estimates of costs. The final test as to the validity
of any cost estimation can come only when the completed plant has been put
into operation. However, if the design engineer is well acquainted with the
various estimation methods and their accuracy, it is possible to make remarkably
close cost estimations even before the final process design gives detailed
specifications.
FACTORS AFFECTING PROFITABILITY
OF INVESTMENTS
A major function of the directors of a manufacturing firm is to maximize the
long-term profit to the owners or the stockholders. A decision to invest in fixed
facilities carries with it the burden of continuing interest, insurance, taxes,
depreciation, manufacturing costs, etc., and also reduces the fluidity of the
company’s future actions. Capital-investment decisions, therefore, must be
made with great care. Chapters 7 and 10 present guidelines for making these
capital-investment decisions.
Money, or any other negotiable type of capital, has a time value. When a
manufacturing enterprise invests money, it expects to receive a return during
the time the money is being used. The amount of return demanded usually
depends on the degree of risk that is assumed. Risks differ between projects
which might otherwise seem equal on the basis of the best estimates of an
overall plant design. The risk may depend upon the process used, whether it is
well established or a complete innovation; on the product to be made, whether
it is a stapie item or a completely new product; on the sales forecasts, whether
all sales will be outside the company or whether a significant fraction is internal,
etc. Since means for incorporating different levels of risk into profitability
forecasts are not too well established, the most common methods are to raise
the minimum acceptable rate of return for the riskier projects.
6 PLANT DESIGN AND ECONOMICS FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
Time value of money has been integrated into investment-evaluation
systems by means of compound-interest relationships. Dollars, at different times,
are given different degrees of importance by means of compounding or discounting
at some preselected compound-interest rate. For any assumed interest
value of money, a known amount at any one time can be converted to an
equivalent but different amount at a different time. As time passes, money can
be invested to increase at the interest rate. If the time when money is needed
for investment is in the future, the present value of that investment can be
calculated by discounting from the time of investment back to the present at the
assumed interest rate.
Expenses, as outlined in Chap. 8, for various types of taxes and insurance
can materially affect the economic situation for any industrial process. Because
modern taxes may amount to a major portion of a manufacturing firm’s net
earnings, it is essential that the chemical engineer be conversant with the
fundamentals of taxation. For example, income taxes apply differently to projects
with different proportions of fixed and working capital. Profitability,
therefore, should be based on income after taxes. Insurance costs, on the other
hand, are normally only a small part of the total operational expenditure of an
industrial enterprise; however, before any operation can be carried out on a
sound economic basis, it is necessary to determine the insurance requirements
to provide adequate coverage against unpredictable emergencies or developments.
Since all physical assets of an industrial facility decrease in value with age,
it is normal practice to make periodic charges against earnings so as to
distribute the first cost of the facility over its expected service life. This
depreciation expense as detailed in Chap. 9, unlike most other expenses, entails
no current outlay of cash. Thus, in a given accounting period, a firm has
available, in addition to the net profit, additional funds corresponding to the
depreciation expense. This cash is capital recovery, a partial regeneration of the
first cost of the physical assets.
Income-tax laws permit recovery of funds by two accelerated depreciation
schedules as well as by straight-line methods. Since cash-flow timing is affected,
choice of depreciation method affects profitability significantly. Depending on
the ratio of depreciable to nondepreciable assets involved, two projects which
look equivalent before taxes, or rank in one order, may rank entirely differently
when considered after taxes. Though cash costs and sales values may be equal
on two projects, their reported net incomes for tax purposes may be different,
and one will show a greater net profit than the other.
OPTIMUM DESIGN
In almost every case encountered by a chemical engineer, there are several
alternative methods which can be used for any given process or operation. For
example, formaldehyde can be produced by catalytic dehydrogenation of t
INTRODUmION 7
methanol, by controlled oxidation of natural gas, or by direct reaction between
CO and H, under special conditions of catalyst, temperature, and pressure.
Each of these processes contains many possible alternatives involving variables
such as gas-mixture composition, temperature, pressure, and choice of catalyst.
It is the responsibility of the chemical engineer, in this case, to choose the best
process and to incorporate into the design the equipment and methods which
will give the best results. To meet this need, various aspects of chemical
engineering plant-design optimization are described in Chap. 11 including
presentation of design strategies which can be used to establish the desired
results in the most efficient manner.
Optimum Economic Design
If there are two or more methods for obtaining exactly equivalent final results,
the preferred method would be the one involving the least total cost. This is the
basis of an optimum economic design. One typical example of an optimum
economic design is determining the pipe diameter to use when pumping a given
amount of fluid from one point to another. Here the same final result (i.e., a set
amount of fluid pumped between two given points) can be accomplished by
using an infinite number of different pipe diameters. However, an economic
balance will show that one particular pipe diameter gives the least total cost.
The total cost includes the cost for pumping the liquid and the cost (i.e., fixed
charges) for the installed piping system.
A graphical representation showing the meaning of an optimum economic
pipe diameter is presented in Fig. l-l. As shown in this figure, the pumping cost
increases with decreased size of pipe diameter because of frictional effects,
while the fixed charges for the pipeline become lower when smaller pipe
diameters are used because of the reduced capital investment. The optimum
economic diameter is located where the sum of the pumping costs and fixed
costs for the pipeline becomes a minimum, since this represents the point of
least total cost. In Fig. l-l, this point is represented by E.
The chemical engineer often selects a final design on the basis of conditions
giving the least total cost. In many cases, however, alternative designs do
not give final products or results that are exactly equivalent. It then becomes
necessary to consider the quality of the product or the operation as well as the
total cost. When the engineer speaks of an optimum economic design, it
ordinarily means the cheapest one selected from a number of equivalent
designs. Cost data, to assist in making these decisions, are presented in Chaps.
14 through 16.
Various types of optimum economic requirements may be encountered in
design work. For example, it may be desirable to choose a design which gives
the maximum profit per unit of time or the minimum total cost per unit of
production. , 1

Optimum Operation Design
Many processes require definite conditions of temperature, pressure, contact
time, or other variables if the best results are to be obtained. It is often possible
to make a partial separation of these optimum conditions from direct economic
considerations. In cases of this type, the best design is designated as the
optimum operation design. The chemical engineer should remember, however,
that economic considerations ultimately determine most quantitative decisions.
Thus, the optimum operation design is usually merely a tool or step in the
development of an optimum economic design.
An excellent example of an optimum operation design is the determination
of operating conditions for the catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur
trioxide. Suppose that all the variables, such as converter size, gas rate, catalyst
activity, and entering-gas concentration, are tied and the only possible variable
is the temperature at which the oxidation occurs. If the temperature is too high,
the yield of SO, will be low because the equilibrium between SO,, SO,, and 0,
is shifted in the direction of SO, and 0,. On the other hand, if the temperature
is too low, the yield will be poor because the reaction rate between SO, and 0,
will be low. Thus, there must be one temperature where She amount of sulfur
trioxide formed will be a maximum. This particular temperature would give the -

optimum operation design. Figure 1-2 presents a graphical method for determining
the optimum operation temperature for the sulfur dioxide converter in
this example. Line AB represents the maximum yields obtainable when the
reaction rate is controlling, while line CD indicates the maximum yields on the
basis of equilibrium conditions controlling. Point 0 represents the optimum
operation temperature where the maximum yield is obtained.
The preceding example is a simplified case of what an engineer might
encounter in a design. In reality, it would usually be necessary to consider
various converter sizes and operation with a series of different temperatures in
order to arrive at the optimum operation design. Under these conditions,
several equivalent designs would apply, and the final decision would be based
on the optimum economic conditions for the equivalent designs.
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGN
The chemical engineer must never lose sight of the practical limitations involved
in a design. It may be possible to determine an exact pipe diameter for an
optimum economic design, but this does not mean that this exact size must be
used in the final design. Suppose the optimum diameter were,3.43 in. (8..71 cm).
It would be impractical to have a special pipe fabricated with an inside diameter
1 0 PLANT DESIGN AND ECONOMICS FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
of 3.43 in. Instead, the engineer would choose a standard pipe size which could
be purchased at regular market prices. In this case, the recommended pipe size
would probably be a standard 3$in.-diameter pipe having an inside diameter of
3.55 in. (9.02 cm).
If the engineer happened to be very conscientious about getting an
adequate return on all investments, he or she might say, “A standard 3-in.-
diameter pipe would require less investment and would probably only increase
the total cost slightly; therefore, I think we should compare the costs with a 3-in.
pipe to the costs with the 3$-in. pipe before making a final decision.” Theoretically,
the conscientious engineer is correct in this case. Suppose the total cost of
the installed 3$in. pipe is $5000 and the total cost of the installed 3-in. pipe is
$4500. If the total yearly savings on power and fixed charges, using the 3$-in.
pipe instead of the 3-in. pipe, were $25, the yearly percent return on the extra
$500 investment would be only 5 percent. Since it should be possible to invest
the extra $500 elsewhere to give more than a 5 percent return, it would appear
that the 3-in.-diameter pipe would be preferred over the 3$in.-diameter pipe.
The logic presented in the preceding example is perfectly sound. It is a
typical example of investment comparison and should be understood by all
chemical engineers. Even though the optimum economic diameter was 3.43 in.,
the good engineer knows that this diameter is only an exact mathematical
number and may vary from month to month as prices or operating conditions
change. Therefore, all one expects to obtain from this particular optimum
economic calculation is a good estimation as to the best diameter, and investment
comparisons may not be necessary.
The practical engineer understands the physical problems which are
involved in the final operation and maintenance of the designed equipment. In
developing the plant layout, crucial control valves must be placed where they
are easily accessible to the operators. Sufficient space must be available for
maintenance personnel to check, take apart, and repair equipment. The engineer
should realize that cleaning operations are simplified if a scale-forming
fluid is passed through the inside of the tubes rather than on the shell side of a
tube-and-shell heat exchanger. Obviously, then, sufficient plant-layout space
should be made available so that the maintenance workers can remove the head
of the installed exchanger and force cleaning worms or brushes through the
inside of the tubes or remove the entire tube bundle when necessary.
The theoretical design of a distillation unit may indicate that the feed
should be introduced on one particular tray in the tower. Instead of specifying a
tower with only one feed inlet on the calculated tray, the practical engineer will
include inlets on several trays above and below the calculated feed point since
the actual operating conditions for the tower will vary and the assumptions
included in the calculations make it impossible to guarantee absolute accuracy.
The preceding examples typify the type of practical problems the chemical
engineer encounters. In design work, theoretical and economic principles must
be combined with an understanding of the common practical problems that will
v
INTRODUCTION 11
arise when the process finally comes to life in the form of a complete plant or a
complete unit.
THE DESIGN APPROACH
The chemical engineer has many tools to choose from in the development of a
profitable plant design. None, when properly utilized, will probably contribute
as much to the optimization of the design as the use of high-speed computers.
Many problems encountered in the process development and design can be
solved rapidly with a higher degree of completeness with high-speed computers
and at less cost than with ordinary hand or desk calculators. Generally overdesign
and safety factors can be reduced with a substantial savings in capital
investment.
At no time, however, should the engineer be led to believe that plants are
designed around computers. They are used to determine design data and are
used as models for optimization once a design is established. They are also used
to maintain operating plants on the desired operating conditions. The latter
function is a part of design and supplements and follows process design.
The general approach in any plant design involves a carefully balanced
combination of theory, practice, originality, and plain common sense. In original
design work, the engineer must deal with many different types of experimental
and empirical data. The engineer may be able to obtain accurate values of heat
capacity, density, vapor-liquid equilibrium data, or other information on physical
properties from the literature. In many cases, however, exact values for
necessary physical properties are not available, and the engineer is forced to
make approximate estimates of these values. Many approximations also must be
made in carrying out theoretical design calculations. For example, even though
the engineer knows that the ideal-gas law applies exactly only to simple gases at
very low pressures, this law is used in many of the calculations when the gas
pressure is as high as 5 or more atmospheres (507 kPa). With common gases,
such as air or simple hydrocarbons, the error introduced by using the ideal gas
law at ordinary pressures and temperatures is usually negligible in comparison
with other uncertainties involved in design calculations. The engineer prefers to
accept this error rather than to spend time determining virial coefficients or
other factors to correct for ideal gas deviations.
In the engineer’s approach to any design problem, it is necessary to be
prepared to make many assumptions. Sometimes these assumptions are made
because no absolutely accurate values or methods of calculation are available.
At other times, methods involving close approximations are used because exact
treatments would require long and laborious calculations giving little gain in
accuracy. The good chemical engineer recognizes the need for making certain
assumptions but also knows that this type of approach introduces some uncertainties
into the final results. Therefore, assumptions are made only when they
are necessary and essentially correct. I ‘
12 PLANT DESIGN AND ECONOMICS FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
Another important factor in the approach to any design problem involves
economic conditions and limitations. The engineer must consider costs and
probable profits constantly throughout all the work. It is almost always better to
sell many units of a product at a low profit per unit than a few units at a high
profit per unit. Consequently, the engineer must take into account the volume
of production when determining costs and total profits for various types of
designs. This obviously leads to considerations of customer needs and demands.
These factors may appear to be distantly removed from the development of a
plant design, but they are extremely important in determining its ultimate
success.
