ARPA-E University: Tech Transfer & IP - Lessons Learned from an Academic Entrepreneur

great well thank you everyone for joining us today Josh schooled from RB and we've got what looks to be a very exciting hour ahead of us as most of you on the webinar probably know our p.e wants to fund the best ideas for technology to transform the way we generate store and utilize interview and so not surprisingly a lot of these great ideas come out of universities so we've got a guest on the webinar today who is very well positioned to speak to the experience of developing a technology while at a university specifically professor Leland is well-positioned to spare to share his experience of going through the many steps from from IP to technology transfer to dealing with the  private sector and its many shapes and forms to see that his idea made it out into the world and so in just a second I'm going to turn it over to Leland who  will tell us about his experience but before we do that I just want our audience to know that the majority of this session is about addressing your questions and comments that's the whole reason we chose this topic we chose this harp topic because we at RBE spend a good chunk of our time here and with academic institutions and folks at those institutions who are trying to accomplish similar objectives to what Lee has done and therefore many of you are encountering similar challenges and so that's why we really strongly encourage you to add your own questions you should see a bar and a webinar to add your your questions please do that at any time we're looking at them reviewing them and we will tee up as many of those as possible for Lee to address and a webinar and a final half housekeeping note is that a recording of today's webinar and a copy of the slides will be available within about a week on the rpe website so everyone who's registered and he's on the webinar today should see email later today with the appropriate link and so baller okay so before we we kick off Lee has a brief introduction and presentation to tell you a bit more about his how about himself and his experience so without any further ado and assuming our webinar technology here is working I'll hand it over to Lee okay good afternoon everyone except i guess those on the west coast it's still good morning so it's my leasure to be with you and consistent with what Josh just said I'm going to scrap / some initial things up but my thought is that most of the value for you folks will come in discussion so let's let's proceed I'm going to introduce myself a little bit just so you understand my experience and motivations talk a little bit about a company i co-founded talk about my experience with technology transfer and IP and add a couple of other perspectives and then we'll go into the QA so when I say here that my career is oriented along an axis of ends rather than means you know I'm trained in biology and engineering but at a certain point I'm  years old with a certain point you sort of become what you do not what you were trained as only and I've oriented my career around producing transportation fuels from plants you can't eat and that's really the end and at various times and sort of cumulative way have picked tools off the shelf that seem relevant to what I perceive to be some of the big problems and opportunities in that area so we literally do some aspects of molecular biology and I daresay even our leaders and a few defined frontiers in molecular biology we do quite a bit of engineering this is my academic research group now I'm speaking of and also do a global resource assessment and so those don't have any disciplinary coherence but they do have a flick applied coherence perhaps an unusual way to organize things in any case that's what it feels like I'm doing singularly focused on cellulosic biofuels since I did my undergraduate thesis in 1979 I just mentioned sort of the diversity of areas and pretty much this is what I do and when the world is ready to move I'm ready to talk and if not I keep working on it has been my strategy or it's been what I've done not all of this was thought out but you just keep paddling and eventually hopefully you get across the river and so wyd might I start a company or really why do I you know work hard I want to be a service in the context of the sustainable resource revolution we had a Neolithic Revolution where humanity went from primarily hunting and gathering to a farming existence or pastoral and then from a pre-industrial pastoral existence to a post-industrial or at least industrial but pre sustainable state so we've had two of these revolutions thus far in resource terms and we kind of need to be in the midst of the third one although their signs are mixed anyway that's what I want to impact given given that desire it was a fairly obvious thing to start a company and in fact I tried to do so in 91 2 95 the timing was not good and then the opportunity somewhat came to me in 2007 we could talk about that if it's a more interest excuse me 05 my mistake and mask over was founded in 06 so it's not like I suddenly got interested I've been interested a long time when the world sort of came around to me okay so timing is critically important ously and want to spend too much time saying the obvious but as I just mentioned my direct experience was you know an idea at the right time the world's much more receptive than something they're not thinking about yet there were a number of factors that led to the do ability of a cellulosic biofuel start up in the 05-06 time frame and so this is from Moscow most site Tim one thing I found in my early efforts in the 94 and 95 time frames or 91 295 timeframe to start a company was I I would go before VCS and I since they would do this calculation which is you know what he's kind of he's not leaving his day job as an academic he's not mortgaging his house he's kind of asking me to be more at risk than he is and I sense a distinct distaste for that I think investors like to see that the the entrepreneur the founder is all in and heavily invested if not heavily at risk and that was a factor early on and that can be a bar for an academic to establish that you know you're putting your I'm asking you to put in 5 10  million dollars but believe me I've got as much in this as you do they don't want to invest in something that that they think you might walk in interestingly the second time around I think partly because I devoted  years to the field that was not a question I think people kind of felt well okay this guy's obviously back huh he's obviously just get skin in the game it's called life work so it's just interesting to see how that played out and we could talk about that more if you like so there were three founders I think Bob Johnson's name spelled with an e by the way but that's my error because I made up these slides but Charlotte Charlie Lyman and Bob Johnson them again we could talk about the story if you like the initial exclusive focus with cellulosic ethanol be a consolidated by a processing total venture investment exclusive of governmental investment is a bit about 1 million dollars and I didn't take my think by the way it would take that much money to I thought we'd get so much further than we got with less money than that but in any case initially we had investment from khosla ventures and also flagship today mascoma employs about 75 employees and we have introduced the first yeast into the fuel ethanol industry of any kind happens to be the corn ethanol industry initially we had a build own and operate business model but pivoted to being a check knology provider to the renewable fuel industry again we can talk about all of this but basically it's not an easy thing to both create an industry and create the technology for the industry that is create the commercial industry and also provide it with technology when Mascoma started neither existed but gradually at least the cellulosic industry has emerged and that's enabled mascoma to focus on what we have the deepest experience in which is is providing technology now this is been a case that this field the climate for advanced biofuels which is one way to refer to the sandbox we playin has changed quite a bit the pendulum has swung overall I would say from when masc was founded till now in broadly speaking it's it's I think swung from positive to negative course it's not that simple and there are signs that that pendulum pendulum seldom stay still and I doubt it's going to stay stuck where it is but believe me the well you will notice that any venture is very much a ship on the tide of the perceives potential of their area and that was a very favorable tired tied for a while that's actually a pretty challenging tide right now so circumstances opportunities and companies change and in fact the corporate environment is often more dynamic changes faster than the academic environment although that contains pretty fast too but my sense is a lot of academics sort of plan their trajectories on the one hand grant by grant to be sure but often succeed in guiding a course that the changes might come in periods of decades man from quarter to quarter at times things change pretty dramatically in company and specially startup companies in my experience so as far as IP and that's just a little background about about the experiences that have molded myperspectives but focusing in on tech transfer and IP there is as far as I know a somewhat unusual agreement and one that in many ways in fact most ways I recommend for consideration there's other ways to do it but an unusual IP agreement between Dartmouth and mascoma darkness received equity no royalties and in addition yes that's right from mass coma and mass como received rights not only to what I knew at that time but to other inventions my lab comes up with in the field without new royalty negotiations and the like my sense of Darkness assessment and I'm representing somebody else here because I don't speak for Dartmouth is didn't retrospect I think they feel they would have preferred to have had some royalties as well as equity in the agreement but actually I don't think they would have received any royalties to date if if that had been the arrangement since I don't think mass gomas earning license from revenues some things developed in my lab to my knowledge my assessment is that by the University getting royalties getting getting equity rather than royalties I think the interest of the university's the inventors and the companies are better aligned because when one party wins the other party wins the company has to do well for anybody to benefit financially you don't start arguing about G you know academic institution thought this was really important the company doesn't think it's that important that's not a really pleasant thing to talk about although maybe somewhat unavoidable sometimes also in a small margin business like fuels it's quite possible to impede the progress of the technology by royalties and at a very important point I think this has been very good although not without risk for my lab I actually for nine months or so was the senior VP of R&D sort of acting senior VP of R&D from a stoma corporation and primarily had my office there rather than at Dartmouth and sought observe these conversations from both size of the form gee we could do this in house more or less that is in the company we could also subcontract to a university let's look at the pros and cons you know there's some advantages to a company doing things in-house there's also often some advantages to doing them in a university but I can tell you that if it meant to be if they come up with anything we have to go through a whole new royalty negotiation royalty negotiations take time and money no matter whether these in invention is applied or not it can be a significant disincentive and so this arrangement in my view made masks ohmic feel quite free to let my lab work on important stuff because if we came up with something there was no new negotiation it was all pre-negotiated so I think the form of a tech transfer agreement can positively or negatively impact the academics research opportunities going forward and I actually had a negative experience with that although a small one I have very active research collaboration with an academic lab an international one not Dartmouth in fact a very close friendship and as well as collegial relationship and collaboration with an academic institution internationally prior to Mascoma being funded in this articular case Dartmouth negotiated an agreement that included royalties I warned them at the time I said you know I don't in this particular area has skills that the company does not have and due to the dynamic i diced grunt described before i predicted quite accurately that if the if a royalty agreement was put in place Moscow would just do it and my lab would not do it and that's what happened and so essentially a collaboration in that case was essentially killed that collaboration the friendship is still there but the collaboration has never been revived in six years and I think it was because of the way the intellectual property agreement was structured so it may not be obvious and maybe it is but in my view how these things are structured as the point says really does impact what opportunities and academic will and won't have going forward so in terms of the landscape you've got the company you've got the academic investigator and you've got the university and so the company is interested in affordable technology access they're interested in exclusivity and control for the simple reason that they can potentially if it's a good idea they can make an awful lot more money out of it if though if you people can't get it from someone else they are disinterested in repetitive royalty negotiations as I mentioned the company perspective is and I produce to multiple companies that that inventors and their institutions often over value their IP compared to how enabling it actually is and again companies have to respond to very dynamic market circumstances and especially in the startup game and even larger companies may really change their identity sometimes in remarkably small periods of time for the university they're interested in economic returns most I've had a few conversations with representatives of University IP offices and I actually think that the biggest their biggest priority is to actually have the bent the technology bass at the world but as I might have written here and with once said to me they don't want to look stupid I mean if someone does make a whole heck of a lot of money they hey don't want to look stupid or does not want to look foolish there's a big ifference in my experience big range of the degree to which entrepreneurship is and is not both in stated intent but also in action a priority amongst different universities I think some of them have a much more entrepreneurial II friendly culture than others of course the academic side we would like to see something happen with our technology we'd like to see some economic return we'd like to have a satisfying experience we would like to pave the way for future opportunities and change and loss of control may be hard to accept I once had a good friend who was has been in an act in academia but also in industry and in the venture capitalist industry so actually has been in all three parts of the triangle here say to me that that during the period of time he was working with VCS that his single biggest challenge was dysfunctional technical founders and as I think I talked about right a little on this next one there are there are various ways the ball can roll down a hill as a technical founder into a not very functional relationship you know going into this the technical founder of knew all about it and it was their baby and they had control over it and gradually people in the company know more and more about it and often the the governance mechanisms don't let me you certainly don't have absolute control you have to work within the governance mechanisms and it's it's I think a fact that within  months or two years of when a lot of companies are founded initially everything's rosy and often you've got a disgruntled technical founder afterwards understanding different parties interests can be and realities can be a start to avoiding this and it takes work I has sort of set it as a goal to not fall into this gutter and be a functional technical founder and so far so good it's been quite a while a ride with several ups and downs and overalls going very well I might add but just be aware that this is not an easy thing to do and if a lot of people have failed at it and it's obviously not just the founder who fails at it it's you know a bilateral or trilateral relationship so just a couple of clothes are three or four closing perspectives there is a very large range of perceptiveness and permissiveness of different institutions toward entrepreneurial activity at Dartmouth for example which I consider to be a supra naw really friendly place academics can be equity holding officers they can be a chief executive officers as far as i know many universities don't allow that I would urge you even if you have no experience in companies to let your opinion be known from the beginning you probably see more than you may give yourself credit for I think God was a little bit too quiet at the start but don't expect to be in control it's probably not going to happen this a tricky what an important one there's somethin indeed quite a bit of activity that can legitimately be double counted by both academic and entrepreneurial missions and masters so for example if a company funds a grant of my lab with the agreement that the work will be published and the students will be trained and all the rest of it you know I can be doing things with the same amount of time and I'm pretty much serving both masters but there's a lot of activity as well that cannot be double counted and it is really vital to know the difference when you should be on the company's meter when you should be on the academic institutions meter and whose interest you're representing when so it's it is a conflict of interest it's a manageable conflict of interest but fundamentally when the one does need to manage it and deal with it carefully and then really in general and professional or for that matter of personal life you know if you're unfamiliar with the entrepreneurial arena and maybe you're tempted to try to be somebody or something you're not it won't work be yourself it's always in my opinion the most effective strategy so that's all I have we've still got  minutes left and Josh I'm happy to be in dialogue with you and then it's really up to you to manage how we enter into the Q&A with people who are on the line great so just to re-emphasize here's Josh gold from RP you know the majority of this session is about Q&A from the audience and addressing your questions and comments and we've got a few in already so please continue to send it in there's a for those of you are logged in there's a chat function on the right hand side and we are taking and are looking at QA and lee the first question one of the first questions we got in was you know you were talking about the importance of the IP agreement the technology transfer deal with your academic institution so as it relates to math coma with Dartmouth interested in any upfront cash so for instance to cover the cost of filing patents on your inventions that's the first question we got in well there's some aspects of this agreement I don't fully remember it was awhile ago and there's some that I do remember and probably can't or shouldn't disclose fully but it's been my experience in general that once an agreement is formed that companies that obtained intellectual rights to inventions are very often this fact I think usually asked to pay for the prosecution of the patents that's probably and then going forward once an agreement is is is reached I think that's probably all I ought to say about that it's really ultimately several institutions or organizations businesses in addition to my own in fact primarily this is a these agreements are between a university and a company I'm a sort of somewhat of a spectator so I'm going to be a little cautious about details of somebody else's agreement no we completely understand that so one of the one of the other questions we had was it gets to determining whether your idea you know you mentioned in your presentation that the world part of how this all came about is that the world came to you and so a broader way I guess of asking that question and something we've had that came in was how did you go about determining whether what you invented was worthy of trying to spin out into a standalone company you know what were the indications that let you know that was a worthwhile activity or you know in in other cases it may not have been a worthwhile activity how did you know that yeah in some ways my approach wasn't all that systematic and I tried to indicate you know that I pretty much made a commitment to this field and it's only a slight oversimplification that I'm pretty much was pretty much always leaning on the door and it was closed for a long time and already it's already opened which isn't indicative of a incredibly astute evaluation process so really essentially I was I mean it was quite a small field until until the funding went up both private and public sector again in the 05 07 time frame there was this huge ramp up so I was there doing by saying wanting to have an impact on the world took a flier at starting a company much earlier I wasn't actively looking at it continuously but heck when my area heated up I was all ears some people contacted me and essentially the market decided that people were willing to invest so I'm sorry if that doesn't seem to answer the question but I think it is really the case that I was pretty much ready when the world was ready and once they were ready it happened sure ya know there's there's there certainly I'd here at RB we sing we see all the time that there's here's activities and interests and movement in the marketplace that no one can accurately predict and it one of you know all of those externalities can be really impactful as to whether a company and idea technology is ultimately successful so I think that's an entirely fair answer going back to the technology transfer front one of the questions we got is around technology transfer p employees you know what whether you felt you were you were assisted or not if you were to go back and look at it today you know what are the some some of the key things that you know a university IEP transfer group a technology transfer group could be helpful in providing to university inventor like yourself whether those are services you know what what sort of what sort of help whether you received it or not would have been would have been useful to you yeah so I think let's assume for the moment that the intellectual property organization of the university has a desire to help entrepreneurs well if they do then one thing they can I mean first of all they can in no particular order they can make introductions I know it Dartmouth there's for example at the engineering school there's the network of alums and overseers and whatnot who've invested in more than one spinoff from the fair school of engineering and so to the extent that such groups can be cultivated that want to see what's coming out of the unit of a university and then when some inventor comes along and says hey I think I might have one here they can make introductions that can be very helpful I think you know counseling academics that haven't been through this before you know giving them some feedback as to you know when what they have might be market-ready and when they would do better to write another grant proposal ways to protect intellectual property as you proceed you know going around to let universities and academic the academicians know what they should be aware of before they start thinking of a company to sort of not preclude that possibility so I think in general sort of letting letting the academics know that that they're there to catalyze something to lower the activation energy of something and you know that there's interest in receptiveness in all the ways i mentioned i actually think that's a great deal that a university IP office can do to to lower the activation energy and increase the chances of success both for the company but also to help craft things in ways that are beneficial to the academic i think collecting experience not only from that University but I know that tech transfer people from different universities get together and have conferences and talk about what works and what doesn't work so does it awful lot that I think can be shared beneficially with with the academics that may know a great deal about their field but are often doing the entrepreneurial thing for the first time sure and you know your presentation today went through a lot of the lessons you learned of things to do when you're the person inventing that the technology and helping to spin it out one great question we have is what are the top two to three things to not do you know what are the mistakes to avoid you mentioned you mentioned the royalty trap and ensuring that you know the incentives of the parties are aligned are there other traps or key you know key key problems to avoid in your experience well let me think about that for a minute um it's a perfectly good question I when I mentioned this I would avoid having the expectation of being in control I don't think it happens often and that can be pretty disappointing if you if you go in with that expectation yeah that's okay we can okay I'd be very careful to have a don't mean to imply i didn't but i'd be very careful to havewell activo personally trust the people that you end up being reliant upon and there's a whole network of people you're reliant upon when you start a business the people you're working with the people that you're getting money from etc but I would also pay attention to to aligning interests and it and be thoughtful about what the interest of the other parties are you know their interest maybe involving you or you know corralling your technology etc and I'm not saying look for problems but but going open-eyed about you know what the various interests are and what various people's criteria for success are and try to make as sure as you can of those are aligned and so speaking of alignment of interests alignment of incentives we have a good question from someone who cited Brad Feld who's is a who the VC primarily in the technology space who suggested three challenges to startups at universities the first being a lack of rewards within the university incentive structure the second being a lack of resources and the third being a lack of profs campus club collaboration you know across the university so to what extent do you agree with that and you know whether you agree with it or not what if anything does that say about what the tech transfer model should look like if it if it should be different than today okay so the first was lack of rewards what was the second lack of resources and the third was lack of collaboration yeah I think the first two for sure I think that there are probably more good ideas out there than there are people that start companies and I think part of it is that the people who could start the companies from a technical point of view may not think it's worth the trouble and that gets to the reward piece I think resources both financial and information is a crucial limiting factor it's much less clear to me that lack of collaboration across campus if I understood that correctly or across an institution first of all I think a lot of that happens but I don't know that that one is less clear to me but the first to really resonate yeah and so talking about you know whether talking about incentives in whether technical founders want to or are incented by you know if they encounter a neutral are incented to launch companies themselves you how have you encountered in your experience and this is a question up here you know whether to know you're the guy to run the company or not you know you mentioned being able and being willing to give up control you know how do you determine yeah I'm definitely the guy to do it or no I'm not or in your experience of someone else telling you that haha yeah and my experience um nobody invited me to run the company but since I'd never run a company and I wasn't prepared to do it full time I didn't much question that I frankly don't think I would have done particularly well and I think it's seldom it's seldom tried in its and and not all the times as it tried it successful it's not common for the technical founder to run the company and in general it's unlikely to be a good idea occasionally it is I mean obviously they're people who start their first company and say the heck with this professor stuff I'm going to this is more fun or more impactful or what I like I mean there are stories like that but I mean frankly i would urge most academics who want to stay academics to look very skeptically at the siren song of G I could run this thing well i guess i would say that i would urge people's default answer to be no and to be their own skeptic you know technical people should be skeptics be skeptical the proposition you ought to run it even if someone tells you so and think about what it means for your lifestyle tenured academics have tremendous amount of security nobody running a company has that kind of security especially a startup company and think about it it is clear either way think about your skill set and your experience i mean a lot of people who run companies aren't doing it for the first time and they learned a lot from the earlier times around the wheel so I would approach that proposition very cautiously going back to the tech transfer piece we got a number of questions on a related topic which is you know there is some effort and to you know how many hours of effort it tends to depend but there's some effort in patenting ideas there are some costs involved in that you've got to get that in most cases University IP office involved so did you ever think about the trade-off between the cost and time involved in patenting know that those ideas versus taking another approach so you know that can involve trade secrets that could involve it's probably not the most relevant in this case but it involved open source did you ever think about the trade-off there between you know the cost and time and patenting versus other approaches well as far as input I've had into Mac maskless activities definitely another one other words with my my chief scientific officer had on it's not always in a company's best interest to patent something which means you're telling the world what you're doing and if you're a startup company it means you're telling people with much bigger resources than yours both technically and legal point of view if it comes to haggling over IP means you're telling them what you're doing so while it can be very effective it's not always a good idea with my university hat on you know I mean one clear line we have is that if we if we accept funding at a institution that we see that has that tax status represents a nonprofit organization you know we can't be running a shop in the back room to the benefit of a company we need to be publishing work and if you're committed to publishing really the only way I know of that you can protect something which i also feel an obligation in the case of you know with the company funds things I certainly feel an obligation to protect their interest so patenting has always seemed like the only option I was aware of for the work at Dartmouth that was headed towards publication and so honestly no I haven't spent much time weighing other alternatives because I haven't been able to identify them given the circumstances I operate under and in talking about the different incentives and motivation of academic institution and a start-up one of the things we see all the time at RBE is grad students and those getting their PhD involved in in some of these efforts so and we also see that in many cases it to use a an overused term is you know it takes a village to get something off the ground so there's a variety of folks I'm sure who were who were instrumental in getting Mascoma in your case off the ground I wonder if you could shed some light on we've got a question around the PhD or academic you know graduate student experience in your project you know we're folks involved how were they involved in what if anything do you think those those folks got out of it hmm yeah so well I haven't worked the full day in the lab since 1987 which is neither a point of pride nor embarrassment but obviously if things are happening in the lab given that circumstances by people other than me so yes long before there was a company and throughout the time there's been a company there have been graduate students involved I miss before that Dartmouth took an equity stake and at the perceive the proceeds from that equity which would have to come to some sort of a liquidation event are distributed according to a formula which to to the inventors in retrospect I think that there could have been more given the nature of our agreement there could and perhaps should have been more attention paid to inventions and inventors inventions that hadn't yet happened yet and two ways to reward those people so I think that's one thing that that that might have been that this worth paying attention to you know there hasn't been a liquidation events for Dartmouth or for the for the students or for me for that matter so we're all still waiting and it says that it's unclear how that's going to it's too early to sort of pass judgment on all of that but you know aside from that you know all of us who work in universities sign an agreement that the intellectual property created here actually belongs to the University at least that's the case at every University I've ever heard of it may be legally required under the various legislative framework so I'm not sure about a lawyer but I think I think in general students have enjoyed being part of something that might matter and it's stimulating to work at the intersection of fundamentals and application and I think they also enjoy the company interaction because most of us whether we're headed towards a career in recent engineering and applied science whether we're headed for a career in academic or academia or industry we would like our work to make a difference and I think most of us understand that companies are probably a primary vehicle for doing that in most of our fields and so actual being close to a company and their priorities and watching this interface is stimulating and educational to students so you know there is a path to students benefiting financially from their contributions intellectual property they generate and I think that they also benefit in educational ways I've never had a talking never had a student come and complain that they felt that their interests were somehow being compromised because of a company being involved in funding the lab although I've had to reverse I've had positive feedback from students on that same issue several times interesting you know talking about benefits and benefits back to the University do you know you mentioned what you believe you you're not speaking on behalf of Dartmouth here obviously but you mentioned what you believed in your presentation Dartmouth thought of the tech transfer deal for mass coma do you know if if Dartmouth or others have done a cost-benefit analysis of you know what it costs to obtain the patents the IP and the filings versus you know what the benefits are in terms of giving it just giving it to companies and entrepreneurs and someone mentioned Penn State doing this doing this analysis I don't know if you've either seen that or or if you can comment on you know if you were to do a bit of brief cost-benefit analysis on in your head what that would look like okay let me just respond with an anecdote a few Dean's ago guy named Louis Duncan used to run the engineering school here and he was impressed with the founders of hewlett-packard if i'm not mistaken and he said you know history his strategy was if an institution bargains hard for  some slice of IP they're likely to get what they bargained for if on the other hand they're very generous to and not particularly restrictive or even prescriptive to the inventors their interests and return may be much better and my understanding is that I believe if she was Packard as  possible i have this wrong but that the the founders you know I've given tremendous amount of money over the years is their University of benefactors probably far far exceeding anything they the university ever could have bargained for and so Louis used to say you know I  kind of like the idea you look someone  in the eye you shake their hand and you  say I hope you are very successful and  very grateful okay sort of the  alternative approach to you know we've got our formula and we're going to make sure we get ours you know yeah back to  back to Mascoma a bit you talk about you  know your experience and you guys started with a build own operate business model for the company one  question we've got in here which i think is a good one and is common for many RPE awardees is talking a little bit about your experience about changing and iterating on the business model how did you recognize that you needed to change the business model and then how did you actually do it ok so there's to use here  there's Leland how did I recognize  anything and then there's mass coma how  did they recognize with some part of but a lot of else to it um at times the  market has a way of communicating rather clearly about your business model it's called cash flow I guess the most  relevant thing I can say is to just link your question that some star comment I made earlier which was when mascoma  first started I pretty much figured I'd look I'd never run a business and so who  was I to say but I did know a lot about the field and I think I was too reticent uh you know what you know just I think I should have spoken up more and so you know the fact that Mascoma is still still exists is testimony that they've aligned themselves somewhat successfully at  least with with with external market  realities many companies don't don't go last so I think that's about what I can say without I mean I don't want to go through actual specific discussions of how business plans changed and who recognized what and who didn't but it's vitally important than and I think it's quite common for small companies to change their business plan pretty radically and it can happen with with a  speed that is is really unfamiliar to most academics really unfamiliar and one other comment I apologize it's not directly related to your question but there really is a different skill set and not all academics have it and you know when I think about is somewhat of a stereotype but when I think about the different skill set of academic success and entrepreneurial success I know a lot of academics that like a lot of proposals with the general formula some such topic has widely been recognized to be important in the following contexts and it's generally been understood in these terms but in fact is significantly more complicated than that none of the guy who sorted out for you so in essence i think that there are many academics who at some level benefit from perpetuating and even propagating complexity and of course for something to work in the private sector it needs to deal with complexity where that exists this is true in science and that in academic work as well as entrepreneurial work but it's manifested differently you know the great technical and scientific work we remember it's when people found clarity within complexity the requirement to find clarity within complexity I would say is more stringent in the business world I think in the business world without clarity you're really unlikely to fail and while the greatest achievements in academia also involves finding clarity and complexity I know an awful lot of people who get by pretty darn well increasing propagating complexity rather than reducing it and that's not that's not a success formula in the private sector um speaking of the private sector we have a question about the role of fundraising for your for a company were you involved in the initial funding for Mascoma and if so in what way yeah I made the initial visits to the VCS who eventually invested and I also in at least one instance and a subsequent round had part of an hour conversation where I believe led the mess comas largest single investment so I there was an awful lot of fundraising that happened that I wasn't involved with but yes I've seen that side of it and I i was there either alone or with one other person and quite active in the discussions for the initial fundraising and thinking about you know Tiny's these two topics together here thinking about being involved in it in a private entity and being involved in the business world and then the skills and experiences you have as as someone who's at a university for the folks listening to this webinar who are out of university what would you suggest are the skills and experiences that those people would would do well to develop or try to develop while in a university setting that would enable them to be successful as entrepreneurs or as business people you know there's there's a there's a pat answer that involves learn a little bit about business understand the time value of money etc but frankly I think the things that determine business success for one entrepreneur are very intangible in other words I think there's some people who don't prepare for it at all and are nevertheless wonderful at it and there's a lot there people who may prepare all their lives and never really get it right and now that's a waffle e answer but I other people would have less but other people would have to de-stress them differently but honestly the way I look at it I think people should figure out what they like and what they're good at and they should follow those with with clarity and persistence and and it's that overlaps with the private sector fine i think if you sort of drive through the rearview mirror about what do i need to be this or that or the other thing you're not i think a lot of the most impactful people don't worry about that too much they just figure out look this is what i want to do this is how i want to make an impact and they charge ahead and they make stuff happen so again other people would give very coherent answers that would be very different but i would say find your passion and your priorities and you're good at and pursue them and you know if you chose well the rest of fall into place whenever you one thing that's it up there's so many different roles you can have within a company that and you don't always show there's another thing you don't always get to choose in my experience within companies people choose each other's roles for each other much more than an academia and this is part of the control thing I mean people sort of tell me where I can make a difference in where I can't and you know I'm not too much to say about it and I've adjusted to that and so partly because of that you know you could prepare for a role in corporate life that nobody would give you think it's more important to sort of really figure out a path to impact and pursue it and then I don't know things will work out you know one if I go back to one of your previous comments Lee and and think about the question in terms of you know what what do what you do or should folks at universities try to develop in terms of skills or experiences I mean when you talked about iterating on the business model when you talked about figuring out that that mascoma wouldn't best be a build own operate business model that you needed to do something different it seems and here I'm paraphrasing so tell me if I'm wrong it seems that what you said and how you did that successfully was you listen to what the market was telling you and you listen to what customers or potential customers worked we're telling you so that seems to be something that's pretty tangible that most folks if they're willing would be able to do in terms of going out and talking to the market and talking to customers and using that feedback and active listening to change your business model or technology am I am I paraphrasing correctly I think paying attention to environment and opportunity and being willing to change yeah those are real good skills and their skills that as i mentioned i think are more at a premium in business in an academia although there I can imagine people arguing with that statement but let's just say they are really at a premium and those those it's more like it's not so much as skill as it is kind of a an approach perhaps so I'm not sure it's something you get trained in so much is something that you develop within yourself through life experience at least some people do it that way but sure being you know pay attention to what's going on and and how things are changing and may differ from from what you assumed or what you used to think and being willing to be dynamic yeah those are great skills going going back to the fundraising question we got another one that can you comment the question is you  know can you comment a bit on what private sector investors look for and it start up in regards to IP specifically so you have that slide in when you walk through you know of the the different interests of the different parties involved so tell us a little bit about what you encountered when you went out to investors in terms of what they were asking for looking for in terms of IP what I encountered frankly was that the investors had done their homework and I think had were predisposed towards investing which is just only because I showed up at the right time and so to some extent the sale was mine to lose rather than to make so I didn't feel that there was this really difficult set of ultra critical hurdles I think the investors thought the time was right and could see that that are made the conclusion that that I could see a path that was of interest to them I mean I've heard investors give you know you know sort of a list of three or four points it's sort of a cliche but but people you know one invest in people at least as much as technology and I think people  often say more than technology so  they're looking for something with a big  upside they're looking for something with good people and they're looking for something with with protectable IP and those are I don't know one might add a couple to the list but those are considerations in my case although as I said I think you know the stereotype is you know you go into a disinterested in investor and win them over I don't think that was my experience I had very invested investors who've done their homework and were largely one over when I showed up and the last last question we have here back to the IP piece how did the licensing agreement that Dartmouth had with with math coma how did that if at all affect your ability to work with other companies as a university researcher in the field I'm active in it just trying to remember actually I i I'm not I'm not able to to work with other companies in this field is the bottom line so it affected that quite a bit and that's why I said it was that the the kind of agreement i have is not without risk but in my experience the good side of the agreement have have been much more that side of the sword is cut much better than the than any negative side but certainly that's something you know someone in your shoes would do well to be aware of I'm guessing you know meeting ended I that question so if they're if there's going to be an IP agreement between the academic institution and that you work at and a company you would do well to think of the impact on your ability as a researcher to do to work with with other companies it's a little bit like getting married I mean if you make an exclusive commitment to somebody you have a depth of relationship that you couldn't realize that you were playing the field but to give something up I mean it's a similar trade on sure sure well I just want to give one last housekeeping item which is to remind everyone that we are we have recorded the webinar so for everyone online today we'll be sending you a copy of the slides within a week and I know or I'm almost certainly positive that when we do send that those slides for the webinar that we are continuing to look for an ask for feedback about your RP University and so  if there's a topic you know that today raised or a topic that we haven't covered in our in our RV university please do let us know we develop these topics based on your feedback and and what we're seeing amongst our awardees so so look for that and and any feedback you have is much appreciated so with  that I'd really like to thank dr. Leland Dartmouth thank you so much I think this was a great webinar and we really appreciate your participation my pleasure i hope it's been useful to the peace who've spent an hour their time participating all right thank you you're welcome
