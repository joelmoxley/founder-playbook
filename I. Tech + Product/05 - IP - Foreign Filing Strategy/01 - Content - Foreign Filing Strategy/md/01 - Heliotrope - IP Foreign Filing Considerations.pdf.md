IP	Foreign	Filing	Considerations

In	order	to	minimize	the	high	costs	of	filing	foreign	patent	applications,	it	is	useful	to	define various	tiers	based on	the	commercial	importance	of	the	invention	in	question and	the	markets	in	which	one	intends	to	operate.

An	approach	that	has	worked	for	us	is	to	define	3	tiers	as	follows:
* Tier	1
    * Only	the	most	commercially	important	applications	where	you	would	file the most	broadly.		This	could	mean US,	Mexico,	selected	South	American	countries,	the	EPO	(covering	most	major	European	countries),	and	potentially	several	of	the	following	countries:	Saudi	Arabia,	India,	China,	South	Korea,	Australia,	and	Singapore
* Tier	2
    * Medium	commercial importance	applications	and/or	those	of	interest	to	selected	strategic	partners of	yours.		This	could	mean	US,	certain	South	American	countries,	EPO,	and	perhaps	China
* Tier	3
    * Patents	that	don’t	fall	into	either	of	the other	two	categories.	Typically	US	only

Expected filing costs	are	as	follows:
* Mexico,	various	South	American	countries,	Saudi Arabia,	China,	etc….	=	about	$5-$7k	due	to	translation	costs
* EPO	=	about	$7-$10k
* India,	Australia,	Singapore	=	$2-$3k	each	(filed	in	English)
* Japan	=	$6-$8k

These	are	only	general	guidelines	and	one	must	consider	the	factors such	as	their	business model,	market	dynamics,	and	strategic	partnerships	to	determine	the	exact	strategy	that	makes	most	sense for	their	company.
