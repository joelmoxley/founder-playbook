This paper by R.A. Lawes examines the costs of layer deposition of principal high aspect ratio micromachining techniques used in microsystems/ MEMS fabrication, particularly silicon surface micromachining, wet bulk etching, wafer bonding, and other methods using cost model COST-MEMS. Factor explored include: increases in the wafer size, decreases in chip area, and the effect of shipping costs on overall expense.
