This deck by Dev Gavaskar, Techno-Economic Modeling Principal at True North Venture Partners, provides an overview of the value of techno-economic modeling as a tool in quantitatively understanding whether a technology can be scaled up to be profitable, and what risk factors need to be addressed on the path to get there. These metrics include sensitivity, scale, applicable markets, and cost extremes. The presentation includes some in depth examples, including one on assessing a new chemical process technology, and another on determining an optimal factory flow process using this framework.
