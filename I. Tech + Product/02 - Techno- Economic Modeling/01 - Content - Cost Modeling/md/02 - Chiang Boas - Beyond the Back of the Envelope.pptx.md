This presentation by MIT Professor Yet-Ming Chiang and Ryan Boas, both affiliated with 24M, highlights the importance of shifting from thinking purely about technology to using a robust cost modelto tune the direction of your R&D when commercializing technology for impact. The presentation walks through the elements of a good cost model and argues that this approach will help avoid the 4 pitfalls of developing a technology without a guiding model.
