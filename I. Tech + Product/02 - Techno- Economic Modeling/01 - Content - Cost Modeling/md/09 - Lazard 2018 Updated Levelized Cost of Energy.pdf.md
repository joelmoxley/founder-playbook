Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”) analysis addresses the following topics:
 Comparative LCOE analysis for various generation technologies on a $/MWh basis, including sensitivities, as relevant, for U.S. federal tax
subsidies, fuel prices and costs of capital
 Illustration of how the LCOE of wind and utility-scale solar compare to the marginal cost of selected conventional generation technologies
 Historical LCOE comparison of various utility-scale generation technologies
 Illustration of the historical LCOE declines for wind and utility-scale solar technologies
 Illustration of how the LCOE of utility-scale solar compares to the LCOE of gas peaking and how the LCOE of wind compares to the LCOE of gas
combined cycle generation
 Comparison of assumed capital costs on a $/kW basis for various generation technologies
 Decomposition of the LCOE for various generation technologies by capital cost, fixed operations and maintenance expense, variable operations
and maintenance expense and fuel cost, as relevant
 A methodological overview of Lazard’s approach to our LCOE analysis
 Considerations regarding the usage characteristics and applicability of various generation technologies
 An illustrative comparison of the cost of carbon abatement of various Alternative Energy technologies relative to conventional generation
 Summary assumptions for Lazard’s LCOE analysis
 Summary of Lazard’s approach to comparing the LCOE for various conventional and Alternative Energy generation technologies
Other factors would also have a potentially significant effect on the results contained herein, but have not been examined in the scope of this
analysis. These additional factors, among others, could include: import tariffs; capacity value vs. energy value; stranded costs related to
distributed generation or otherwise; network upgrade, transmission, congestion or other integration-related costs; significant permitting or
other development costs, unless otherwise noted; and costs of complying with various environmental regulations (e.g., carbon emissions
offsets or emissions control systems). This analysis also does not address potential social and environmental externalities, including, for
example, the social costs and rate consequences for those who cannot afford distributed generation solutions, as well as the long-term
residual and societal consequences of various conventional generation technologies that are difficult to measure (e.g., nuclear waste
disposal, airborne pollutants, greenhouse gases, etc.)

Note: Here and throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, the analysis assumes 60% debt at 8% interest rate and 40% equity at 12% cost. Please see page titled “Levelized Cost of Energy Comparison—Sensitivity to

(1) Such observation does not take into account other factors that would also have a potentially significant effect on the results contained herein, but have not been examined in the scope of this analysis. These additional factors,
among others, could include: import tariffs; capacity value vs. energy value; stranded costs related to distributed generation or otherwise; network upgrade, transmission, congestion or other integration-related costs; significant

potential social and environmental externalities, including, for example, the social costs and rate consequences for those who cannot afford distribution generation solutions, as well as the long-term residual and societal
consequences of various conventional generation technologies that are difficult to measure (e.g., nuclear waste disposal, airborne pollutants, greenhouse gases, etc.).
(2) Unless otherwise indicated herein, the low end represents a single-axis tracking system and the high end represents a fixed-tilt design.
(3) Represents the estimated implied midpoint of the LCOE of offshore wind, assuming a capital cost range of approximately $2.25 – $3.80 per watt.
(4) Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis herein does not reflect decommissioning costs or the potential economic impacts of federal loan guarantees or other subsidies.
(5) Represents the midpoint of the marginal cost of operating fully depreciated coal and nuclear facilities, inclusive of decommissioning costs for nuclear facilities. Analysis assumes that the salvage value for a decommissioned coal
plant is equivalent to the decommissioning and site restoration costs. Inputs are derived from a benchmark of operating, fully depreciated coal and nuclear assets across the U.S. Capacity factors, fuel, variable and fixed operating
expenses are based on upper and lower quartile estimates derived from Lazard’s research. Please see page titled “Levelized Cost of Energy Comparison—Alternative Energy versus Marginal Cost of Selected Existing
Conventional Generation” for additional details.
(6) Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis herein reflects average of Northern Appalachian Upper Ohio River Barge and Pittsburgh Seam Rail coal. High end incorporates 90% carbon capture and compression. Does not include

Note: The sensitivity analysis presented on this page also includes sensitivities related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) of 2017. The TCJA contains several provisions that impact the
LCOE of various generation technologies (e.g., a reduced federal corporate income tax rate, an ability to elect immediate bonus depreciation, limitations on the deductibility of interest
expense and restrictions on the utilization of past net operating losses). On balance, the TCJA reduced the LCOE of conventional generation technologies and marginally increased the
LCOE for Alternative Energy technologies.
(1) The sensitivity analysis presented on this page assumes that projects qualify for the full ITC/PTC and have a capital structure that includes sponsor equity, tax equity and debt.
(2) The ITC for fuel cell technologies is capped at $1,500/0.5 kW of capacity.

A key consideration for utility-scale generation technologies is the impact of the availability and cost of capital(1) on LCOE values; availability
and cost of capital have a particularly significant impact on Alternative Energy generation technologies, whose costs reflect essentially the
return on, and of, the capital investment required to build them

As policymakers consider ways to limit carbon emissions, Lazard’s LCOE analysis provides insight into the implicit “costs of carbon
avoidance”, as measured by the abatement value offered by Alternative Energy generation technologies. This analysis suggests that policies
designed to promote wind and utility-scale solar development could be a particularly cost-effective means of limiting carbon emissions;
providing an implied value of carbon abatement of $26 – $34/Ton vs. Coal and $10 – $25/Ton vs. Gas Combined Cycle

Summary Considerations
L A Z A R D ’ S L E V E L I Z E D C O S T O F E N E R G Y A N A L Y S I S — V E R S I O N 1 2 . 0
Lazard has conducted this analysis comparing the LCOE for various conventional and Alternative Energy generation technologies in order to
understand which Alternative Energy generation technologies may be cost-competitive with conventional generation technologies, either now
or in the future, and under various operating assumptions, as well as to understand which technologies are best suited for various
applications based on locational requirements, dispatch characteristics and other factors. We find that Alternative Energy technologies are
complementary to conventional generation technologies, and believe that their use will be increasingly prevalent for a variety of reasons,
including environmental and social consequences of various conventional generation technologies, RPS requirements, carbon regulations,
continually improving economics as underlying technologies improve and production volumes increase and government subsidies in certain
regions.
In this analysis, Lazard’s approach was to determine the LCOE, on a $/MWh basis, that would provide an after-tax IRR to equity holders equal
to an assumed cost of equity capital. Certain assumptions (e.g., required debt and equity returns, capital structure, etc.) were identical for all
technologies in order to isolate the effects of key differentiated inputs such as investment costs, capacity factors, operating costs, fuel costs
(where relevant) and other important metrics on the LCOE. These inputs were originally developed with a leading consulting and engineering
firm to the Power & Energy Industry, augmented with Lazard’s commercial knowledge where relevant. This analysis (as well as previous
versions) has benefited from additional input from a wide variety of Industry participants.
Lazard has not manipulated capital costs or capital structure for various technologies, as the goal of the study was to compare the current
state of various generation technologies, rather than the benefits of financial engineering. The results contained in this study would be altered
by different assumptions regarding capital structure (e.g., increased use of leverage) or capital costs (e.g., a willingness to accept lower
returns than those assumed herein).
Key sensitivities examined included fuel costs and tax subsidies. Other factors would also have a potentially significant effect on the results
contained herein, but have not been examined in the scope of this current analysis. These additional factors, among others, could include:
import tariffs; capacity value vs. energy value; stranded costs related to distributed generation or otherwise; network upgrade, transmission,
congestion or other integration-related costs; significant permitting or other development costs, unless otherwise noted; and costs of
complying with various environmental regulations (e.g., carbon emissions offsets or emissions control systems). This analysis also does not
address potential social and environmental externalities, including, for example, the social costs and rate consequences for those who cannot
afford distribution generation solutions, as well as the long-term residual and societal consequences of various conventional generation
technologies that are difficult to measure (e.g., nuclear waste disposal, airborne pollutants, greenhouse gases, etc.).
