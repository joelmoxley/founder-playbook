This resource by Nico Pinkowski and Sean Cassady provides a brief overview of techno-economic modeling (TEM) for electrochemical systems, to help assess their economic viability of certain electrochemical processes.The document takes you from thermodynamic analysis, stoichiometric and flow rate modeling through electrochemical reactor modeling, generating system level schematics and costing, and finally ends by synthesizing the analysis to conclude on the feasibility of the technology in question.
