welcome to our Cadiz webinar on the introduction to cost modeling my name is Adam Duke and i've been working at our ve over the past year with project teams specifically on cost modeling so on behalf of the entire tech to market team here like to share with you some of the concepts that we found to be useful to vinny of our team we've got a simple presentation prepared for you today which is two parts on the first I'll established some definitions and try to paint the picture as to how cost modeling liked it into your overall effort and in the second part I'll go into a more detailed description of a cost model spreadsheet template that we've made to help kick-start your modeling effort so let's get started I'll talk about cost so what are we going to do with costs once we know it well by itself it's actually not that useful needs to be paired with the customers willingness to pay I which reflects the value that they get out of whatever product or service if you can provide something at a cost lower than the willingness to pays and you're on your way to creating value for yourself and for your investors you hope eventually to be able to set a selling price low enough to attract customers by forwarding some consumer surplus while still keeping enough profit to making it a worthwhile to make it a worthwhile endeavor for you now this should sound all pretty straightforward but ompleting a good techno economic analysis with sound estimates both cost and willingness to pay can sometimes be challenging one example might be as if your product undergoes a lot of further processing on its way to being integrated into some final system then your immediate customers willingness to pay may be difficult to estimate you may just have to draw analogies to similar products yours you're probably going to have to conduct several customer interviews and you're just going to need to find out you know what are the key performance parameters that they're looking for and you just make sure that you're you're hitting those but costs on the other hand is going to be something that you should have more insight into you and more control over so we're going to work on driving that from the bottom up don't talk about what it is exactly we're going to be modeling here in RV we tend to think of economic modeling for technology in roughly three levels have so let me walk through those now the first one is simplest one when you're just starting to take account of the basic materials and processes inherent to your product maybe this is a list of ingredients kind of addressed proportions not to get you to be able to steer your research towards maybe minimizing the use of the most expensive materials for components the next level is a full production cost model you're going to use this to determine all the resources required for app scale production so that includes not only materials but also labor and equipment things like that once you have this in hand you're going to be able to compare all the major cost factors against each other so you can start to make holistic decisions about materials components product configuration even product function and in a third level is a full business financial model so here you start to worry about things like cash flow timing of investments dynamics you know maybe ramping up production and sales and if you have multiple projects on your plate at the same time you want to have information for all of those here together in one place so you can make decisions about where to allocate the limited resources have your company so I'm like the first two level of the third level is usually going to be performed by someone with specific training outside of the technical research team but you're going to want to have that in hand before seeking out profit-driven investors after looking back over these three levels of modeling what these levels really represent is that different scope of what each model is trying to answer so of course within these they're also going to be widely varying levels of complexity so it's going to be important for you is to figure out from the beginning what it is that you're trying to get your model to answer and then just start out really really simple and over time as your understanding grows and as you mature your technology you can build up the sophistication as needed so most of our PE performers are going to be aiming for some kind of basic form of this production cost model so I'll just say a couple quick notes about that one is that you'll see I've got production and / operation written up here basically for some performers it just kind of makes more sense to emphasize and use the terminology around the production aspects of whatever products or material they may be making for other performers it makes more sense to kind of think along the lines of the operation of whatever final system that includes the technology that you create but because the cops market principles are pretty much the same between the two of these apps on the template that we have prepared that I'll get into you in the second part that is an example of this level of modeling we've gone ahead with production example so that's what we'll be talking about in the second half the last note I'll say is just reemphasize the fact that this is for AB scale production so we're not looking into the cost of maybe a developmental prototype so whether you know a skill is actually just one unit per year maybe it's a million units per year whatever it is you're trying to get the cost model to tell you if your technology turns out to be technically feasible can it also be economically feasible at a reasonable commercial scale ok so we've talked a little bit about what the cost modeling is we've talked about why you want to know cost so that you can achieve some prophets some time in the future let's talk for a few minutes about the fact that cost modeling should be important to you now also because it's going to be an enabler for your research and development there's a lot of ways this is true i'm just going to pop through three of them the first is that is going to integrate a cost model will integrate a lot of calculations together for you so that you can start to make holistic you can consider your system holistically so none of the individual calculations that you put into the cost model more likely to be you know that mind-bending that exciting maybe a lot of them you could kind of just do as a back-of-the-envelope whenever you felt the need but the real value of the cost model comes when you pull these pieces together and establish the relationship so that you can efficiently and quickly see what the system's level impacts are on some of the substance but the system's level impacts are of some of the technical details that you're going to be deciding over the course of your arpa-e project the second way the cops modeling is going to be an enabler for you is that it's going to help you identify your cost drivers you should use this to guide your research this is a really important point which you want to avoid is the situation where you have worked on your FB project for three years and it turns out you have been focusing all your effort on some piece of the technology that turns out to be a very minor cost contributor these instead during that same time you could have been focusing on something that's a more major cost contributor and as a result had a better chance of making a big impact in your technology area so your time is going to be spent most effectively most efficiently usually by focusing your creativity on simultaneously addressing the cost and the performance factors of your technology the last way the cops modeling has going to Nabal your research is it's going to give you a good content to communicate with the other stakeholders around your technology so this could be internally within your research team maybe you're going to use the result to help convince some of your teammates you know why they should be spending their time thinking about certain aspects of the technology versus others this also applies externally in a lot of ways the cops model is going to give you concrete results that you can check over with your industry advisors make it easy for them to help you check your understanding of how things work and also when it comes time to find more follow-on funding for your technology the cost model a compelling cost model is going to go a long way to convincing investors or maybe even government funders that while your technology is worth supporting and lastly when it comes time for negotiations with investors customers or even licensing partners having good confidence in your knowledge of the value of your own technology is going to give you a leg up and make sure that you secure the best deal for yourself last thing I'll just stay here that's something that kind of cool about cost modeling is dead you know once you started once you have it you're never really going to stop using it as the mature tech businesses use cost models on a daily daily basis to make all sorts of decisions so if this is a direction that you want to get you with your technology hopefully we'll be setting you up with a good foundation here on your arpa-e 10-year but it's not going to be something that you just put away whenever you're done being an RBI performer hopefully it's something you can you can keep in your front pocket and it will serve you well how long into the future so let's take a step back now and think about where you are with your technology because at this point you might be saying yeah all this cost modeling sounds great but this all just way too early there's there's too many unknowns around my technology to figure out you know what the profitability is is going to be but there's still a lot of ways that getting started on cost modeling now I can help you and just a couple of those are going to be at that you made first of all you may be surprised how good is it cost estimate you can come up with just by doing a little bit homework and secondly once you force yourself to start to build this model and put numbers down it's going to become apparent to you pretty quickly where the uncertainties lie where are your knowledge gaps this is going to guide you figure out where do you need to spend your time to go find out more information to make sure that you really understand the technology you're working with you may find that information either maybe in the lab that maybe through literature searches that may just be something you get on telephone defiant not in any case you'll know what you need to know so I just want to wrap up the first part of this presentation with one example of how a techno-economic analysis helped an actual RPE performer in this case there is a seedling project dealing with wave energy converters our the team had originally proposed to work on reducing the buoy costs by an order of magnitude from about fifty thousand dollars per buoy to about five thousand dollars this sounded great but it didn't take too long to discover that the buoy actually contributes pretty small portion of the overall cost of installing and operating he system which is more like on the rder of tens of millions of dollars so in their first quarter the team don't leap into a techno-economic analysis and identified a different bigger opportunity for lowering the overall cost of electricity coming out of these systems basically the way these wave energy converters work is that they have to be tuned to a narrow range of incoming of parameters of the incoming waves the state of the art was for this to be updated on an hourly basis or maybe even slower that never sulted in a lot of results in a lot of energy being missed so this team came up with a one potential path for improving the economic competitiveness of this technology is to enhance the capability to since the wave ocean environment and also feed that back to the wave energy converters at a much faster rate so maybe on the order of minutes or maybe even eventually on a wave by wave basis so the team charted out a good path forward that now you know this is the aspect of the technology that they're ocusing their effort on the project is going well so thank you to see engineering for letting us share this example what we consider to be a successful cost modeling outcome for an RPG performer and that is it for part one so hopefully by now you're feeling a little more comfortable with the concept of cost modeling maybe then you were even just 10 minutes ago and also hopefully you're ready to see a more detailed description of how to put this into practice because that's what we have in store for you next so let's go ahead and get into the template on this template we have built using the combined experience in the chapter market team both doing cost modeling out in industry and working with numerous performers that are beyond cops modeling so we think we've got a deliberately simple but effective organization that meant to make it as easy as possible for you to adopt and maintain this way out how to suit your own purposes we've also been very deliberate about what kind of values are calculated in this cos model and which values are not so again we're going to be trying to consider all the major cost factors that go into production also we've got a set up to treat production volume as an independent variable so we can see how the resource needs like labor and material I could scale with that so we'll show you how that's going to work and then beyond the cost model itself we've also got some cost analyses throw it in there just for example equally importantly maybe the things that we intentionally left out that otherwise might creep into your cost model so for instance we're not going to be concerning ourselves with the  tactical detailed of operating the  production line we'll get what we need to know out of this cost model with much less work just by thinking of all the  values as kind of rough maybe annual averages likewise we're not going to be digging deep into technical specifications of your product we're just going to do the minimum amount needed to characterize its costs and its performance we're also just doing as bad a case of a production line we're not going to go into the company financial structure either so we're just at focusing on the technology product itself and so this sheet on this chart lays out what all the eight sheets are that are in the template spreadsheet so from here you can see the flow has generally the first two sheep our summary information the next two sheets are the cost model itself the following two sheets address the value first to the customer and then to the producer for you then you have the cost analysis sheet at number seven which goes into a little bit more detail and characterizing our estimation and finally we've got the massive energy sheet which is just kind of a holding place for some of the more detailed technical calculations that you might want to perform so I'm going to go ahead now and just flip through the rest of these in order flip through all of these in order and a little bit more detail and try to show you how the pieces fit together so starting off at our very first sheet we've got the process block diagram which you can see down in the screenshot that we've built using just simple text boxes and arrows so you can look at each stage and between the name of the stage and the inputs to the stage and the outputs to the stage that are all shown there you can pretty easily understand what each step is doing and also by looking at the overall inputs in the overall output of this process that's going to show you where you are in the value chain and now you notice you'll notice that we've tried to stay agnostic to any RPE technology so we've made up a fake example of making sandwiches but you can see right away that we're dealing with has a very raw material here flour water and yeast we're making a rondo baking your own buns we're slicing our own meat that actually should say sliced cheese is the input so we're actually using cheese that's been pre flight to the point of me saying that now is that this is a place where you can capture decisions about what parts of the process you're going to insource versus what parts of the process are going to be outsourced lastly each of these blocks is going to receive its own treatment in the production model which you'll see in a few minutes from now so this is a really useful sheet for you to very quickly communicate across your team you know what are what are they in store for before they dig into some of the more detailed sheet in this document moving on to the next sheet is the result summary the way we have it set up right now this is just a passive sheet all these values are copied from elsewhere so I'm not going to talk about it very much here but I will say that if you find yourself repeatedly running different scenarios you know you might want to reconfigure this sheet in order to have it run those for you automatically and display the results side-by-side we're really you're just looking at you know what are the key inputs and output values that are coming out of the entire cost model here in one place together going into the next sheet is the production model and effects cheater operating expenses so this is really the heart the entire spreadsheet as we have a set up so we're going to take a few more minutes to talk about this one here this is where we're going to be tabulating up all the resources that are required for production and like I said before we actually have it set up to treat production volume as an independent variable so the way that is going to work out is that actually we're going to have to calculate backwards starting from the desired production volume of our final product backwards to find out what's the required throughput of the last step in our production process backwards from that to the throughput of the second to last step and on and on back to the throughput of the first step you know all to quantify how much of each production activity do we have to be performing and also all along the way we're going to be counting up costs and summing them up here and so that's basically what this sheet does let's go head to the next line and take a look at how it does it after looking down at the screenshot below you'll see that you'll see the information for the first stage of our production process in this case is making the dough so for each line item you've got up to three columns of numbers so let me just walk through what those are now so in the left most column numbers you have values that describe the process itself so these are going to be like in this case you can see we've got basically the proportions of the ingredients for our dough recipe listed there and the middle column is the daily consumption of each of these resources so that's going to be amazed on how many buns do we need to make each day to meet the beat and in the rightmost column we're looking at the cost of each resource / final production unit so this case dollars per sandwich that's found using cost rates such as like dollars per gram for flour but Daniel infant elsewhere on the sheet is just not shown here on the screen shot so if you go and look at the leftmost column you'll see that some of these numbers are blue and italicized and those are going to be your input variables so this is things that you or the user are going to need to enter in you know data specific to your own process there and all the other numbers that are just regular black text our calculations based on those infant variables so they all have formulas behind them that should just be able to tay put you know once you get this set up with all your own line items and ask you you look closely to see that you have to specify those inputs and outputs or the stage and there's nothing automatically linking the values for the two of those together so it's up to you to make sure that you've got the amounts and the proportions correct they're the only part of this that might get a little bit tricky is some of the operation items so if you look down at the bottom you see for instance cycle time is the last variable they have to define how long does it take and one piece of equipment to process one batch basically if you look below that required Rose TV production volume that number is what links this stage to the stage after it so basically using how many buns does the next stage need to eceive as input in order to satisfy the total production volume that we're aiming for taking that value and combining it with the number of buns that is produced per batch at this stage gives you the required recipe which tells you how many batches per day of this stage do you need to run once you have that number then you can combine the required various production volume for this stage along with the cycle time for this stage and that's going to tell you how many parallel production lines you need to have at this stage all running each doing their own batches all day in order to meet the satisfies the full throughput so that's pretty much it for this stage of the production process so what you see when you scroll down the sheet is this sort of data block repeated for each stage and then finally at the end there will be a few more line items that maybe don't belong exclusively to any one stage then at the bottom every all the expenses will just get summed up and yeah that's pretty much the nuts and bolts of this page I so moving on to the next sheet I've just laid out some of the more hairy formulas that are present in the this production model and a fact sheet let me talk about these now but they're just here for reference for you to look at later as you're poking around the one thing I will mention is that for things like labor electricity actually equally convenient to account for those on either a per batch basis or a production line basis if you do it on a product / production line basis they just need to remember to keep this utilization factor down as you're looking at this bottom formula here so that you're not charging yourself one hundred percent cost of this resource when maybe you have a line that is only using some value much less than that so that is it for the production line next we're going to go into the capital expenditures so in this sheet we're going to be listing out what's all the equipment and tools that we need in order to make our sandwiches and the way this is set up is so that you just enter the cost for one unit of each piece of equipment and this sheet will reach back to the previous sheet where we figured out how many parallel stations we needed in order to calculate what the total equipment costs going to be after each stage so if you want to compare running your production line with different pieces of equipment you might want to call them you know by different names here assign each their own price but then remember you will have to go back to the production model sheet and change the input and output and cycle time values you know to represent the new operating mode of the do piece of equipment the last thing this page does is it just counts up the four space that's required for all your equipment so you can get an estimate of the kind of rate you'll have to pay for your factory so that is it for the expenses moving on to sheet five we've got a very dramatically different sheet here in product performance this is going to be much more free form as the previous sheet it's going to be up to you each performer is going to have something different here and it's basically whatever you need to include in order to make a compelling case that your product your technology is worth the price so if you have a technology product that resembles something that's already in pretty wide use then maybe t's straightforward for you to just key in on a few specific performance parameters and evaluate those but in other cases maybe you're making something that looks totally new it doesn't operate it the same way that anything else does yet today in that case you may have to spend some more time in this sheet building out a kind of an operation model of how your product should operate and kind of build up an estimate of what the customers willingness to pay should be that way moving on from the customer value we are stepping into the financial sheet in which we've done a very simple accounting what the value of the production product project should be to the producer to you so basically walking through the screen shot here we have allocated the cost of the equipment over some number of units some number of sandwich is being produced so in this case we've got five years as a generic example for how long the equipment might last it could be totally different in your industry but we need that in order to come up with a fully loaded production costs so that you know exactly how much does each day which cost you to make so once you have that you can set an intelligent selling price for your product hopefully one that the market will support once you have that then you can go ahead and estimate your profitability and also very importantly calculate about how long it would take for you to make back in the upfront investment needed to start this production line now this sort of counting steps can get a lot more complicated really fast so we've just tried to make it as simple as possible and hopefully it's enough to kind of get you thinking and talking in terms that your investors are going to want to know about us moving on to the second to last sheet the cost analysis this is an interesting one where you're going to be able to take a closer look at this cost estimate that you've come up with and also start to kind of quantifies with the uncertainty around it so we've got three example analyses set up in it for you so I'll just go ahead and walk through those now the first one has done using a data table so if that's a functionality in Excel that you're not familiar with that encourage you to take a peek at some of the comments that we've added in the cells within the data to be able to show you how to set that up so we're using it to generate a tornado chart which you can just see the top of at the bottom of the screen shot you're basically what this is going to show you is how does your overall cost your fully loaded cost of producing these sandwiches how is that affected by changes in individual production factors so this is going to be a really powerful tool for you to find out what you're sensitive to in terms of costs the next analysis on this sheet that you can't see here in the screenshot those is set up pretty similarly except that deals only exclusively with production volume so taking a look at how costs scales with production volume that way you can witness the economies of scale you can also see where they maxed out after your particular production methods so that can give you an indication when you might want to switch to you know some larger piece of equipment for instance the last cost analysis that we have on this sheet as just a breakdown of the costs both by production stage and by resource category so that's really powerful tool for you to see where you're caught fly and therefore you know where does it make the most sense for you to spend time trying to make improvements as you think about manufacturability of your technology moving on to the very last sheet and the spreadsheet the mass and energy sheet just that before this one is just kind of a placeholder for where you might carry out some more detailed technical calculations I'd really advise you to strongly advise you to keep those separate keep those here to make sure that the other sheets in this in this whole spreadsheet are as clean and to the point as possible so that isn't you made it to the end hopefully by now you're a little bit more comfortable with how this template works what the different pieces are how they fit together and why you're ready to open up that Excel spreadsheet yourself and take a look around so i'll go ahead and wrap up this show with a few finishing thoughts first one is that we are going to strongly encourage you to get started early on your cost modeling it's going to make your life a lot easier later on and you don't have to know all the values right now you can just guess as placeholders while you get the framework in place and it's okay if it seems really hard to even get the first significant digit right now that is really hard to do if you haven't been practicing if you don't have very specific experience so just try to think about what are the factors that are going to be the largest and work on those first the second point is that you should feel free to use and adapt this spreadsheet add to your purposes to meet your meteor purposes somewhere for each performers the spreadsheet is going to be just what you need to get going and it's going to be as simple as just swapping out the line items for items that are relevant to your technology but for other RB performers this isn't going to be the case so don't feel like you need to be bound to this particular layout but just remember that we were very conscious in deciding what to include in it and what not to include it how we laid it out so lastly for you more entrepreneurial performers out there just remember that a good cock model is an essential tool to have completed before securing profit-driven investment but it's not the last step that you have to do before that so we hope that you arrive at a winning cost model but we're also going to encourage you to do a little more homework around your company finances before pitching and just remember that the topic that we did not cover in this presentation so that is that is it thanks for viewing I hope now you feel a lot more comfortable with the idea of cost modeling and you're ready to get started using it to make a positive impact on your research program if you have any questions or comments go ahead and talk to your RV e-tech the market advisor and they will be happy to help you explore more
