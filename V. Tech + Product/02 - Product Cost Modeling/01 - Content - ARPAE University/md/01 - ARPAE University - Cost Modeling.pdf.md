Introduction to Cost Modeling, Template Overview for Performers
ARPA-E Tech-to-Market
February 12, 2014


Outline
‣ Context for Cost Modeling
– Motivation, Definitions, and Examples
‣ Template Description
– Scope, Overview, Worksheet Details
‣ Final Remarks


Cost & Value
‣ Production cost (necessary but not sufficient by itself)
$
Cost
WTP
+
Value Created
Price
Consumer Surplus
Producer Surplus (Profit)
+ Willingness to pay (customer value)
 Value creation potential of product




Economic Modeling for Technology
Full Business Financial Model

Cash flow, dynamics of ramping production and varying sales, investments timing

Similar information for other projects competing for resources decision-making

Production / Operation Cost Model

Determine resources (and $$) required for at-scale production/operation

Tabulate material/component flow, labor & energy use, equipment, etc

Basic Materials & Process

Bill of Materials (BOM) – list of “ingredients”
Simple block diagram of production steps

Most performers aim for basic form of “Production Cost Model”



Cost Modeling Enables Research & Development
‣ Integrates calculations together for holistic consideration
‣ Identify cost drivers  steer research
‣ Communicate results with stakeholders
– Internal: R&D, Management, Marketing
– External: Industry Advisors, Investors, Customers, Licensing Partners



Modeling Benefits, Despite Uncertainty
‣ Possible concern:
“It’s too early—there is too much uncertainty to calculate exactly how profitable this company/product would be.”
‣ Modeling still beneficial:
– Make uncertainties explicit
– Identify most valuable improvements
– Develop targets, metrics
– Bound with theoretical limits
– Create thought framework for reducing uncertainties

Example Techno-Economic Analysis
‣ Wave Energy Converters
‣ Proposal
– Reduce buoy cost by order of magnitude
‣ Discovery
– Buoy contributes small portion of overall cost
‣ Opportunity
– Enhance wave sensing  boost output, achieve competitive cost of electricity

Template Scope
MODEL INCLUDES
* All major cost factors for production of saleable product
* Production model for bottom-up calculation of labor, material, and capital requirements to meet production volume
* Cost sensitivity and scaling analyses
* Estimated value of production project using sale price

MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE
* Operational details (e.g. schedule of work shifts)
* Minute product details
* Growth dynamics of business, production, or sales
* Company financial model (debt, equity, taxes, etc.)


Template Worksheets
# Sheet Name Description
1 Process Diagram “Hand-drawn” block diagram
2 Results Summary Displays key model inputs, outputs, essential analysis
3 Production Model & OpEx Step-by-step calculations: materials, labor, and production requirements (core of whole spreadsheet)
4 CapEx Building, equipment, tools, etc.
5 Product Performance   Performance metrics, tied to production model if possible, supporting product value to customer
6 Financial “Fully loaded” product cost, price, margin, payback period
7 Cost Analysis Sensitivity analysis, step-by-step breakdown, scaling
8 Mass & Energy Supporting calculations regarding materials and processes



Sheet 1: Process Diagram
‣ Capture the entire production process in easily understood format
– Descriptive step names and step-wise material inputs and outputs
– Establish modeling level of detail: each step to receive its own treatment in production model
– Overall inputs and output define position in value chain


Sheet 2: Results Summary
‣ Provides a quick-look at key model inputs and outputs
– May choose to link inputs from this page to quickly run and show multiple scenarios




Sheet 3: Production Model & OpEx (1/3)
‣ Builds up quantitative operating requirements for reaching desired production volume
– Calculate backwards: [production volume]  [throughput of last step]  [throughput of second-to-last step] … [throughput of first step]
– Requires definition of:
• Process-Step Properties: Batch Size; Cycle Time; Usage of Labor, Materials, Utilities; Yield, etc.
• Operational Availability: Days per Year, etc.
‣ Tabulates consumption and production
– Materials/Components, Labor, Utilities, Product
– Calculates and implements required parallel production stations, step-wise
– Using cost rates, calculates all operating expenses



Sheet 3: Production Model & OpEx (2/3)
‣ Batch definition grants flexibility
– Allows realistic, convenient units and conversion of units during steps
• Units must match between steps; convert units from input to output within a step
– For continuous process: maintain proportions, absolute values of materials and time can be arbitrarily small as needed




Sheet 3: Production Model & OpEx (3/3)
(1) Step-wise Required Gross Production Volume
Batch Output Quantity
Batch Input Quantity 1
batches per day
(step i)
batches per day
(step i+1)
Y: Yield
(e.g. 98%)
batch size conversion factor
(must be same units)
(2) Parallel Production Required
Min Req'd Prod Lines
Batch
Hours
Operating Day
Operating Hours
batches per day per line
maximum allowed utilization (e.g. 85%)
(3) Labor Required
(person-hrs/day)



Sheet 4: CapEx
‣ Calculate capital expenditures
– Equipment/machinery/tooling totals from per item price and number of stations
– Estimated floor space needed from equipment sizes (rent is in OpEx)



Sheet 5: Product Performance
‣ Calculate/capture quantitative performance metrics
– Tied to production model if possible
– Metrics selected based on customer needs and segmentation of market  supports target price and production volume
– May expand sheet to model product operation  estimate value, willingness to pay




Sheet 6: Financial
‣ Production project value calculation
– Capital Depreciation + OpEx  “Fully Loaded” Unit Production Cost
– Price, Margin  Revenue  Profit  Payback Period



Sheet 7: Cost Analysis
‣ A closer look at cost factors and uncertainties
– Single-variable sensitivity analysis: automatically calculate and display changes in fully loaded cost due to variation in model input variables
– Scaling of unit cost with production volume (including automatic re-calculation of OpEx and CapEx based on production requirements)
– Cost breakdown by production step and resource category



Sheet 8: Mass & Energy
‣ Calculations to provide or support values used in production model or product performance
– e.g. balancing chemical equations, thermodynamics, part count/mass derivation
– Housing calculations here maintains focus and clarity in other sheets
– (not populated in template)
