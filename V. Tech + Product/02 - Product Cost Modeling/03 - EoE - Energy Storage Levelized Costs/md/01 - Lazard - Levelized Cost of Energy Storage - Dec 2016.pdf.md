LAZARD LCOS V2.0
I Introduction and Executive Summary


LAZARD LCOS V2.0 I INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Storage Analysis (“LCOS”) addresses the following topics:
* Definition of a cost-oriented approach to energy storage technologies and applications
* Description of ten defined Use Cases for energy storage
* Description of selected energy storage technologies
* Analysis of LCOS for a number of use case and technology combinations
* Decomposition of the levelized cost of storage for various use case and technology combinations by total capital cost, operations and maintenance expense, charging cost, tax and other factors, as applicable
* Comparison and analysis of capital costs for various use case and technology combinations, including in respect of projected/expected capital cost declines for specific technologies
* Identification of a number of geographically distinct merchant, behind-the-meter illustrative energy storage systems and their related value propositions in a mixed-use case context
* Summary assumptions for the various use case and technology combinations examined, including detailed assumptions on charging costs

Energy storage systems are rated in terms of both instantaneous power capacity and potential energy output (or “usable energy”). The instantaneous power capacity of an energy storage system is defined as the maximum output of the invertor (in MW, kW, etc.) under specific operational and physical conditions. The potential energy output of an energy storage system is defined as the maximum amount of energy (in MWh, kWh, etc.) the system can store at one point in time. Both capital cost divided by instantaneous power capacity and capital cost divided by potential energy output are common Industry conventions for cost quoting. This study principally describes capital costs in terms of potential energy output to capture the duration of the relevant energy storage system, as well as its capacity.

Throughout this study, use cases require fixed potential energy output values. Due to physical and operating conditions, some energy storage systems may need to be“oversized” on a usable energy basis to achieve these values. This oversizing results in depth of discharge over a single cycle that is less than 100% (i.e., some technologies must maintain a constant charge).

Other factors not covered in this report would also have a potentially significant effect on the results presented herein, but have not been examined in the scope of this current analysis. The analysis also does not address potential social and environmental externalities, including, for example, the long-term residual and societal  consequences of various conventional generation technologies (for which energy storage is a partial substitute) that are difficult to measure (e.g., nuclear waste disposal, environmental impacts, etc.).

While energy storage is a beneficiary of and sensitive to various tax subsidies, this report presents the LCOS on an unsubsidized basis to isolate and compare the technological and operational components of energy storage systems and use cases, as well as to present results that are applicable to a global energy storage market.

The inputs contained in the LCOS were developed by Lazard in consultation and partnership with Enovation Partners, a leading consultant to the Power & Energy Industry.

SELECTED COMMENTARY
* In Version 1.0 of Lazard’s LCOS study, we articulated a levelized cost framework to identify minimum costs per unit (MWh) of energy throughput to achieve illustrative equity returns, given levelized cost structures, capital structures and costs of capital
* Lazard has refined its LCOS methodology and report for  Version 2.0
    * Narrower LCOS ranges, reflecting revised technology/Use Case combinations (e.g., eliminating unfavorable technologies)
    * Revised Use Cases, better reflecting the current state of the energy storage market
    * Presentation of power-oriented Use Cases on both $/MW and $/MWh bases
* In addition, Lazard notes that the LCOS construct and related results may differ materially from the “value” of  storage (see page 4 for additional detail)
* To that end, we have included in this report a number of illustrative “Value Snapshots,” presenting illustrative “real world” behind-the-meter, merchant energy storage systems operating in selected geographical markets



II LCOS Methodology, Use Cases and Technology Overview

What is Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Storage Analysis?

Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Storage study analyzes the levelized costs associated with the leading energy storage technologies given a single assumed capital structure and cost of capital, and appropriate operational and cost assumptions derived from a robust survey of Industry participants
* The LCOS does not purport to measure the value associated with energy storage to Industry participants, as such value is necessarily situation-, market- and owner-dependent and belies this cost-oriented and “levelized” analysis

WHAT THE LCOS DOES
* Defines operational parameters associated with systems designed for each of the most prevalent use cases of storage
* Aggregates cost and operational survey data from original equipment manufacturers and energy storage developers, after validation from additional Industry participants/energy storage users
* Identifies an illustrative “base case” conventional alternative to each use case for energy storage, while acknowledging that in some use cases there is no conventional alternative (or such comparison may be only partially apt)
* Generates estimates of the installed cost over the indicated project life required to achieve certain levelized returns for various technologies, designed for a series of identified use cases
* Provides an “apples-to-apples” basis of comparison among various technologies within use cases
* Identifies a potential framework for evaluating energy storage against certain “base case” conventional alternatives within use cases
* Aggregates robust survey data to define range of future/expected capital cost decreases by technology

WHAT THE LCOS DOES NOT DO
* Identify the full range of use cases for energy storage, including “stacked” use cases (i.e., those in which multiple value streams are obtainable from a single storage installation)
* Authoritatively establish or predict prices for energy storage projects/products
* Propose that energy storage technologies be compared solely against a single conventional alternative
* Analyze the “value” of storage in any particular market context or to specific individuals/entities
* Purport to provide an “apples-to-apples” comparison to conventional or renewable electric generation
* Provide parameter values which by themselves are applicable to detailed project evaluation or resource planning

The Energy Storage Value Proposition—A Cost Approach
Understanding the economics of energy storage is challenging due to the highly tailored nature of potential value streams associated with an energy storage installation. Rather than focusing on the value available to energy storage installations, this study analyzes the levelized cost of energy storage technologies operationalized across a variety of use cases; the levelized cost of storage may then be compared to the more specific value streams available to particular installations

SELECTED OBSERVATIONS
* While an energy storage system may be optimized for a particular use case requiring specified operating parameters (e.g., power rating, duration, etc.), other sources of revenue may also be available for a given system
    * For example, a single energy storage system could theoretically be designed to capture value through both providing frequency regulation for a wholesale market and enabling deferral of an investment in a substation upgrade
* Energy storage systems are sized and developed to solve for one or more specific revenue streams, as the operating requirements of one use case may preclude efficient/economic operations in another use case for the same system (e.g., frequency regulation vs. PV integration)
* The total of all potential value streams available for a given system thus defines the maximum, economically viable cost for that system
* Importantly, incremental sources of revenue may only become available as costs (or elements of levelized cost) decrease below a certain value

(a) Presented here as the simple sum of all available value streams. Due to operational and other factors, such “stacked” value would likely differ from the simple sum of all value streams in practice.

Overview of Selected Energy Storage Technologies
There are a wide variety of energy storage technologies currently available and in development; some technologies are better suited to particular Use Cases or other operational requirements (e.g., geological considerations for compressed air, heat considerations for lithium-ion and sodium, etc.) than are competing technologies

DESCRIPTION EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE
COMPRESSED AIR 
* Compressed Air Energy Storage (“CAES”) uses electricity to compress air into confined spaces (e.g., underground mines, salt caverns, etc.) where the pressurized air is stored. When required, this pressurized air is released to drive the compressor of a natural gas turbine 20 years

FLOW BATTERY‡
* Flow batteries contain two electrolyte solutions in two separate tanks, circulated through two independent loops; when connected to a load, the migration of electrons from the negative to positive electrolyte solution creates a current
* The subcategories of flow batteries are defined by the chemical composition of the electrolyte solution; the most prevalent of such solutions are vanadium and zinc-bromine. Other solutions include zinc-chloride, ferrochrome and zinc chromate 10 – 20 years

FLYWHEEL
* Flywheels are mechanical devices that spin at high speeds, storing electricity as rotational energy, which is released by decelerating the flywheel’s rotor, releasing quick bursts of energy (i.e., high power and short duration) or releasing energy slowly (i.e., low power and long duration), depending on short duration or long duration flywheel technology, respectively
* Typically, maintenance is minimal and lifespans are greater than most battery technologies 20+ years

LEAD-ACID‡
* Lead-acid batteries were invented in the 19th century and are the oldest and most common batteries; they are low-cost and adaptable to numerous uses (e.g., electric vehicles, off-grid power systems, uninterruptible power supplies, etc.)
* “Advanced” lead-acid battery technology combines standard lead-acid battery technology with ultra-capacitors; these technologies increase efficiency and lifetimes and improve partial state-of-charge operability(b) 5 – 10 years

LITHIUM-ION‡
* Lithium-ion batteries are relatively established and have historically been used in the electronics and advanced transportation industries; they are increasingly replacing lead-acid batteries in many applications, and have relatively high energy density, low self-discharge and high charging efficiency
* Lithium-ion systems designed for energy applications are designed to have a higher efficiency and longer life at slower discharges, while systems designed for power applications are designed to support faster charging and discharging rates, requiring extra capital equipment 5 – 10 years

PUMPED HYDRO 
* Pumped hydro storage makes use of two vertically separated water reservoirs, using low cost electricity to pump water from the lower to the higher reservoir and running as a conventional hydro power plant during high electricity cost periods 20+ years

SODIUM‡ 
* “High temperature”/“liquid-electrolyte-flow” sodium batteries have high power and energy density and are designed for large commercial and utility scale projects; “low temperature” batteries are designed for residential and small commercial applications 10 years

THERMAL
* Thermal energy storage uses conventional cryogenic technology, compressing and storing air into a liquid form (charging) then releasing it at a later time (discharge). Best suited for large-scale applications; the technology is still emerging, but has a number of units in early development and operation 20+ years

ZINC‡
* Zinc batteries cover a wide range of possible technology variations, including metal-air derivatives; they are non-toxic, non-combustible and potentially low-cost due to the abundance of the primary metal; however, this technology remains unproven in widespread
commercial deployment 10 years

(a) Indicates general ranges of useful economic life for a given family of technology. Useful life will vary in practice depending on sub-technology, intensity of use/cycling, engineering factors, etc
(b) Advanced lead-acid is an emerging technology with wider potential applications and greater cost than traditional lead-acid batteries.

IV Illustrative Energy Storage Value Snapshots


Illustrative Value Snapshots—Introduction
While the LCOS methodology allows for “apples-to-apples” comparisons within Use Cases, it is narrowly focused on costs, based on an extensive survey of suppliers and market participants. To supplement this LCOS analysis, we have included in this report several “Illustrative Value Snapshots” that show typical economics associated with merchant behind-the-meter storage projects in a variety of geographies
22
* Based on illustrative storage systems configured to capture value streams available in a number of ISOs/RTOs
* Includes revenue from serving RTO markets and delivering customer cost savings, assuming relevant market and contractual rules
* Load profiles applied based on U.S. DOE’s standard medium/large-sized commercial building profile load, adjusted for regional differences
* Specific tariff rates reflect medium or large commercial power with peak load floors and caps of 10kW and 100kW, respectively; assumes demand charges ranging from $4 to $53 per peak kW, depending on jurisdiction
* Assumes state-level, non-tax-oriented incentive payments (e.g., SGIP in California and DMP in New York) are treated as taxable income for federal income tax purposes(a)
* Cost estimates(b) based on LCOS framework (i.e., assumptions regarding O&M, warranties, etc.), but sized to reflect the system configuration described above
* System size and performance adjusted to capture multiple value streams and to reflect estimated regional differences in system installation costs, based on survey data and proprietary Enovation Partners case experience
* System costs based on individual component (lithium-ion battery, inverter, etc.) sizing based on the needs determined in the analysis
* Operational performance specifications required to serve various modeled revenue streams, based on lithium-ion system in LCOS v2.0 (cycling life, Depth of Discharge, etc.)
* System economic viability described by Illustrative Value Snapshot-levered IRR(c)
(a) Based on discussions with developers of merchant storage projects in New York and California.
(b) “Costs” for Illustrative Value Snapshots denote actual cost-oriented line items, not “LCOS” costs (i.e., $/MWh required to satisfy assumed equity cost of capital).
(c) This report does not attempt to determine “base” or “typical” IRRs associated with a given market or region. Results and viability are purely illustrative and may differ from actual project results.

Illustrative Value Snapshots—Summary Results and Assumptions
Source: DOE, Lazard and Enovation Partners estimates.
(a) Percentages reflect share of total project revenue and cost savings associated with each source of such revenue/cost savings. Spinning reserve payments excluded from analysis, as such payments, though theoretically available, would account for less than 1% of total revenues.
(b) Modeled percentages do not include Peak Load Contribution (“PLC”) benefits, which were added in after storage use case optimization.
(c) Includes 60% Self-Generation Incentive Program (“SGIP”) incentive. See subsequent pages for additional detail.
(d) Includes 50% Demand Management Program (“DMP”) incentive. See subsequent pages for additional detail.
(e) Systems are considered economically viable if they generate levered returns over 10%, potentially viable if they generate levered returns over 8% and not viable if they fail to achieve 8% levered returns. Required returns/hurdle rates may vary in practice by market participant.
(f) Assumes NYISO Zone J. Assumes FDNY will, at some point in the future, authorize the use of Lithium-Ion batteries for commercial purposes.
