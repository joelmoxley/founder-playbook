There is a lot to consider when building a robust IP strategy. Deciding whether to seek patent protection is a crucial decision for an inventor. Do you know whether your invention is patentable? If so, how do you balance the cost of filing with the breadth of coverage around the world?

ARPA-E Univeristy hosted Michael Ward, a partner at Morrison Foerster, to address the decision-making process in choosing how to protect an invention. He also discussed the difference between patentability and patent infringement.

ARPA-E University: Energy Innovation and IP Strategy


welcome everybody thank you for joining today on the next slide I have the agenda for today's discussion I'm going to talk a little bit about an introduction to intellectual property then I'm going to talk a little bit about trade secrets patents patent ownership licensing options and then if we have time also talk about what investors are looking for regarding intellectual property and also a bit about patentability and freedom to operate this is a talk that I give frequently and I haven't given it as a webinar yet so most of the time I'm giving it to an audience so it's usually driven by the questions of the audience so please do submit your questions and I will take them as as we go along and answer them because I want to make sure that I cover the topics that are of most interest to you so on the next slide the fundamental question and where we start from is does IP matter what why do we care about intellectual property and 16there was a survey that was performed of Fortune 500 companies that estimated that between 45 to 75 percent of the wealth of those companies comes from their intellectual property rights so IP does matter it often particularly for smaller companies is all they have so IP is key so on the next slide what this slide covers is the types of intellectual property that are out there on the left portion of the slide we talked we have a listing of copyrights of copyrights relate to photographs software web pages and data pages then on the right patents there multiple different types of patents and patents cover inventions and designs the other type of intellectual property to trade secrets which cover secret invention methods customer lists tools those sorts of things and finally trademarks brands trade names and trade dress so these are the four main areas of intellectual property copyrights patents trade secrets and trademarks so the first thing I'd like to talk about on the next slide is patent and trade secrets and on the next slide summarize some of the similarities between patents and trade secrets patents and trade secrets protect ideas things such as processes formulations new ways to make things new software new devices those things can be protected by trade secrets they can also be protected by patents on the next slide a fundamental question you have to ask at the very beginning is should I protect something as a trade secret should I protect something as a patent if you decide to go the patent route you can no longer protect it as a trade secret so this is a fundamental determination that you have to make very early so when would you consider a trade secret you would consider a trade secret if the invention cannot be easily discovered or figured out you would consider a trade secret if the invention is simply not patentable one of the key advantages to a trade secret is that they last forever unlike patents which are only 20 years in length a trade secret of properly protected will last forever so this is a fundamental determination that you have to make early on now if something can be easily figured out or reverse engineered that is once it gets out there in the public somebody can look at it and say I could figure this out they can take it apart and reverse-engineer it that's something that you really would want to consider because if somebody can reverse-engineer it there's no trade secret there the next slide please talk a little bit about trade secrets they're really several types of trade secrets one of the main areas of trade secrets is business information this is a sort of information that's not patentable so you could never get a patent on it so it's something you want to keep as a trade secret types of things that are protectable is trade secrets market information customer lists you can imagine if you're a you're a company and you have a list of customers that you're selling your product to that list is highly important to your company and it's something you want to hold dear and close to the company something you want to keep it as a as a trade secret other things that you may want to keep as a trade secret is things that are inventions and know-how one of the best examples one of the longest kept trade secrets is that as a coke formula the coca-cola formula was maintained as a secret by the company for a very very long period of time and no one was able to reverse-engineer it and it's something that coca-cola was able to protect for a very very very long time so that's a good example of a trade secret all right now I want to talk a little bit about how you go about protecting a trade secret so you decide that you have something some information that you want to keep as a trade secret whether it's a formula such as a coke formula the some sort of method of making something in your company you want to decide you want to keep it as a trade secret so what does the law tell us about how to protect a trade secret well what the law says is you as a company have a duty of reasonable care that you must hold in order to protect that trade secret that means you can't publicly disclose it no public disclosure need to have confidentiality agreements with all employees and consultants so these are agreements where the employees and the consultants will agree to not disclose that information you also need to set up appropriate firewalls email security you need to think about encrypting your wireless communications one of the most important factors when you look at protecting trade secrets is this duty of reasonable care this changes over time what was reasonable  years ago frankly what was reasonable five years ago is no longer reasonable today in terms of keeping something as a secret the technology has greatly improved today we have much much better ways of keeping things secret than we had five years ago so what might have been reasonable five years ago is no longer reasonable today so you need to continually upgrade and improve your ways of keeping things secret so that you're acting reasonably is a reasonably prudent business person would so that's trade secrets now I'd like to turn my attention and talk a little bit about pets so in the next slide what are pets so patents protect inventions there is no such thing as a worldwide patent many many times I will see information and documents and letters and emails where people were referred to I have world worldwide patent on X no such thing exists there are no such thing as a worldwide patent patents are country-by-country you need if you want to get a patent us you can get a patent in us that only covers your invention in the United States you need one in Mexico you need mine in Mexico in Europe you can get a european patent that will be granted but then once that european patent is granted that patent must be further nationalized in each europe in country in order to have a patent in England you must or the UK you must get a european patent and then nationalize it in that country need to do so in France Germany etc patents our country by country no worldwide patents patents are also a governmental right to exclude others for a period of years and I'd like to illustrate that with the following slide ok you're looking at the slide wondering what is this well this is a glazed doughnut and I'd like to talk about this glazed doughnut to use it as an example in a way to explain how patents work and the example I like to give is the person who walks into my office and says I have a patent on the glazed doughnut and they asked the following question can I sell that glazed doughnut I just got a patent on my glazed doughnut can I sell that glazed doughnut so on all of you to write down on a piece of paper in front of you yes or no can the holder of the glazed doughnut patent sell that glazed doughnut the answer is it depends so what does it depend on well in this particular hypothetical that we're showing here it depends on a very broad patent that was issued to a guy named mr. donut it turns out mr. donut got a broad patent that covered all doughnuts so there's a broad dominant patent that's out there that covers all doughnuts so the holder of the patent for the glazed donut cannot sell his glazed donut unless he or she gets a license from the holder of the broad patent donut so you may be asking yourself well how could somebody get a patent on a glazed doughnut when there was already a patent on a regular doughnut well it turns out when the regular doughnut patent was written they did not stop to think about or disclose or mention anything about glazed doughnuts so that the inventor of the glazed doughnut was able to get a patent that distinguished or differed from the broader plain doughnut patent so you decide ok I see that there's a glazed doughnut out there I would like to be able to sell a doughnut with glaze and chocolate chips can you sell such a doughnut can you sell a doughnut that contains glaze and chocolate chips the answer is no you need a license in fact you need two licenses you need a license from the holder of the patent with the glazed doughnut you also need a license from the holder of the patent with the broad don't it clean so this is what is known as cross-licensing or licensing of various patents in order for you to practice so to repeat this the holder of the glazed donut donut patent cannot sell that glazed doughnut without a license from the holder of the broad donut pendant if you come along and decide you want to sell doughnuts with chocolate chips and glaze you need a license from the holder of the patent with the glazed donut and the holder of the broader pattern with the to the plain doughnut next slide please so this is the question that we just asked and we all know the answer is it depends next slide so what this donut patent example illustrates is a difference between patentability versus infringement patentability and infringement are two very important concepts in intellectual property law and they're very very different if you get a patent on an invention that does not give you as the inventor the right to sell your invention a patent only gives you the right to exclude others from making using selling importing and offering for sale your claimed invention I repeat if you have a patent that does not give you the right to sell your invention it only gives you the right to stop others from selling your invention you may have a patent but someone else may have a broader dominant patent again back to the example you may have the patent on the glazed donut but someone else may have a broader more dominant patent that covers all doughnuts so you can stop people from selling glazed doughnuts but the holder of the broader dominant patent can stop others from selling all doughnuts this is infringement has nothing to do with patentability the patentability is relates to the ability of the inventor to get a patent on the various inventions next slide please there are three main types of patents that are out there in the United States there are the utility patents these are the most common types of patents and these are the types of patents that would cover the doughnuts that we're talking about they cover new original and functional inventions there are also design patents that are out there some of you may have heard of the apple or follow the Apple V samsung case one of the key patents that was the subject of the apple of the samsung patent fringe meant litigation was a design patent that design patent covered the design of the Apple iPhone so it protects the appearance not the functionality or how it works a third type of patent available in the United States is the what we call plant patents these cover plants that reproduced asexually so things that reproduce plants that reproduce by cuttings plants that reproduce by like fruit trees and grapevines those are protectable as plant patents in contrast plants that reproduce sexually things like wheat barley corn broccoli lettuce those sorts of things those types of plants are protectable as utility patents all right plant patents cover plants that reproduce asexually such as trees utility patents cover plants that reproduce sexually next slide please Mike we have a question here about design patents and certain whether or not you could file a patent on design and then leave out certain elements as trade secret you can kind of blend those strip that's a good question and it's a complicated answer so the the the challenge with you know design patents are a little bit of a different type of patent in that it you know you really just have a picture of whatever it is that you're it's a drawing or a picture type of whatever it is that you're trying to protect so the underlying way by which you make it could still be potentially protectable as a trade secret in contrast if you were seeking utility protection on some aspect of the design for example say that the design produces a unique shape and in order to produce that unique shape you need a special type of metal or some sort of mixture of metals that when put together in a special way allow you to form that design you could get a claim a design patent on that design as being unique you could also potentially get a utility patent on the the combination of the metals that allows you to make that design what in that situation for the utility patent you could no longer protect it as a trade secret in contrast if you decided not to file utility patent but you filed a design patent you could then still try to keep the concept of combining the metals as a trade secret great so now I'm now on the slide with talks about the types of utility patents there are really two main types of utility patents the first is what we call a provisional patent application and the second is somewhat strangely referred to as a non-provisional patent application this is a name that developed over time is just a way to distinguish the two types provisional patent applications will never become a patent we file many of these types of patent applications and I just had a discussion on this very type of application yesterday with the university the university simply wanted us to take slides from a presentation and file them as a provisional patent application i push back very hard on the university and explain to them that I would not file such a patent application as a provisional patent application because the slides are not enough a provisional patent application needs to be written just like a non-provisional or a full utility patent application it needs to have claims it needs to have a good detailed description written for the provisional patent application in order for that provisional patent application to serve as a true priority document what that means is that provisional patent application when filed you can then go talk about it you can go publish and then a year after the visual patent application is filed you'd file what is known as a full utility or a non-provisional patent application claiming priority to the provisional patent application and be entitled to the priority date of the provisional patent application but that priority claim that going back to the provisional application is only good if that provisional patent application is a well-written complete document that you can point to where your invention isn't to the claims so my second bullet point there under provisional patent applications I think is critical do not skimp on your provisional patent applications do not simply file your slides do not simply file your manuscript you will come back to haunt you when you try to argue that you are entitled to a priority claim you need to write a good provisional patent application that should look identical to a full utility patent application next slide please alright what this does this slide illustrates the types of patent claim categories again this is for utility patents because for plant patents the third category that I talked about there's only one claim that's that's permitted it's a claim to the plant itself in contrast for utility patents we recommend that you claim your invention many many different ways you can claim the process you can claim the machine you can claim the composition of matter you can claim it as an article of manufacture there are many many different ways by which claims can be written and all these are permitted for utility patent applications next slide please the pattern requirements vary from country to country however they are generally all follow these same four requirements they may have different names in different countries but generally they follow the same four requirements it starts that the patent the invention must useful and must have some utility second the invention must be novel it must be new third the invention must be non obvious this is a word not obvious that differs in other countries you'll hear in Europe for example that the invention lacks inventive step inventive step is another way to say that an invention is non-obvious fourth the patent must have an adequate disclosure that this goes back to the point where I was talking about the importance of a provisional patent application having a detailed description the detailed disclosure as to what the invention is so let me go back and illustrate here some of these things novel what is novelty with respect to a patent claim novelty means that when you look at the elements of your claim for instance you're claiming a composition some new combination of chemicals where you have chemicals a B and C that's what you're trying to claim o what the Patent Office will do is perform a search and look to see if they can find any one single reference that contains a B and C all in the single single reference all right that is the novelty hurdle that you must overcome if the examiner is able to find a and B in one reference but not see your claim is still novel so the examiner must find all the elements in one single reference now for in this example where you're trying to claim a B and C if the examiner finds a and B in one reference and then find C and another reference you have overcome the novelty hurdle but what the examiner can give you is what is known as an obvious nose rejection that is you combine reference number one combined reference number two and you're able to find the elements a B and C that's an obvious pneus rejection that it would have been obvious to take a and B and combine it with see you as an applicant can rebut or attack such an obvious nison by saying no no one ever would have thought to put C together with a and B or when I put C in with a and B I get a synergistic result i get a fabulous result this thing works far better than anyone whatever what expected those are the ways that you rebut or combat an obvious miss projection that a plus B plus C no one ever did it before no one would ever expected it to work this well that's how yu overcome the obvious miss rejection in the united states or a inventive step rejection in europe and another countries the adequate disclosure requirements again are back to the example when i was talking about the provisional patent application it's very important that you described in tremendous detail your invention and what we call fallback positions that is you may have a variety of a B and C and in your patent application what you need to do is describe what are the various ways that a can be tweaked tweaked and varied what are the substitutes for a what are the substitutes for be what are the substitutes for see these are the fallback positions that give you breath and allows you to to support why you have an adequate disclosure so those are the patent requirements on the next slide I take you through the patent application process it's very important to get a patent attorney or patent and agent involved in your patent application process early I strongly urge you to speak with a patent attorney or a patent agent who understands your technology it's very important if you're working on an invention that relates to electric engineering that you talk to somebody who understands electrical engineering similarly if your invention relates to transgenic plants or something related to plants you need to talk to somebody who understands plants and understands transgenic plants and how to protect them and has experience in protecting them because there are specific issues that come up that vary from technology to technology so the patent application is written it's then set off to the US Patent Office the pad office then sends what is known as an office action rejecting the claims i would say in my career I've had maybe eight to ten patent applications in total where I did not get an office action rejecting the claims if you get an office action back from the Patent Office where they are what we call a first action allowance that is the examiners looked looked at your claims and allows them right away all that tells me is that I did not write my claims broadly enough and that I always feel badly that somehow I've left something on the table so getting an office action rejecting the claims is a good thing it's a it's a good part of the application process because you want to stretch and reach as broadly as you can you then once you get that office action the applicant will respond with some amendments some changes to the claims and some arguments refuting the rejection and send those back to the Patent Office the Patent Office may agree or may disagree at this stage if the Patent Office is still disagreeing you may want to consider an interview with the examiner interviews with the examiner used to be done on a face-to-face basis with the examiner that hardly ever happens anymore in the US Patent Office the reason that it hardly ever happens anymore on a face-to-face basis is that many of the patent examiner's in the US Patent Office are doing what is known as hotelling what hotelling means is they're really working from home we've had a couple of situations where we've tried to set up examiner interview use to have face-to-face meetings with the examiner and we've shown up and we've been taken to a conference room where we sat down in the conference room and what's on the table but a phone and the examiner is phoning in from home we can have that same phone call sitting in California or sitting in Hawaii or sitting wherever we want to be we don't need to be in the Patent Office to have those sorts of calls so we're seeing less and less interviews with the examiner because the examiners often just won't come in even when we ask them to come in in any event we have good luck with our interviews because we get the scientists or the engineers involved early the way to do that is to bring the scientist an engineer in set up a call with the examiner and then let the examiner and the engineer or a scientist talk about the invention remember that examiners are former scientists or former engineers they love the technology they rarely like to talk to patent attorneys they much prefer to talk to scientists they much prefer to talk to engineers so what we like to do is to let our engineers and scientists talk to the examiner explained it examiner what the invention is what the oh wow moment is what what they figured out in the lab and how they did it once you have that sorted out then it's merely a case of the patent attorney coming in to set up a how we're going to do the claims and once we've worked out the claim language the examiner will they neither allow the case but if the examiner still won't allow the case you have an opportunity to appeal up to the Patent Office Appeals Board and then hopefully next step will be the granted Pat so that is the patent application process next slide please alright patent ownership for those of you who have been inventors on pen applications you are you will call that you are sent certain documents to sign there's a document called declaration and there's a document called the assignment those are two documents that are required for the filing of the patent application the declaration document is required for the filing of the patent application what the declaration document does is declare that you are an inventor or a co-inventor with somebody else it's important to understand that you as an inventor own an equal and undivided interest in that patent application so the inventors sign that declaration stating that they're an inventor right you own it until you transfer your rights assign your rights to a company or a university when you join start to work for university or a company you sign an employment agreement and that employment agreement generally says that you agree to assign all your rights all your intellectual property rights to the company or the university that's what that assignment document does for that particular patent application until such time that you sign that document the you own it you own that intellectual property but you when you sign that assignment a document you transfer your rights to the company or to the University once the university or the company owns those rights they in turn may license those rights to somebody else so the flow of the rights are from the inventor who owns it who assigns his or her rights to the university or to the company once the company owns those rights they can then be licensed to somebody else so in my donut example when we had the donut patent the inventor of the donut patent the glazed donut owns that donut punt until he or she assigned his or her rights to a company or university once the company and our university has those rights they can intern license those rights to somebody else I next slide please so once those rights are owned or assigned to an entity either university or to a company then they can be licensed to somebody else so there are various different types of licenses so remember what the difference between an assignment and a license is there's a fundamental difference with an assignment you're transferring all ownership so the rights flow from you as the inventor to the company or institution and you know don't hold on to anything went when you're talking about a license a license is you still own the intellectual property but what you're doing is giving a license that is a promise that you won't sue somebody for patent infringement so there are various different types of licenses that can be granted you can give an exclusive license so you as a holder your company owns the rights to the donut pendant right you can decide you're only going to give one donut you're going to license exclusively to one donut shop or you can give a non-exclusive license that is you can give multiple non-exclusive licenses too many doughnut company so again exclusive versus non-exclusive you may have Geographic limitations the Geographic limitations maybe i'm going to give you rights in california i'm going to give somebody else writes in wisconsin i may give somebody else writes in mexico and somebody else writes in china again Geographic limitations you may have fields of use limitation you can use this invention to X somebody else can use the invention to do rise sublicense rights sublicense rights are those rights when you get a license from somebody you in turn can give a sublicense to somebody else so that the rights flow absent those rights specifically in your license you don't have the right to sub-license the key with licenses is it's the devil is in the details you need to make certain that the the language is explicit to cover the various things that you want to do you can also have option agreements you can have where you limit the time you can have cost you can up you negotiate upfront fees you can have fees that are downstream there's a variety of ways that things are going to be done all which must come back to and tied to your business strategy what is it that you're trying to do how are you trying to maximize things are you going to license this thing exclusively are you going to try to non exclusively licensed this thing you can imagine with most royalty streams that is what's a percentage of income that you're going to get from the sales that they're doing you know for an exclusive license that royalty might be quite high whereas with a non-exclusive license that royalty would necessarily be lower so that's a little bit on licensing options next slide please hey Mike before we move on there's just one question that someone has and kind of fits into the licensing discussion they're asking about you know what to what extent can someone perform research on a patented invention but you know not selling it but improving the invention you know maybe they're doing the research on that with the intention to sell do they need to have a license to perform that research or you know major I think that yeah really good question so a couple ways to to answer that so the first thing to understand is there is no research exception to patent infringement so what does that mean there was there was a case it was a related to Duke University where there was a Duke professor who got fired and left the university and had patents that he owned as it turned out Duke continued the research that was covered by the patents of the Duke professor and the Duke professor who's a bit disgruntled for being let go turned around and sued the University for patent infringement the university raised the defense and said look this is just research there's a research exception we can continue to to do this they didn't say that they didn't infringe they simply said that this you know what we're doing is researches it's not a commercial purposes in this case went all the way up to the highest patent court in the land the Federal Circuit and the Federal Circuit said no there is no research exception to patent infringement doing research is still patent infringement okay so what does that mean well practically speaking the the risk of being sued for research is very low the the the disgruntled Duke professor fact pattern that I just discussed doesn't happen very often and the reason is is that patent infringement is very very expensive litigation is extremely expensive millions and millions of dollars simply to get to a trial so before suing somebody a patent holder must think very very hard about the potential recovery that they may get at the end of the day okay so I'm not here saying though because it's so expensive you should not be concerned about patent infringement a prudent business person a prune company should understand what patents are out there and get a research license so that's when we talk about the various types of licenses that you can get these are typically non-exclusive research licenses which have very small upfront fees where you agree that all you're going to be doing is research and that that you won't be doing this anything commercially if you decide to do something commercially you have to go back and get a license so it's something you need to consult with your your business team and you're in your university setting your licensing office about understanding what licenses you may need for research and some circumstances you know there's agreements that are that are already been taking place but allow you to do certain research with licenses remember one of the questions we often get is professors and researchers will see patent applications that are out there with very broad claims that could potentially cover stuff that's being done in the laboratory remember that a patent application is just that it's an application there are no rights no rights that accrue until the patent has granted so the the patent infringement risks only start once the patent application has actually granted into a patent there are potential damages that can accrue from a published patent application where the claims are not amended much but that's a rare situation and something you would need to consult with a patent attorney to understand but it's a long-winded answer to say research is requires a license and you need to talk with your business people and your licensing office to make certain that you have the proper licenses in place one follow-up someone had on that is there is there an allowance for pre-licensing analysis and due diligence you know if you want to your prospective licensee you want to test the technology on your own bench before you get into a life yeah there can be you would want to you know negotiate that it's a you know I would not proceed just again to test stuff you know you can sort of test stuff out and check it out but there's a risk that of patent infringement that risk is again is low hard for people to find out what's going on in a laboratory setting but it's best to be upfront with people and say we'd like to try this out you know what sort of you know negotiate a very low sort of fee for doing so right thank you yep alright next slide all right but I like to talk a little bit about is is investors so you know you the idea of your either forming a company or you're going to work for a university or some research institution who's going to license that intellectual property to a start-up and you are associated with the startup or the startup you know is is looking for money and looking for money from investors what are the sorts of things investors look for regarding your intellectual property all right next slide please right it's important to understand that everybody counts patent applications and patents from the biggest companies from the IBM s and the Sony's of the world who constantly will you know on a yearly basis will send out a list that says we got you know 3,000 patents last year to the smallest startups everybody counts the number of patent applications and the number of patents in the portfolio so numbers matter alright so the next question they're going to ask us so you've got  patent applications or patent applications that are that the company says that they have rights too but the next question that investor is going to ask is are those puns properly assigned or licensed to the company so back to my scenario where i talked about you as an inventor own the intellectual property well if you have not assigned your rights to the company or it in the institution and that in turn that company their institution has licensed those rights to the company then those rights don't lie with the company so the investor is going to say well it's nice you have this list of intellectual property but these patents and patent applications have never been assigned so the license to the company is no good whatsoever at this stage until those rights flow so that's why those documents are so important the next question an investor is going to ask ok you have a product that you're going to want to sell do your patents or pen applications cover your products do they actually cover what you say you're going to do do you have patents and patent applications that are going to once issued prevent others from practicing in this space next question okay you got coverage for the product do they cover design around things that somebody might easily tweak again back to my original discussion when I talked about a and B and C in the various different ways that we want to write this in our patent application you want to make sure you cover tweaks to a tweaks to be tweaks to see those sorts of things the next question they're going to ask all right you've got patents in place are they valid is there prior art that's out there that may have novelty problems here where we talked about a and B and C is there a reference that's out there so they're going to ask other patents valid finally they're going to ask do you have freedom to operate next slide I want to talk about freedom operate what is freedom to operate alright there's a big difference between patentability verse freedom to operate patentability is is your invention patentable can you get a patent on your invention does your invention do your claims distinguish the prior art back to our earlier example a and B and C that's what we're trying to claim is there any prior art that's out there that discloses a and B and C alright that's patentability can you get append freedom to operate is a very very different question when investors come they are going to ask do you have ft oh do you have freedom to operate what they're asking is does the sale or use of your invention infringe a patent this was the question that we talked about early on in our discussion today when I said can the inventor the glazed doughnut sell his or her glazed doughnut does the doughnut manufacturer the glazed doughnut manufacturer have freedom to operate and the answer was no did not have freedom to operate it did not have FTO because there was somebody else out there with a dominant patent that covered all doughnuts all right so how do you as a company get F key oh how do you go to investors no no no we have ft 0 in this situation what you'd be able to do is to say well there is a broad patent out there that covers all doughnuts but we have a license we have a non-exclusive license to that technology that gives us freedom to operate right freedom to operate is meaning i can sell because i have a license from this company so those are the two key concepts that you're going to be asked if you're involved in a company is your stuff patentable do you have fq do you have freedom to operate all right next slide please want to talk just for a moment about strategic IP planning next slide please so what is strategic I pre-planning strategic IP planning means that you have a business strategy and your IP strategy aligns with your business strategy we often get asked calls from prospective clients can you help us can you represent us going forward we have this great idea we have this idea to sell glazed doughnuts can you help us with our intellectual property strategy the first question we ask we always ask is what is your business strategy send us a copy of your business plan many many times when we ask that question we just hear dead silence on the end of the line and look what the client or prospective client say I but don't have one yet and we say you have to have one you can't have an IP strategy without a business strategy you have to start with the business strategy you can't decide if I can't give you an IP strategy we can't guide you on your IP strategy unless we know what your business is going to be is your business going to be selling all around the world well then you're going to need to consider patents all around the world if your soul market is the United States well then intellectual property around the world isn't going to matter all you care about is us so it's important to start with your business strategy then get to the IP strategy it's also important as you work through this is that these things evolved they're constantly being tweaked as you hurt learn more about your business you need to go back and reevaluate the IP strategy conversely as you learn about your IP strategy oh this isn't protectable in these countries this isn't patentable we need to go back to the business strategy next slide please all right IP in your company what do you need to do as you you set up your company and you're going for it I think it's incredibly important that you establish an IP savvy culture you need management you need scientists and engineers need your business development team your finance professionals all on the same page they believe in IP they understand it it's important that you educate your company that IP is a valuable asset of the company my first slide today after the introduction was wide as IP matter IP matters because it's valuable asset of the company the company has an IP strategy and the employees are aware of that IP strategy 9and the company needs to know that they are implementing that IP strategy we have a strategy and we're following it and the employees understand that following that IP strategy is critical to the company's success it's very important that everyone's on board and everyone is aligned so that you can move forward with this the best example I can give and I've seen this with a number of companies as they get going is the business development people many times when you work with startups you'll see you have a core group of scientists and engineers who are wearing many many hats we the company they understand what's going on out there in the industry they understand what's going on in the lab so the company starts to grow they hire a business development person who's going to start to get out there and and interact with businesses around the world that BD person often gets disconnected to the IP folk all right 6there are running around doing their thing all that intelligence all that information that they have about what's going on in the business world they don't bring back to the company it's essential it's critical that that BD person is on the IP strategy team is a member of the IP committee because they're connected to society so that's my my presentation today are there any more questions that i can answer yeah we have a few more here you know one you know you were talking about wanting folks to have a business plan in mind and obviously it if there is a business plan that doesn't work out the question is you know what are the features of assignment you know that can be basically deal with patent rights in the event of a company failure or reorganization if you could speak to that so what happens in the event that the business fails and you're sitting on IP is that the kind of an eye yeah I think it's that and then also you know who who would own that or how when you're filing the patent how do you keep that kind of potential event in mind so hopefully that that potential event is is is not going to happen but in the event that happens it's important there's another reason why it's important that the company own things so I mean God forbid the company goes into bankruptcy that's an issue we've dealt with a lot over the last several years that there will be buyers of that potential IP but the only way that they can buy and secure the rights of that IP if that IP resides with the company so that the company can transfer those assets so again it goes back to who owns it it's important that the company owns it to that as a part of whatever is going on if somebody's going to come in and acquire it or if your bankruptcy or through some sort of acquisition and needs to to to rely and line up with the great and there's not a few questions about the America Invents Act and basically how you see that affecting you know your whole presentation today kind of what might have changed if you've been given this presentation for a while how does how does the way that you think about this change in light of that sure that's a good question the presentation wouldn't change at all and it's in it what the key there are several parts to the American Invents Act that affect us practice the fundamental change i'm sure most people have heard about is that we're moving from what used to be a first to invent system to what is known as a first-to-file system so in the US we used to give patents to those who are the first to invent everywhere else in the world has been under a first-to-file system that is you get to the Patent Office first you get the patent because almost every client that we represent work with cares about the rest of the world we've been operating under a first-to-file system for around the world for just about everybody and you you know the fact that that might be a different rule in the United States okay we would deal with that but we were still rushing to the Patent Office to get there quicker because you didn't want a situation where you might win in the United States and lose in Europe or elsewhere because you were slow to get to the Patent Office so that's one of the key changes that's taking place the other changes that are taking place really apply you know they're very special rules and frankly one of our concerns is that the the rules well the Patent Office has done their best so sort of lay things out and how they're going to play the there's we have a lot of questions about the various nitty-gritty of the rules and it's going to take some time through litigation various court cases for the interpretation of those cases to work their way through the system so as an example offers for sale and how that might affect the patentability of a claim when you look at the rules there's some questions about what what does that mean the chains are not changed and until such time that we get clarity from the court system we're not going to know so the advice is file early file often and that's been our advice for years even before the American Invents Act one question is especially you know here at RV we work with a lot of teams that are some of them just forming just getting their research started and then there we you know our coaching them on thinking about their path to market but what were maybe some broad rules of thumb you would use to to people who are in the early stages of their technology development process when should they start thinking about you know going through these exercises and and thinking through you know the quest the strategy pieces that you teed up trade circuit versus patentability you know and and and it may be not just when should they do that kind of in their own process but maybe other other rules of thumb in terms of balancing into the costs right you talked about surely you can bear Lyle all around the world and i think that's another piece especially with small entrepreneurial teams you might feel like okay well we need to get a lot of things defended but then you could also define yourself incurring these large ongoing costs sure i think that's a great great question and one of the things that i have found is people something they'll hear about patents and the potential blocking and and and you know concerns about that and they'll they'll spend time in the laboratory saying oh i know there's a patent that's out there and i got a design around that and I always advise if you're in the laboratory it's important to get your invention to work do not worry about patents initially get find the best way to do whatever you got to do there are solutions that can be worked out either through licenses or acquisitions you know there are financial things that can can help the IP issues in terms of freedom to operate down the road the most important thing is to work out the technology so that it works and it makes commercial sense that is you know you may have a great solution to a problem but it it it makes no commercial sense whatsoever it's just going to be too darn expensive for anyone to move it forward so I thought I advised at the early stages is is IPS is it's very important but it's far more important to know investor is going to invest in a company with 35 pounds if the technology doesn't work it's him you know you've got to start with getting the technology to work getting it done in a in a way that is cost-effective then we can deal with the patent you know issues down the road so focus on the technology first understand these trade secret and patent issues but what you do get something to work once you do see something that really seems to be doing well in the laboratory and seems to make sense that's the time to start thinking about trade secrets and patents and have those discussions but not until that time great that makes a lot of sense what about so maybe I guess so now we take a hypothetical where someone they've got something that's starting to work they think it's time to start developing the patent and then they're trying to think about balancing where to pat you know and maybe maybe that would in part maybe your answer hinges upon you know is there a business plan looking at international markets is it primarily domestic but are other ways to kind of think about the trade-offs between the cost of maintaining a portfolio an international portfolio and and maybe where that is a good idea where it is it sure it's some again it's back to the business strategy is very important where are the markets for whatever the product is that you want to sell then you have to come back and it's sort of an iterative process so so you start with a business strategy my three biggest marques or five biggest markets are in the following countries then you have to come back and say okay what is my invention is my invention patentable or protectable in those five markets and it may be that it's it's not and then so you have to evaluate all right so what if that's my big mark of what is it that I can do what's her protection that I can get in those areas one of the things we haven't even talked about is trademarks trademarks are a way by which you can protect your your your business in a broad sense so that you i dint you are identified as the source of whatever it is the method the technique the device that you're selling and that's additional protection that you can get in a country where you just may not be able to get patent protection for something and then it's a it's a cost-benefit analysis you know we prepare estimates all the time but this is what it's going to cost to file in those particular regions and you have to balance you have to decide okay here's the protection i could get versus the you know what's the value of that protection and how much it's going to cost great well Michael really appreciate your time today this has been a great presentation and on behalf of rpe thank you for sharing your sauce and I know that you know you've got your information here people have additional questions and we'll have this slides up soon so
