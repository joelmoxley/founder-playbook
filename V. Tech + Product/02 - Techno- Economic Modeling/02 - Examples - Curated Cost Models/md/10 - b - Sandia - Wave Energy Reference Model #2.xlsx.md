Cost Estimating Notes:											
1.6	Subsystem Integration and Profit margins are difficult to estimate given the level of design of the reference model.  For consistency and to make it simple, this was assumed to be 10% of the machine cost.  This is probably low for single unit production scale										
	However, because the primary focus of the RM effort is in identifying cost reduction pathways it was decided to apply this assumption, rather then an assumption as a function of deployment scale.  										
	In reality, a figure closer to 30% is probably more realistic at single unit scale.

1.8 Decomissioning	
	
Cost Estimating Notes	
1.8	Decomissioning costs are assumed to be the same as the installation costs, because similar operational procedures will be used to remove the plant hardware as for the installation process.  The key difference is that decomissioning
	occurs at the end of the 20-year project life, having a minimal impact on the cost of electricty from this plant.  Decomissioning costs are not represented in the CoE assessment.

1.9 Contingency		
		
Cost Estimating Notes		
1.9	Contingency captures unknown unknowns.  Given the conceptual level of design, it is likely that quite a few items are not well understood and hence costs are under-predicted.   	
	10% is used because that is what offshore wind has been using.

	100 - Units	0.50%	Note: Typical in Onshore Wind, assuming high technical maturity				
							
Cost Estimating Notes							
2.1	Insurance cost is a direct function of the perceived risk of a project.  Offshore Oil & Gas project are typically on the order of 2% of CAPEX.  These are one-off construction projects with a relatively high risk profile (oil-spill potential etc.). 						
	 On the other end of the spectrum is land-based wind that is technologically mature with typical insurance rates on the order of 0.5%.  The assumption is that for 1 and 10-unit deployment scales technology is relatively immature						
	It is also assumed that no investor will take the risk of building a 100-unit farm unless technology risks are perceived as being really small.
