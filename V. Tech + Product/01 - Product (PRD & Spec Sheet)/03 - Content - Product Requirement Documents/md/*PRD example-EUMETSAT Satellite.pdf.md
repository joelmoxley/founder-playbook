“Superseded” Products or software packages that have been (pre-) operationally provided to users but are not (pre-) operational anymore because the information of same or superior quality and/or coverage is provided with another product and considered by the relevant Steering Group as not useful for being produced. Note, the “superseded” products remain available for the users. 

“Discontinued” Products or software packages that have been previously (pre-) operationally provided to users but are not (pre-) operational anymore and are considered by the relevant Steering Group as not useful for further production. Note, the “discontinued” products remain available for the users.  

“Deleted” Products or software packages that have been previously planned or (pre-) operationally provided to users but are not planned or (pre-) operational anymore and are considered by the relevant Steering Group as not useful to be provided to users. 


1.4. Uncertainty characterisation 

The CM SAF applies the following accuracy concept for its data set using three different metrics: 

Mean error, Precision and Stability.  

These are defined as follows: 

Mean error: This measure should tell how close the parameter estimation is on average to a reference observation (representing the truth). The quantity is often referred to as the bias but for some applications the mean of the absolute error is more appropriate. The definition of the truth depends on the variable and the availability of references.  

Precision : This measure should tell how individual parameter estimations are distributed relative to the mean error. The quantity used is the standard deviation of the error which is equivalent to the bias-corrected RMS error. 

Stability : This measure should tell whether one or several accuracy metrics are stable or if they are changing over time. The CM SAF has chosen to monitor only the first metric here (the mean error) where criteria have been defined for the maximum changes being acceptable per decade for each product.

5. Targeted User Communities 
This section shortly described the three main targeted application areas of CM SAF and outlines a few key indicators of each of these areas.  

5.1. Global and regional climate studies 
Satellite data has the potential to monitor a variety of key atmospheric variables to infer long term changes in the global and regional climate and also attempt to attribute the cause of the observed changes. For application for climate monitoring the data sets need to span at least several decades in order to be able to monitor climate change. Some satellite data sets already approach 30 years in length However, though continually expanding, many data sets are still shorter than 20 years. Climate monitoring implies the most stringent requirements for satellite data to be applied, both in terms of stability of the measurement and in the minimum time period of the dataset. . GCOS specifies the requirements needed for climate monitoring (GCOS-154, 2011)  

Global and regional atmospheric and ocean reanalyses are now being undertaken in a number of centres and are being increasingly used for climate applications. A key requirement for the data to be assimilated into these reanalyses is that they are uniformly processed without the discontinuities often seen in operational real time processed data sets caused by changes to operational processing of the instrument data. There are also stringent requirements on the stability of the measurements for long term climate monitoring. 

For this application area and user group, it is expected that the CM SAF should meet mostly the “optimal accuracies”.  

5.2. Global and regional climate modelling 

Data sets of surface and top-of-the-atmosphere radiation budget, water vapour and temperature distribution, as well as data sets of cloud properties (e.g. fractional cover, top height, phase, microphysical properties etc.) provide an important constraint for climate models. Regional estimates of all these parameters are important for detection and attribution studies. A high temporal resolution of the observations to resolve the diurnal cycle of these parameters is important to analyse the underlying physical processes.  

Regional climate modelling centres use satellite observations to evaluate regional coupled atmosphere ocean models.  

The requirements on temporal stability of the satellite data sets for model evaluation are less stringent than for climate monitoring and analyses. The requirements on accuracy depend on the magnitude of the model error to be assessed. The time series required for these studies are typically for only a few years, although often specific periods of interest (e.g. El Nino and La Nina, major volcanic eruption etc.) are required.  

The requirements for regional climate models evaluation are essentially the same as for global models with an increased requirement in terms of spatial and temporal sampling. Often data sets for specific periods of meteorological interest or coincident with major field campaigns will define the time periods. Mostly these field campaigns have a specific focus on processes (e.g. cloud interaction) in the climate systems and used to improve model parameterisations. 

To serve this specific requirement it is therefore important to use the most recent and sophisticated satellite systems that are available as input for the generation of data sets. It is required for the model evaluation that the satellite data records are homogenized and are based on an inter-calibrated underlying satellite radiance record. Additionally, a specific requirement on satellite estimates of variables is that the retrieval scheme applied to satellite radiances should be as independent as possible from external NWP model input to avoid circular reasoning. 

For this application area and user group, it is expected that the CM SAF should meet mostly the “target accuracies”.  

5.3. Operational monitoring and infrastructure planning 

Operational monitoring is defined as a continuum of provision, delivery and consumption of climate information and products. Operational monitoring should have the properties of being available, dependable, usable, credible, responsive, flexible and sustainable.  

In contrast to the above described target areas, this area is covering the need of NMHSs to receive satellite based climate information in short- and medium-term latency in order to provide climate services to its users. This could be e.g. provision of maps with anomalies and extremes observed in the last months or year. Taking a long-term climatology as basis for this application are the requirements is on one hand on timeliness and on the other hand on consistency (e.g. for input data, algorithms). 

In summary, Table 5-1 presents the anticipated accuracies for the different CM SAF target users. However, it is noted that there certainly exists less stringent requirements for some applications.

6. Convention on CM SAF ID Numbering for CDOP 2 
With start of CDOP 2 CM SAF  uses for all new entries a  
* four digit numbering system for all of products provided to the user in short time latency. 
* five digit numbering system for all climate data sets. 

The CM SAF identifiers from CDOP remain unchanged and have been integrated into this document from [AD-2]. The new scheme is flexible enough to integrate upcoming products and data sets in a coherent way. Also in principle, all existing entries from CDOP can be transferred into the new scheme. 

The four digit numbering system for the short time latency CM SAF products is as follows: Digit #1 shows the operational satellite instrument family i.e. 5XXr for MSG based product, 6XXr for AVHRR based products.

The next two digits (#2,#3) describe the major physical groups (e.g. clouds) and the individual parameter within a group. For details see Table 6-2, Table 6-3, Table 6-4, and Table 6-5. The last digit is for all operational CM SAF products in this category 0 (r=0).

The five digit numbering system  for CM SAF data sets follows in principle the same rules as described above for CM SAF products. 

The leading digit of the five numbering system describes the satellite instrument family, starting with 1 for polar satellite system, 2 for geostationary system (see Table 6-1). 

The 2nd digit represents then the instrument(s) category used for the data set, as presented in Table 6-1. The next two digits represent the physical group and the individual parameter (see Table 6-2, Table 6-3, Table 6-4, and Table 6-5). This is followed by the last digit ‘r’ of the CM SAF identifier distinguishing between different releases of this parameter.

DEM from SRTM where available and GEOTOPO30 
elsewhere. Dynamic aerosol correction is foreseen to 
be implemented based on indirect estimation of AOD 
at 550 nm from UV-band satellite measurements of 
the atmosphere. Detailed descriptions will be made

the uncertainty might be increased.

Comments 
The dataset contains existing unchanged elements from 
CM-150 (SSM/I) and CM-12001 (SSMIS). Additionally 
processed data: SSMIS temporal extension and 
SMMR full period with unchanged baseline algorithm. 
Verification might not cover full period. 
Consistency is given as the total uncertainty of global 
monthly means for differences to the selected 
reference. 
The SSM/I like FCDR also covers land areas. However, 
the viewing angle correction is not applied over land, 
and due to likely larger temperature ranges the 
uncertainty might be increased over land. 
SMMR quality might be reduced.

Methods 
The data set will be the Jacobian weighted upper 
tropospheric relative humidity roughly in the 
layer between 500 and 200 hPa which is derived 
from the radiances as described in Buehler and 
John (2005). It will be compared with the same 
quantity from model fields using a satellite 
simulator approach (e.g., COSP). Daily mean - 
ascending and descending passes separated 
data will be provided.

Comparison with in-situ measurements. Only a few reliable 
operational in-situ measurements are available in Africa. The 
target accuracy is based on the comparison at available 
stations and is not necessarily valid everywhere in Africa. 
However, it is not expected that the quality is greatly reduced 
over Africa.

10. Traceability of Requirements 
This section gives additional information on the traceability of requirements beyond the text in 
the table of section 8. 
10.1. CM-141 (Near surface specific humidity) 
Bias and RMS product requirements are taken from WMO GCOS (2010) for “specific humidity 
profile – lower troposphere” and Saunders et al. (2010) for “water vapour profiles – lower 
troposphere (climate research)”. 
For the requirement on decadal stability the following is considered: The functional relationship 
between saturation water vapour pressure and temperature expressed by the Clausius- 
Clapeyron equation leads to the expectation that specific humidity will increase by 7% per 1K 
increase of the global mean temperature. The IPCC AR-4 climate models give a range of 1.4 to 
5.8 K (with a mean of 0.36 K) warming over the 21st century (Meehl et al., 2007). Transforming 
this with Clausius-Clapeyron to an increase of specific humidity, we arrive at some 2.52% 
increase per decade. The target and threshold product requirements are then determined by 
multiplying the expected water vapour change per change in temperature with the average and 
maximum expected temperature change and a factor of 0.2 as proposed in Ohring et al. (2005). 
Finally, the threshold product requirement is rounded. 
10.2. CM-142 (Surface wind speed) 
Bias product requirements are taken from WMO GCOS (2010). The RMS optimum and 
threshold product requirements are taken from JCOMM TR (2002). It is argued in JCOMM TR 
(2003) that in order to reach requirements on heat fluxes wind speed must be known with an 
accuracy of 0.5 m/s which is a “stringent requirement” and not expected to be met. The 
threshold RMS is the maximum RMS from their Table 1. The target RMS product requirement is 
a requirement for scatterometers (Dickinson et al., 2001 and Gelsthorpe et al., 2000). The 
optimum and target stability product requirement are determined by taking the trend values 
given in Thomas et al. (2008) and applying a factor of 0.2 (Ohring et al., 2005) and from GCOS- 
107, respectively. The threshold stability product requirement is determined by multiplying the 
target requirement with a factor of 2. Note that the GCOS-107 target stability requirement for 
upper air wind is 2 m/s. 
10.3. CM-143 (Latent heat flux) 
The optimum bias product requirement (LHF) is taken from Curry et al. (2004). The target and 
threshold bias product requirement are determined by wind and near surface specific humidity 
error propagation through the bulk aerodynamic formula – the target is defined by the maximum 
impact of the individual biases and the threshold by the sum of both impacts. The RMS optimum 
product requirement (LHF) is taken from JCOMM TR (2002). The RMS target and threshold 
product requirements are determined by applying a Student`s t-test using the bias product 
requirements and t values tabulated in von Storch and Zwiers (1999). Note that this approach 
would result in an optimum requirement of 11 W/m what is very similar to the requirement given 
2 
in JCOMM TR (2002). Roads et al. (2007) provides annual RMS values for the Water and 
Energy Budget Study variables, among them latent heat flux. An appropriate scaling of the 
annual RMS value results in an RMS=22.5 W/m . This is between the target and threshold 
2 
product requirement. The optimum and target stability product requirements are determined

based on trend estimates given in Yu and Weller (2007) and applying the Ohring et al. (2005) 
approach. The threshold stability requirement is estimated through error propagation from 
evaporation (see section 10.5 for user requirements related to evaporation). 
10.4. CM-144 (Precipitation) 
Bias product requirements are taken from WMO GCOS (2010), scaled to change units and 
rounded (from 0.08 to 0.1 mm/d and from 0.24 to 0.25 mm/d). The RMS product requirement are 
determined by applying a Student`s t-test using the bias product requirements and t values 
tabulated in von Storch and Zwiers (1999). Roads et al. (2007) provided annual RMS values for 
the Water and Energy Budget Study variables, among them precipitation. An appropriate scaling 
of the annual RMS value results in an RMS=2.28 mm/d. This is slightly larger than our threshold 
product requirement. The optimum stability product requirement is taken from Ohring et al. 
(2005), again scaled to change units. The target stability product requirement is estimated by 
using the requirement given in GCOS-107 and an average global precipitation of 2.83 mm/d 
(Meehl et al., 2007). The threshold stability product requirement is determined by multiplying the 
target requirement with a factor of 2. Wentz et al. (2007) found that precipitation will increase by 
7.4% per 1K increase of the global mean temperature. Transforming this as outlined for near 
surface specific humidity gives a requirement of 0.024 mm/d/decade which is similar to the 
product requirement. 
10.5. CM-145 (Evaporation) 
The bias product requirements for evaporation are determined from LHF requirements by 
applying error propagation. The RMS product requirements are determined by applying a 
Student`s t-test as outlined above. Roads et al. (2007) provides annual RMS values for the 
Water and Energy Budget Study variables, among them evaporation. An appropriate scaling of 
the annual RMS value results in an RMS=0.76 mm/d. This is between the target and threshold 
product requirement. The optimum and target product requirement is identical to the 
corresponding precipitation requirement. The threshold is estimated from trend estimates given 
in Röckner et al. (2001) applying the Ohring et al. (2005) approach. Held and Soden (2006) state 
that evaporation might increase by 2% per 1K increase of the global mean temperature. 
Transforming this as outlined for near surface specific humidity gives a requirement of 0.006 to 
0.009 mm/d/decade which is similar to the given product requirements. 
10.6. CM-146 (E-P (freshwater flux)) 
The bias and stability product requirements for the freshwater flux are taken from precipitation 
and evaporation: for the optimum the minimum, for the target the maximum and for the threshold 
the sum of both requirements are used. Held and Soden (2006) derive an equation which links 
evaporation, precipitation and freshwater fluxes. Applying their equation and further proceed as 
outlined for near surface specific humidity gives a requirement of 0.006 mm/d/decade which is 
similar to the given product requirements. The RMS product requirements are determined by 
applying a Student`s t-test as outlined above. 
10.7. CM-150 (SSM/I FCDR) 
The optimum and target as well as threshold product requirements are taken from MRD (2010) 
and Ohring et al. (2005), respectively. The optimum RMS product requirement is identical to the 
strongest noise requirements given in EPS-SG UR (2011). The average RMS in Table 2 in 
Amerault and Zou (2003) defines the target and the combined maximum RMS for SSM/I and the 
radiative transfer model, also given in Amerault and Zou (2003) the threshold product

requirement. The optimum and target threshold product requirements are taken from Ohring et 
al. (2005). The threshold stability product requirement is determined by multiplying the target 
requirement with a factor of 2.
