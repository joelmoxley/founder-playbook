1. Introduction 

1.1. Document Objective 
The Market Requirements Document (MRD) focuses on describing the market problem, market opportunity, and the resulting market requirements that help design a solution that addresses the market problem and realizes the market opportunity. 
<Comment: This document is presented to Engineering for solution planning and design.> 

1.2. Executive Summary 
<Write the executive summary. Provide a concise report of the pertinent facts, assumptions, and suggestions noted throughout this document.> 
<Comment: This section is the last section to be filled in and is to be done once the MRD is complete. Focus on the key elements in each document section and do not exceed two pages.  The executive summary is a miniature version of the entire document.> 

2. Market Problem and Opportunity 

2.1. Section Objective 
This section describes the market problem and resulting market opportunity. 

2.2. Market Problem 
<Identify and justify the specific market problem.  Explain any other interlinking market problems.> 
<Comment: The market problem is a "consumer" or "product" or "technology" problem in the target market.  The market problem is essentially a situation (difficulty) that exists in the target market and requires change. 
* Consumer Problem – A marketplace situation in which consumer needs remain unsatisfied (B2C).  The solution to a consumer problem is a whole product. 
* Product Problem – An industry situation in which product requirements are unmet (B2B).  The solution to a product problem is a product component. 
* Technology Problem – Challenges in applied science. The solution to a technology problem is scientific research. 

2.3. 
Market Opportunity 
<Provide a statement detailing the specific market opportunity. Size and substantiate the market opportunity as much as possible. Document the assumptions and facts that validate and justify the market opportunity. Explain any other interlinking market opportunities.> 
<Comment: The market opportunity is a lucrative, lasting, and sizable market problem.  Market Opportunity = Market Problem + Volume + Duration + Earning Potential.>
