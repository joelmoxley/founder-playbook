KTA38-G5 Diesel Generator

 

Description
The KTA38-Series benefits from years of technical development and improvement to bring customers an innovative and future proof diesel engine that keeps pace with ever changing generator set requirements. 
Recognized globally for its performance under even the most severe climatic conditions, the KTA38-Series is widely acknowledged as the most robust and cost effective diesel engine in its power range for the generator set market
Features
Aftercooler: Large capacity after cooler results in cooler, denser intake air for more efficient combustion and reduced internal stresses for longer life. 
Fuel System: Cummins exclusive low pressure PT™ system with wear compensating pump and integral dual flyweight governor. Camshaft actuated fuel injectors give accurate metering and timing. Fuel lines are internal drilled passages in cylinder heads. Spin-on fuel filter. 
Cooling System: Gear driven centrifugal water pump. Large volume water passages provide even flow of coolant around cylinder liners, valves and injectors. Bypass thermostats regulate coolant temperature. Spin-on corrosion resistors check rust and corrosion, control acidity and remove Impurities. 
Cylinder Block: Alloy cast iron with removable wet liners. Cross bolt support to main bearing cap provides extra strength and stability. 
Turbocharger: Cummins Turbo Technologies (CTT) exhaust gas driven turbocharger mounted at top of engine provides more power, improved fuel economy, altitude compensation, and lower smoke and noise levels.
