STATEMENT OF WORK
Know-How transfer: Review of licensee GaN μLED fabrication process flow
Overview
LICENSOR will conduct a review of the process flow as developed by Licensee for fabrication of GaN chiplet LEDs. During the review, and starting immediately upon signature, LICENSOR will continuously identify process areas and topics ripe for improvement and transfer existing process know-how to licensee in order to allow for rapid addressing of suboptimal processes. We expect there to be areas where immediate improvements can be made and where LICENSOR can make recommendations within days of signature and that new potential improvements will be identified throughout the engagement.

Initial information gathering and analysis (week 1-3)
The engagement will begin with an on-site review at Licensee for an in­depth introduction to the flow process that will include the out-sourcing arrangements and specifications as well as the fabrication sequence, test results, and an enumeration of the perceived programmatic/technical issues. The initial engagement may include visits to suppliers of out-sourced fabrication steps (e.g., Teledyne) and may include materials and device characterization at LICENSOR. During this, and proceeding sessions, meetings with licensee suppliers, including Teledyne, may be scheduled to improve information gathering and process improvement quality.

Interim Report (week 6)
Based on the analysis, the LICENSOR team will prepare and submit a report evaluating the existing process flow and identifying areas that are prime candidates to improve device performance or yield on the short term, for review by Licensee. Note that this report is likely to contain little new information; as improvement areas are identified they will be immediately communicated to Licensee.

Meeting to Refine activities (week 7)
* Discuss the report conclusions
* Achieve consensus between LICENSOR and LICENCEE in the key problem areas to be addressed
* LICENSOR and Nth working together will develop a plan to realize the proposed improvements.

Detailed plan (week 10)
Based on these discussions, LICENSOR will develop technology options and create a plan for further development and implementation of solutions.

Final report and meeting (week 12)
This will include recommendations for follow-on experimental work and trial runs that can be conducted at LICENSOR for materials characterization, modeling, and processing.
