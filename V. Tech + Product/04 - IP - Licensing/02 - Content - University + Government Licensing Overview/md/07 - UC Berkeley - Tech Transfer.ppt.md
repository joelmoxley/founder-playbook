 UC Berkeley Innovation Commercialization
 06/17/2017


Agenda:  5-10 Minutes
1. How Innovations Get Commercialized: the 4Ms
2. How UC Berkeley Leverages IP to Catalyze Commercialization
3. How Teams Can Obtain IP Rights to UC Berkeley Innovations


UC Berkeley IPIRA
Research to Determine How University Innovations Get Commercialized
* How do university innovations get commercialized?
      * What catalyzed the commercialization?
      * How is university involved in the process?
* Researched over 50 UC Berkeley spin-outs
      * Spin-out profiles formed 4 clusters / patterns
      * Developed a useful (but simplified) framework…



Commercializing: 4 Pathways for Univ Tech
High
Low
Pull The extent that companies drive the transition from  research to product
Push  The extent that universities drive the transition from research to product
Milked 
Systematically out of research by corporate collaborators
Mined
Opportunistically by entrepreneurs (e.g. MBA students) that periodically scour campus 
Morphed
Organically out of research by team member(s)
Marketed
Methodically to industry by campus (e.g. PI, PR, IPMO, etc)



Commercialization: Morphed, Mined, Milked, Marketed
Morphed
Organically out of research by team member(s)

* Examples: Amyris, Calimetrics, CaliSolar, CellASIC, Chiron, Excellin, Fluxion Biosystems, GoodGuide (TaoIt), Harmonic Devices, Inktomi, Integrated Diag, IntelliOne, Kalinex, Lumiphore, Mercator Med (EndoBionics), MicroClimates (Aptility), MicroFluiDX, OnWafer, ON Diagnostics, PhotoSwitch Bioscience, Redwood Bioscience, SiClocks, TheraFuse, Urban Scan, Verimetra Med, Wireless Industrial Tech, Dust Networks, Iris AO, SiTime
* Drivers: 
    * Great Research
    * Entrepreneurial culture & eco-system
* IP:  
    * Some obtain exclusive license to improve biz plan & attract investors
    * Some ignore or abscond with IP



Commercialization: Morphed, Mined, Milked, Marketed
Mined Opportunistically by entrepreneurs  (e.g. MBA students) that periodically scour campus 
* Examples:  Adura Tech, Aurora Biofuels, CommandCAD, Euclid Media, MediFuel, NanoRay, nanoPrint 
* Drivers:  
    * Great Research
    * MBAs, Biz plan comp, OTL mrktg
* IP:  
    * Many obtain exclusive license to improve biz plan & attract investors 
    * Some ignore or abscond with IP
* Comments:  
    * Pathway with highest growth rate
    * MBAs are the campus’s EIRs



Commercialization: Morphed, Mined, Milked, Marketed
Milked
Systematically out of research by corporate research sponsor
* Examples (that licensed IP):  Analog Devices, Ecoprene (XL Tech), Google, Honeywell, Intel, Berkeley Bionics (first morphed then milked)
* Drivers:  
    * Great sponsored research with optimized terms (i.e. 1st access, NERF, open source, etc)
    * Off-campus corporate labs (i.e. BWRC, Intel, Cadence, Yahoo, Starkey, etc)
* IP:  
    * Some jointly own IP
    * Some obtain a license to legally use IP or thwart competitors
    * Some ignore or abscond with IP




Commercialization: Morphed, Mined, Milked, Marketed
Marketed
Methodically to industry by campus faculty & staff (e.g. PI, PR, OTL)
* Examples:  Arkal Medical, Cisco, ClimateCooler, FuelFX, Luminus Devices, Honeywell, Microchip Biotech, Renovis, Silicon Basis, Solexel, Vitesse, 3M 
* Drivers:  
    * Great Research
    * Marketing (i.e. IP Licensing offices, University PR programs, Faculty pubs & ppts, Patent pubs, etc)
* IP:  
    * Most obtain exclusive license to stay legal, improve BP, attract investment, or thwart competitors
    * Some ignore IP or abscond with IP
* Comments:  Didn’t get morphed, milked or mined because tech or market too nascent when invented




Commercializing: Pathways, IP & Know-How
Importance of UC Berkeley IP Rights (i.e. exclusive license)
Importance of UC Berkeley Know-How (i.e. faculty consulting & student hiring)
* Morphed commercialization, by definition, depends on UCB know-how, that is sometimes augmented with UCB IP
* Marketed commercialization usually involves UCB IP but frequently not UCB know-how
* Milked commercialization can involve the least amount (and sometimes no) UCB IP or know-how
* Mined commercialization usually involves a mix of UCB IP & know-how



Leveraging IP:  Segmenting Innovations
Potential Return on Investment
Risk of Investment Required to Try to Commercialize Technology
* Note that some technologies can be applied to multiple markets that each have their own risk/return profile



Leveraging IP:  Catalyzing Applications 
Potential Return on Investment
Risk of Investment Required to Try to Commercialize Technology

License to REWARD RESEARCHERS
* Can motivate researchers to continue innovating
* Exclusive or non-exclusive with or without field-of-use demarcations

License to REMOVE RESTRAINTS
* Non-exclusive, royalty free
* Public domain
* Open software

License to RAISE RETURNS
* Improve biz plan & attract investment
* Power to exclude competitors
* Freedom to operate without infringement 



Leveraging IP: Examples* of UCB Licensing
Potential Return on Investment
* These are approximate placements

Risk of Investment Required to Try to Commercialize Technology
?Gecko-Nano Adhesives?
LED Lighting (Luminus)
3D Images for Mapping (Google, Urban Scan)
Carbon Calculator (ClimateCooler)
Molecular Design (Caveat)
Energy Scavenging (Medifuel)
Clean Energy Model (FuelFX)
Demand Response (MicroClimates)
UNIX (Sun)
Web Search (Inktomi)
Medical Devices (Arkal Med, Mercator Med, NanoRay, OND)
Electronic Design (CommandCAD)
Car Traffic Info (Intellione)
?IR Sensors?
RF MEMS (HD, SiClocks)
Product DB (GoodGuide/TaoIt)
Video Branding (Euclid Media)
Exoskeletons (Berkeley Bionics)




Licensing:  Common Steps*
* Objectives:  commercialize IP broadly, quickly, beneficially
* Challenges  
      * Manage uncertainty & risk of commercial success 
      * Understand & reconcile different perspectives (corps, inventors, univ)
* Approach  
      * Entrepreneurial (flexible, creative)
      * Principled (win-win)
      * Transparent (no conflicts of interests)
* Process:  Incremental

Market IP
Evaluate Opportunity
Letter Agreement
Option Agreement
License Agreement
Common Steps (*simplified)



Licensing:  Managing Risk 
Risks decrease as technology is developed into products



Licensing:  Commitment = f (Risk)
Partner Commitment
Commitment incrementally increases as risk decreases

 * Issue Fee (& equity)
 * Earned Royalties
 * Min Annual Royalties
 * Indemnification
 * + below

 * Annual Fee
 * Diligence Terms
 * + below

 * Comm Plan
 * Patent Costs
 * + below

 * Confidential
 * Agreement



Licensing:  Complexity
Relationship Complexity
Complexity incrementally increases as commitments increase & risks decrease

* 30-Page Doc
* Patent Life is Term
* If no extraordinary issues, then can be completed in 30-90 days

* 10-Page Doc
* 1-2 Year Term
* If no extraordinary issues, then can be completed in 30-60 days

* 2-Page Doc
* 3-6 Month Term
* If no extraordinary issues, then can be completed within 30 days

* 1-Page Doc




Summary
* Key points 
    * 4M university pathways: morphed, mined, milked, marketed
    * Leverage IP rights to catalyze commercialization
    * IP rights agreements can be multi-step process
