This introduction to licensing from ARPA-E University takes entrepreneurs through the basics licensing your technology to an external party. 

Dr. Edmonds reviews the impact of the America Invents Act on licensing, what to expect in a license agreement and their typical monetary terms, and how to meet the licensing needs of start-ups and academics. This session builds on the Energy Innovation and IP Strategy session of ARPA-E University that was held in December 2012 (http://youtu.be/bpSWsa_Qv3Q).

ARPA-E University: Technology-to-Market: Licensing 101 with Dr. Karina Edmonds

hello and welcome everyone to arpa.e university we're pleased to start today's presentation and just so use those of you who are new to RP University giving let me give you some background RB University is a series of webinars designed to assess the energy technology  community in advancing innovations that can dramatically improve how we generate store and use energy originally arpa e University was focused exclusively on technology to market topics like cost modeling finance and business models now we're looking to build upon that  foundation and expand RP university to include technical webinars and office hours just last week we hosted the first RPG university office our  session which was a 30-minute live Q&A with an RPG program director in the months ahead please look for these new types of arpa e University sessions we look forward to your feedback today today's edition is an RP University focused on a technology to market topic which   is licensing this session builds upon an energy innovation and IP strategy session of RP universities it was held in December 2012 and a recording of that webinar is available on our website likewise a recording of today's webinar and a copy of the slides will be available within a week on the RP website now I'd like to introduce today's speaker dr. Kareem Edmonds dr. Edmonds has has over 15 years of experience working with the private sector universities and national laboratories across the country in the innovation space she's do E's first full-time technology transfer coordinator and previously served as the director of Technology Transfer for JPL she's a registered patent agent at USPTO and earned her bachelor's and mechanical engineering from the University of Rhode Island and masters and PhD and Aeronautics in the California Institute of Technology Karina thank you for joining us today Thank You Adam and thank you for one out there joining us today I'm very excited to have an opportunity to speak with you all especially as I end my tenure here at the department of energy just to give you what's the first slide just to give you an overview of the topics that I'll be discussing today they include the types of intellectual property a little bit on American Invents Act just a little background touch upon by DOE and and and then we'll move right into the topic of interest today which will be licensing and licensing agreements also I should mention that I'd like to leave some you know ample time at the end of the presentation to field your questions and  answer those those for you then I'll move on to the process of licensing give you examples of some typical monetary terms and time to execution and then focus on the needs of startups and small businesses who I expect are the larger majority of my audience today and then the type of support that you can expect from your tech transfer office and then how do you overcome barriers should should you face those so with that we'll move right in I'll skip over that first slide as Adam has done a great job introducing me and also I'm not going to go down the list of all the different types of intellectual property because I saw that mr. Michael Ward who presented previously given excellent presentation on all the different types of intellectual property but I thought it would be important to at least note the difference between trade secrets and patents as this is a topic that is of interest to individual inventors and smaller companies because of the cost savings that you may achieve using a trade secret versus a pen and so again just wanted to highlight some of these as you all know that trade secrets can be used in business and give an opportunity to obtain economic advantage over competitor who may not know or use it it's important to know that so a couple of advantages of trade secret obviously you would use a trade secret in the case where your trade secret would not be easily discovered cannot be reverse engineered also the invention is not patentable some of the advantages are that the term is unlimited so long as it you keep that a secret and that there is no registration see for these trade secrets the difference here with a patent is that you do obviously pay for patent costs and you would want to use that in case in the case where your product could be reverse engineer and that there is a 20-year term from the time of filing for pad so and obviously with with patent protection that in Lima eliminates the need for you to try to maintain secrecy which could be difficult and depending on business consideration and you know you would want to weigh in in terms of which way to go the next slide I will be just talking about some of the differences here that have recently been enacted with the American Invents Act and that for those that don't know we have now gone to a first-to-file system in the past the US was one of maybe two countries in the world who had first to invent so if you could show that you were the first inventor you had a shot arguing for the patent but now we've moved to a first-to-file system and some of the differences are with the grace period there's a lot of concern that the new grace period could hurt inventors in the case where so the grace period is typically a one year time carriers that you have between a public disclosure and filing for patent applications and with this new grace period folks are concerns because if you presented your invention and somebody in you and you are not filing for provisional and within that one year period somebody else derives your invention independently you could be barred from getting year from obtaining a patent so your your disclosure does not count against you as prior art but somebody else is May and so to be safe I would really recommend at this time that you would file at least a provisional patent which a few years ago was about a hundred two hundred and fifty dollars to file I don't imagine it's much more than hat and at least you have your your filing date saved some advantages of American Invents Act are this new micro entity status and I have a slide that describes of the qualifications for that and I'll let you decide whether you qualify or not but if you do you have a significant cost saving of seventy-five percent on most patent fees on the qualify and the other change is the third party prior art submission so in the past you pretty much had to wait till the patent was issued to start the process of showing you know prior are as an individual or independent inventor and in this case during the patent filing you have an opportunity to submit prior art against a competitor's patent 7:36 filing so that's that's where that comes in so let's see the next slide just shows those those filing fees that you're saving so the bottom line is here you effectively saying twenty-five percent of these fees which is quite a saving so I won't go through that and then again this this slide just talks about how do you qualify them as a micro entity and I won't go through all the different qualifications as it's going to be individual and I should also mention that to support a single individual inventors and small companies the US Patent Office is opening up satellite locations across the country that will be offering free technical assistance and even some assistance in writing your patents and I don't have the list of those but hopefully we can list those and they may already be listed on the rpd website but that's definitely something that would be useful to you to have what is the closest satellite office that can help you answer questions because there are a lot of changes that will be taking place ok so again we're going to skip over icro entity just a little background again is not knowing the makeup of the audience it's important to note what enable the whole field of technology transfer and that would be the bayh-dole legislation in the early 1980s which in a nutshell says that universities and nonprofits can retain title to us funded to federally funded technologies and there are some exceptions and there are some reporting and compliance requirements that I would definitely like to bring to your attention because you know large universities and larger entities usually have an you know a compliance person or whole compliance Department which is not typically the case with smaller companies and this is very important because if you do not report these inventions and comply you or you run the risk of losing out on those inventions and it has happened in the past and we see that at the department of energy as well like I said I mentioned what that and universities do have a responsibility of commercializing and having some due diligence in exchange the government does get a royalty-free paid-up license to any to any inventions that are developed under their funding and the bayh-dole legislation also requires that universities and nonprofits share royalties with the inventors and the legislation requires a minimum of fifteen percent most universities and nonprofits typically provide twenty-five to thirty percent and within the goe I've seen anywhere from 15 to 50 percent so and again and the revenues the other part of that revenue needs to go back to for research and education purposes as well another caveat is that these patents cannot be assigned except to a patent management organization in that case they don't need permission if they're going to assign it to another to a company that the university or non-profit can request permission from the funding agency to assign it typically it doesn't happen that often and in my three years here goe I've seen maybe two assignments and the reason it's not needed because just providing a company the exclusive license for the life of the patent is defective effectively an assignment so it's you know it's in my 15 years of licensing I never had an issue because companies understand the requirement and they also are happy with an exclusive license for the life of the patent so not an issue but something that you should know so if you ask a university or this nonprofit that you like a patent assignment and they provide some pushback you know why and they typically will let you know that but that's part of the legislation okay so getting to the bulk of the presentation here what is the license and you know just like a this is covered but it's also i'm going to know a patent some people believe a patent is the right to practice an invention and it's actually not a patent gives you the right to exclude others which is a very important right and so  with a license which is an enforceable contract the license or ways it's right to exclude the licensee to make you sell that patented invention in exchange for consideration so the license can take on many forms and we'll discuss in the upcoming slides but it can be exclusive it could be non-exclusive it could be partially exclusive limited either by time or field or it could be limited to two or three licensees so there's a number of ways to provide why deployment for that technology let's see n also that the patent or the invention that has not been granted can't be a patent I'm sorry so this license that you're creating can be for patent it could be for software copyright know how or combination of those and it's important to know that you are able to license before the patent is issued as soon as you file for patent protection you're able to to license that invention okay so on the next slide Todd starts to talk about the process for obtaining a license and again here I am assuming that you now have a time that is has been filed some copyright trademark on even when I again talking about trademark but that could be a likeness or trademark as well the first step in any licensing prot a prop for any licensing would be to identify the intellectual property that you are interested in obtaining and it's also important to know that it's typically not just one patent it will be a family of patent and if you're lucky they're all at the same institution but most most often they may not they may not be and so you'd have to obtain a license from multiple universities or multiple entities a university in a small company or university in a lab and that is increasingly the case where you know you have collaboration from multiple institutions you will be required to provide a business plan typically with some kind of market projection for that technology or the this other market that you are planning to pursue they'll verify the company or the individual has the resources to commercialize and so including the business team is important  let's see and it doesn't necessarily have to be a company so often you individual can get a license but sometimes the the University of that nonprofit entity may require that you incorporate before negotiating a license but it's definitely not necessary at that point once you once you presented your business plan identify actually the first step is once you identify the technology that intellectual property the university or again a license or will let you know is that intellectual property is indeed available for licensing and also what fields of views are available for like sensing so I should have mentioned that's probably typically the next step once you identify the next step assume that that intellectual property is available for licensing on the terms that you need so again once you've provided a commercialization plan and again often the University or entity and again I keep saying University because that's my background a lab but the licensure which is the person that owns the intellectual property or is the legal holder the patent the assignee of that patent that's that's what I'm referring to its a licensure and that can be a university a national lab a non-profit or an individual you could have somebody and this has happened where you have an individual who has written a patent or they have gotten it a sign through their labs most federal agencies have a provision to allow the inventor to own the technology is the is the University nonprofit decline then it simply goes back to the federal agency and if the federal agency declines to file for patent the inventor has the option to two and I know of several cases where that has happened and the individual inventor holds rights to their to their technology so it's important to note that this licensing process could be occurring with an individual inventor as well so again you will be asked to show either who your business team is who are you working with or how do you expect to raise the funds to commercialize this technology there's typically some licensing fee or option fee that is required of you and that is negotiable and that is something that we were working on and most universities and national labs are working towards reducing those fees for newly created companies and individuals so though the license will typically also have some milestones and here again we're talking about like but often the there's a precursor to a license which is called an option and an option is similar to a license because it gives the optionee the right to some to that technology if they meet the terms of the option and a lot of times that term would be raising a certain amount of cash which would enable you to commercialize so once you obtain that license or get an option you will be working towards meeting some type of milestone or payment and and after that and it's also important to know that you know as I discuss these steps this is not you know a single transaction or a single a simple single interaction this is typically an ongoing discussion and process of going back and forth here with that license sir thanks so what would a typical license look like it has a preamble which discusses and outline to the the parties are to the license it has definitions of all the different terms and then it has a number of articles and and I should mention again we'll have this available doe we recently put out a licensing guide for do e lab which would be useful probably in giving you an insight into other national labs as well at least those that are government-owned contract are operated and in there it talks about what all the cramps you know what all the definitions are the definitions again discuss you know that what an effective data is what the field of use is if there's a licensed product the licensing process what net sales mean what patent costs are what the royalties will be and then that defines it and then there's a great clause which is usually the most important part of the license which specifies what rights are transferred from the license or to the licensee and and so this is something that you want to make you know you want to ensure that your being granted the right right not just you know if you were expecting an exclusive license and its non-exclusive where you were expecting this field of views and you have a different fields of youth all in fact we did we did include there's a link to the gioi licensing guide for if you're interested again which will be helpful almost in any even for university because it does explain what some of the Bible requirements are in a license for instance before licensing the licensure must meet some friends of opportunity  requirements where they have widely publicized that technology to anyone before they can exclusively licensed to any one company and individual okay then there's an article typically on consideration in financial terms for the license and again i'll i'll be going through these what are the terms what is it that you will owe the licensure and when also very important in there they may also be some diligence terms in terms  f that you you know you may have committed to bringing that product to market in a certain time frame and signatures and appendix the appendix is usually a list of the fine portfolio and any other print information that may be required let's see do i have that here um yeah i think i will talk about that in a minute but within that the license you also have discussion of the patent prosecution who will lead the patent prosecution who is responsible for reimbursement and when typically once you license of technology if you are the exclusive license sir it will typically give you the right to work with that patent attorney on the patent prosecution and any actions that come up during the prosecution of the patent as well as your responsibility for reimbursement i can tell you that even though a lot of university and labs will defer patent costs to date a lot of them will expect you two to take on any occur recurring occurring reimbursement of those pansies for instance the maintenance fees and so on and then the condition of grants in terms for federally funded research you have some us competitive clauses that are required again going down the list of standard terms I've gone to the next slide this time insurance they will typically require you to have some insurance obviously in case you are sued and then this liability that you typically will release them of any liability either the institution the individual inventor of that technology and the milestones and along with milestones they may be some milestone payments as well and then product development and then another important part of that license will be fees what is the royalty in case of a startup you might provide equity in exchange for upfront fees for that and there's a number of ways I can tell you that most licensors will balance royalty to equity so the more the higher the royalty to lower the equity or the more equity you provide the lower the royalty fee so you should be prepared to balance those out and and in terms of for gioi I can tell you that we have some margin rights and again that's actually across the  oard for Vidal and marcin rice is the right that the government will have to federally funded research to ensure that it's being deployed and that somebody is not just sitting on the technology to prevent it from taking them out of business and so the government can if the government can show and again this is really important the government must show that there is a viable commercial market for this intellectual property that you're not capitalizing on and then it can compel you to provide a license to somebody else or practice now marching rights has never been exercised I think it's been threatened once since its existence and and clearly you can see why in a capital Society what patent owner would sit on valuable IP you know and not and not make money either through licensing or actually producing a product again the one case would be if you're trying to block somebody else or you don't that that technology might compete against something you have on the market and in which case you know I I don't think you'd want the government coming after you for that so and then there's the US manufacturing clause that says that we will provide one preference to somebody who offers to manufacture in the US so all things being equal the licensure of this federally funded research must provide preference to a company that offers to manufacture in the US for the US market so i should also mention that that we require us for the US market because we get this question was in practice is an invention overseas assuming that we do have IP protection overseas because if we don't then they're free to practice at invention but if they don't if we answer if we do have protection they are able to manufacture overseas for that and they also states that if you provide an exclusive license to somebody that they also have to carry on this us preference to their sublicensees so suppose I exclusively license from the Department of Energy and then I want to sublicense in a different field to two companies and one company is offering to manufacturing here in the US then I must provide preference so that preference carries through a license okay and as you may expect we have some export control requirements as well for those items that might be export control ok moving on here so some of the terms I've already discussed and these are the terms that are typically negotiable and those are the upfront fees and these upfront fees can take on many shapes forms again they could be just an upfront fee of a license they could be broken up into different payments throughout the year throughout the life of the license but they will typically again in the case of an exclusive license you can expect to have some minimum and again this also helps in due diligence because you know again if you are required to pay a fee you're going to move forward towards commercialization you're not going to sit there on the intellectual property so you have some minimums and they could be yearly minimums and along that you have you will have the royalty rate that you discuss and the equity and again remember i said is typically a balance between the equity and the royalty rates and again diligence and milestones patent costs and during the licensing negotiation you will negotiate whether some of these patents cost will be deferred and again a lot of universities and labs are kind of jumping on board on this at least I know I've encouraged gioi lab to defer patent call for one to two years for newly created company and a lot of like I said this is something that has been pretty standard for many universities where they defer patent costs were typically up to two years on those are incurred costs ongoing costs on the the licensee may be required to pay because no institution wants to be responsible for maintaining a license for somebody so if they decide they no longer want to pursue that patent but it's licensed to accompany they will be you know they will be compelled to keep it active and they may not want to have that responsibility so they often will shift the responsibility of ongoing patent costs to their licensee and again that's in the case of an exclusive license and again you could see it for partial use of licenses or even for non-exclusive licenses because you may think well why do they need a minimum if it's not exclusive they can license to other people but just having a non-exclusive license out there may hurt the licensing opportunities in the future and then somebody who comes in later on says well I want an exclusive and you have this non-exclusive just sitting out there so I can tell you that even for non-exclusive you may have a minimum it may not be as high as for an exclusive up so don't think that you know you're home free fits analysis of licensed field abuse again this is something that must be clearly defined in that you must be comfortable with I know this is something that causes it you know a lot of discussion in terms of and I can tell you what I've seen being here at the department of energy because we have an obligation to widely to close the technology you know a start-up would typically want all fields of views and the lab to want to have that individual or startup show how and why they need all the fields that they're requesting and they want you to want to make sure that you have plans to commercialize in those fields of use and again I know this this is it this is definitely one of the more important terms in that license because again one thing that we all know about smaller companies in start-up is that you will change so one of the things I've tried to support is that a you know providing startups wider field of views because you know you all need that runway to take off a lot of times you may think you're going to sell a product and you do a 180 and it turns out you're going to provide a service and you want again you want to make sure you have enough IP flexibility to pursue all the fields that you feel are are aviable for your company to pursue but again not being over greedy and understanding that the laps and the University and the nonprofit does have an obligation survival of why deployment and again I think we've discussed enough the exclusive and non-exclusive nature of the license and again it could be feel limited so I could do the field of automotive it could be even within a medical field you can have a subfield I've done you know for brain just a brain or the in gastric intestinal tract you know so it can be very few specific not you know you may think medical oh you could you could get down to even finer details and just article or country I should also mention that it could be exclusive by country so lots of ways to slice up that term some additional terms that are quite important and I think I've mentioned this apparent reimbursement I think I've spoken enough about that and the way it's typically done some other additional terms that you may not be thinking about are the right to sue for infringement I know early on at least in my tenure at Cal Tech we have the right to sue typically the licensure will have the right to sue will have the first right and in the license it will usually say if the licensure refuses or is unwilling to sue for infringement then that right is then transferred to the licensee but typically it is a sign e of that pattern that has the right to enforce it so if your license agreement is silent on that you usually will not have that right another important right is the sub licensing right so if depending on your field of use and again this is for I the sub-licensing right will only apply to exclusive licenses you could decide to sub-license to others either within the same field of views that you have but you cannot sublicense great any anything greater than what you already have which is really important so if you only have the automotive automotive market you know that is what you can sub licensing or within that sub field you can obviously go out and in license in the Aeronautics market so that's typically the right and the sub-licensing in with sub-licensing there are fees so and it will be different than your royalty fee and it's typically a higher percentage because depending on the technology it could be just a flow-through license where you have done no additional work on that intellectual property but you are just sub-licensing it and so the licensure will expect a higher fee for that and again it could be anywhere from fifteen to thirty percent by higher or higher that's just you know what I've seen that the sub-licensing right will be a lot greater especially in the case where again it's just a pass-through license and you've done no additional work on that intellectual property okay again just getting some specific based on the data the participants that I had gotten from Adam of the folks that typically attend the arpa-e University I'm assuming again that most of you are individual inventors individual small companies and so I wanted to focus a little bit on the needs special needs of startups and again as I talked about that in exchange for cash upfront cash a lot of startups are willing to provide some small equity share to the licensee and this is has been pretty standard at University and there are now even companies I know at least one osage partners that will buy the right from a university to to state to to make sure that their shares are undiluted so or to have the option to continue to buy into further financing rounds for that equity so it's definitely something that is increasing in popularity for universities to retain I know a lot of laps for the government-owned contractor operated labs have the ability to retain  equity the government-owned government operated labs do not and so it's unfortunate because you probably do not have that negotiating tool when dealing with strictly government-owned government operated laboratories and so in exchange most universities and labs that are licensing to startup need to view these startups as a partner and so again they will defer patent cost reimbursement that I spoke about they also will defer that minimum royalty payment for a few years and that's definitely something that you want to make sure that you've discussed you don't want to put where you are paying annual minimums before you have a product on the market but at the same time the university has to weigh your timeline with their need to ensure that commercialization is taking place so you know you do have a saying that and you should be realistic and I know a lot of times as you all know time flies by and you think oh I'm going to have a product out in 18 months and that 18 months turns into you know 36 months or longer and and so you wanna have some flexibility in there but I can tell you that again for an exclusive license you will have some minimum royalty payment and that is usually linked to net sales reduce royalty rate you may have some milestones where you know after a certain sales target your royalty rate can be decreased you could have a step royalty rate so up to this this number you know you're royalty rate maybe four percent above that then it goes down to two and anything above you know a million in sales or billion in sales whatever your market maybe you're you're royalty rate will decrease so that's something that's very important to note that you know you don't necessarily have a flat out royalty rate it could be it could be stepped and again the exclusivity and again he I mentioned exclusivity just because it is something that is usually a higher importance to small companies and startups that is typically your your cash there that that exclusivity that is the value of your company the right to be able to keep competitors out of you feel and then just to give you a feel for typical distribution that these startups will have most universities are not trying to be the owner of your company and nor should they be or laps you know the majority share of the company does belong to the founders and those that are working on the company and making it successful and then clearly where you have an option full pull for new employees and new investors and so on so this you know want to help startups here in this way and you know again the licensure should not be trying to get so much equity where you know they're breaking the company's back financially and so they definitely want to make sure that you have enough time and room to grow and again just in terms of the minimum royalty payments they're typically not do two or three years out and then again are willing to take a lawyer a lower royalty rate in terms of of higher equity so and and you know sometimes the licensure will insist a milestone payments and a lot of people do that to me is counterintuitive in terms of you know if you're doing really or you know you have these milestone payments but it does happen and in those cases you know you they may want to reconsider the motivation there for that okay so that and sort of the general overview of terms and again I'd be happy to answer any questions at the end of the presentation but I was also asked to provide an overview of what you could expect from your tech transfer offices for those you know professors or students or individuals that are working with the university increasingly the tech transfer offices are actually being viewed as a recruiting tool for attracting and retaining touted talented faculty so it's definitely a service that the university seeing is providing because in general tech transfer office unfortunately do operate in the red and a lot of just need to be trying to stay afloat in terms of recouping their costs but i just wanted to provide you a list of the typical activities that a tech transfer office will do and again this is giving credit to autumn which is the association of university technology managers and again the most basic function that a tech transfer office does is that they will identify and protect new invention now they only know about new inventions when those are reported by their faculty and staff and there's a technical evaluation that occurs they will usually there is some level of out reach out to their scientists in terms of what the the patent process is what is the licensing what could you expect as an inventor from the process and this is very important because if the inventor is not feeling engaged and that they are part of the process there are less likely to report also is the processes onerous so you don't want a 20-page document for reporting inventions and you know I see in some places that do a great job and a quick five initial five questions I know some universities will just have the professor submit their paper as part of the disclosure so you they definitely want to make it as painless as possible for reporting especially when a lot of scientists at least I know on the federal level are under full cost accounting so any time that they spend outside of their direct charge is not time to dare reimburse for and so want to be careful you know cognizant of that the tech transfer office always has the compliance responsibilities so they have to comply with the federal regulation that I mentioned one in reporting what those inventions are they typically also have to report when those inventions are licensed and in the case of us manufacturing sometimes they're asked to provide proof of that or if there's a waiver that's requested I don't think I mentioned that so in all cases where there's a US manufacturing preference or requirement there's also a waiver process in place or there should be where if a company can show net benefit back to the US economy whether or not they're manufacturing here in the US they are typically provided a waiver to show that okay an example of that people would use again not that this applies to Apple but in the case of Apple where you have a lot of manufacturing overseas the number of jobs that service jobs that are created here in the US for service and sales you may say that you know that cost is outweighed or there is significant benefit back to the US economy royalties collection and distribution the tech transfer office is also responsible for the collection of these royalties in the distribution of those royalties and I can tell you in most cases and you know the patents are equally owned by all inventors and I know this is something that would be touchy because unlike publication where you know you have the main inventor the main lead the lead author is the first author on a paper on a patent everyone is equal owner of that patent and when a patent is licensed most universities most licensors will distribute those royalties equally among all the inventors I had one case where all the adventures got together and decided that they would have a different distribution and I know that was allowed only because everybody signed off on that but typically you know royalties are shared equally among all inventors and they also provide support and managing conflict of interest most institutions have a process in place for if the adventure once the license the technology or the the inventor wants to be part of a company they have certain requirements certain processes that you must complete in order to ensure that there's no conflict of interest they also help manage inter-institutional agreements which I can tell you a lot of fun but as you know who scientists will collaborate and they often collaborate with somebody outside of their home institution and so they will manage those so you may have a joint invention between two universities a university and a corporation which again is a lot often the case for state sponsored research or a scientist at a university and somebody on a non-profit or another research institution and so they typically handle those they will also have boilerplate agreements of template agreements for non-disclosure agreements for material transfers for the options that we talked about for license and even for a memorandum of understanding and sometimes the sponsors response or research functions that up is co-located with the tech transfer office and sometimes it's not just depending on the institution and then they are also responsible for the development commercialization strategies for those technologies a lot of institutions will have an external panel that comes in and looks at the technology it's also important to know and this is something that I always stress with scientists explaining to them that you know the reason why their technology is not being patent is not based on the merit of the technology but it's purely a business decision often is will this technology be commercialized and we'll be able to recover patent costs patents are very expensive anywhere from 10 K to 100,000 depending on the technology depending on the country that you expect to pursue patent protection for I'm so they're very expensive and you want to make sure that at a minimum you're going to recover patent costs one of the last figures I saw was that less than 1% that's one percent of all patents actually generate income so you know that's that's a pretty ring statistic and so you know you want to make sure that when you're spending that much money there's at least an opportune oh you have a an opportunity to recover those costs so just overcoming some barriers I should mention that not all universities institutions have a tech transfer function a lot of times it is just an additional duty of their general counsel or of another office within the university of the institution that does licensing in that case you know might be a little more difficult or maybe easier because they just have a quick to retype like but there are a lot of resources that you can turn to and this is not by any means a complete list of those this was actually unfortunately done really quickly and I would have included more but I know for instance arpa-e has a number of original resources that you should be able to turn to also the satellite tech transfer USPTO offices that I alluded to at the beginning of my talk will provide some support there's a number of regional innovation hubs some of which are funded by do e you excuse me around the country there's also again autumn websites and a number of Kauffman Foundation that have resources for individual inventors and startup companies i'm losing my voice i think what was at the end here so we're good some lessons learned again not sure we may have actually some tech transfer professionals on the line and hopefully they'll agree with some of these but um you know any licensing is going to start at the intellectual property stage and it's going to start with some inventor who develops some really neat technology and so you know it's really important for these tech transfer office is to have good working relationship with their sciences it's also going to enable you as a licensee to have access to the inventor because it's anyone that has has a patent or has license a patent knows that a patent is not very useful without that background knowledge and know-how and that's typically resident in the scientist or the faculty member so as you negotiate your license you should also be able to negotiate what now how will come along with that license including you know some discussion with their inventor and their scientists and typically in these Sciences are the best marketing to they're the ones that are publishing papers they're going out making presentations that companies are listening to and trying to find out how  that technology can be applied to their product offerings and then I would also just encourage you all to get some basic knowledge of the patenting process you know what the different bars are what what constitutes a public disclosure you know the past somebody may think oh well I just emailed my my paper my presentation to this one individual but you don't know if that individual one is posting your presentation or your information of to you know to their company website or forwarding it to you know 500 technical staff of their organization so you should always assume again this is back to you as a scientist or as an inventor if you go out and publicly disclose your technology especially with this new American Invents Act and the fact that the way the legal language around the grace period is causing a lot of concerns for people and assuming almost at this grace period you know again being a better safe than sorry in that you want to make sure that you protect the intellectual property before you go out and make up a disclosure and again what constitutes a public disclosure again I would err on the side of caution there anytime that you're sending out of publication or you're speaking with someone and not knowing you know where that document is going also it's very important that you never offer your intellectual property for sale before you have filed a patent protection as well because that will constitute a bar against you in obtaining a penned in understanding the restrictions another important topic here yeah that's the last bullet which is understanding the restriction regarding the use of license ors name in in presentation you will see most institutions will have a cloth an article within the license that says that you shall not use their name as a 22 construed or or implicitly up imply a support of that product and but most cases you can state the fact which is I have license this technology has been licensed from this institution you are always able to state the fact okay you can't go around like the one time that the most fragrant activist I saw there was a company who went out and said you know do you think Cal Tech was licensed there this technology to just anyone and it's like you know and that may constitute or represent some kind of endorsement and and that's you know you can't do that but and I say this because you know I have seen this come up more than one where a company will present something in the license or will get upset either way one that you're not giving a proper attribution to the scientists or the technology or secondly  that you are going crossing over that line of either explicitly or implicitly apply referring to some endorsement so that's just something like I said that I've learned you know over the years to be very careful of and that you make sure that you are on the same page with the licensure in terms of how you can use their name for instance through many years at JPL people assume that if you like some something I JPL you could use the NASA meatball which would not be the case because you know calcite didn't even have the right to that that was held at NASA headquarters so just as an example and unfortunately I can see that I've gone over time here and we're not going to have a lot of time for questions but hopefully we'll have a few so i think i will end right here great thank you very much Rena and I think  that you do have some good questions I think you've given a good overview in any topic like this this is just a starting point you know we can't connect today can unfortunately consult with each of you on your syncretic situations but I think this should post just so everyone will know that slides from today's presentation will be posted on the rbe website within a week as with the other resources greena mentions judge it such as the deal we licensing died RPE technology resource map and other sources that can help you out if you don't get your question in today I want to start off with a couple questions that focus on the relationship from universities and startups and so we'll go to one that says you know if one inventor is from units from university the other is from the start the startup still have the license technology from the University yes they do most all I mean all universities those universities and nonprofits and just as companies do when you are an employer there and actually with with universities different actually cuz undergrads who pay to attend the University do not typically have to sign to the university but as a grad student especially if you're in a fellowship or that is a federally funded research that's being conducted you are obligated through your employee or student assignment to assign to that University and and so you assigned to the University and at times as i mentioned earlier is the university decides they do not want to fall upon protection for your technology and they assigned to you in that case you don't have to license but in most cases if you've expressed interesting and starting a company both universities will want to retain title and so you will want to license from that University great and this might that answer mine and already start to answer this question which is if you're as a private business owned by students it is used some university resources and they're giving the example the machine shop but they use their all their own material goodbye that business did the university didn't have right that yes it has no so it depends what kind of agreement you have in place if you are just up for the use of equipment and it's very clear that you know it is your own resources if you own staff you typically would not the university would not all that technology but again it's very different and depending you know what resources you're using and but i would I would tell you to make sure that you know if you're just going in and using equipment the university should not be taking clean for that technology and if they are then you just need to find  another partner to work with um taking a broader step back and with questionnaire how easy is it to amend the license we've talked about a lot of different terms and I think you mentioned a good point you know your work if you're a startup you're going to be pivoting a lot and so is this a working document and how how does that play out so it depends on the terms it should be it is definitely a living breathing document and depending on the tech transfer office and their resources you know it can't change obviously you can't think you're going to go back in there and  renegotiate all the terms and there's usually some give and take so if you want to come back in and you know maybe pay less royalties then maybe they'll want more equity or if you want to push out the payments a couple more years then I may want to increase that payment when it is due so it just depends on the terms of that agreement for instance if you want to increase the fields of use then I may again want to increase the royalties of some other payment so just depends on the term is definitely negotiable and you should be ready to go back and negotiate any terms that you need to make it business successful and then maybe another similar big picture question just going back issue of patent costs and then you mentioned that oftentimes licensors will defer those costs particularly the startup and we just for tax purposes define a few of those typical cost as in the royalties and different gingy to talk about them but also what you know why how does a typical terms i gots for startups when they're negotiating I me just the the question is you know who who might pay for example prosecution costumes like thinking through what are the different types of costs that might be deferred if you were to start on receiving one sure so typically the the costs that are typically deferred our cost to date so basically you know I like to call the sunk cost so anything that the university has paid or the licensor has paid up to that point they will or can defer or least partially defer or different part of that okay and some licensors will go as far as continuing to defer those costs and then so just depends where you are in licensing so is the pads already been issued you know maybe you're lucky and all those patent costs are deferred for two years and then that licensor will expect you to pay ongoing fees which just maybe the maintenance speech for that patent if you just is when you come in it's only the provisional and then there's some prosecution fees which are much higher that I do later on they the light of the license or may require you to pay all of those fees or part of those fees because they definitely want to feel like you have to get in the game so they definitely want to make sure that you are invested in that patent as they are they don't want to be left holding the bag where you know you can just terminate that license at any time and then you know i'm stuck with all the feet so it just depends how much it's usually the the fees have been paid to date will be deferred and i'm going to eat you're usually on the hook to pay some of those may be digging into royalties in particular the question here is just is one of the range of worldly rates that you've experienced which is saying there's an upward or downward trend they tend to be sales of revenue or profit they typically are on sale net sales and i've been limited most of my experience has been with one university in terms of royalty rates and i can tell you typical world and again it just is so varies depending on the field in the market but i would say somewhere between two and six percent and I know for like medical devices often it's a lot lower than that or biotech technologies but most of the royalties rates I've seen as somewhere in the range between like two and six and and mostly between two and four to be honest quick follow-up nothing can you define net sales and I'm just saying the vacuum you need to find very differently depending on sense sure so um let's see net sales typically refers to you're removing operating costs for that in any cost associated with getting that product out to the market but I was trying to see here if we had a good term and are in our boiler plate here but it's not because we don't this is just fun non-exclusive license but I you know and again I shouldn't even really talk about this because it will be different but those those net sales usually take away like I said the cop of the product to produce and maybe one final question is where are just a two o'clock going back to the American Invents Act and obviously that has a big impact and you provided some advice today on thinking about provisional patents you know really getting out there of them the question here is given the novelty rules encouraging early disclosure how do you see aia impacting some what's publication strategy and whether or not you and I think they might be referring to you know if you can get something published without a patent right that might be a way of protecting a patent by making it probably know sure yeah so it depends what your strategy is so if if your strategy is to make something publicly available so that nobody else can retain a patent and block you from using that technology and you know publish to your heart's content so long as again you've met your  employer's obligation you may if you you know if you have an obligation to report that might not just be your hands and so you want to consult with with the office that may own that invention that's one thing but if your strategy is to protect that technology and have some patent in a you know at a later date you definitely want to file at a minimum a provisional patent to get that date and especially right now because this these new rules are just being implemented and folks our little nervous in terms of again what does the legal language really need and so until we have some cases I haven't tested I think again I would err on the side of caution fabulous Granna thank you very much for your time today Hank en are you having and thank you to everyone for dialing in I know that we weren't able to get to all of
