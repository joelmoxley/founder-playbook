Philosophy and Process
* Encourage lots of quality disclosures
* Make available technologies widely known
* Make extensive use of lower cost provisional patent applications
* Use in-house counsel especially to file “at risk”
* Pursue a fair return 
* Provide service to the researchers



Responsibilities of Tech Transfer
* Licensing Berkeley Lab inventions and software, and managing those licenses for the many years they are in place (~ 300 active licenses)
* Patenting Berkeley Lab inventions (~ 290 US patents)
* Developing research partnerships with the private sector (~$100 million in partnership portfolio since 1994)
* Marketing the lab’s capabilities and inventions (promoted > 450 Lab inventions) 
* Serving as primary interface with the private sector and representing the Lab at various entrepreneurial, commercial, and regional economic development activities 



Licensing
* Invention assessment
* Patenting decisions
* Negotiation of licenses
* License maintenance
* Support Lab researchers in moving materials, developing businesses, etc




Marketing Goals
* Attract qualified licensees and research partners
* Meet fairness of opportunity requirements
* Collect industry feedback on LBNL techs
* Build long term relationships
* Increase recognition of LBNL
* Deliver internal education on technology transfer



Industrial Outreach/Marketing Vehicles
* Technology Transfer website
      * www.lbl.gov/tt
* Technology Announcements
* Meetings, conferences, visits
* Technology Transfer collateral 
* Internal training and inventor resources
* DOE Technology Commercialization Fund
* Entrepreneur in Residence Program



Patents
* Obtain patent protection for selected technologies
    * Draft, prosecute and maintain patents
    * Manage external counsel
    * Manage DOE obligations and interface
    * Review licenses
* Review of consulting agreements
* Publication review
* Dispute management



Why Are Your Deliverables Important To Us?
* Licensing professionals are each managing hundreds of cases, seldom get to do the “deep dive” into the technology or application
* You may find a new market or application
* You may save us money
* You may provide the scientist with valuable insight



Tips In Dealing With Inventors
* Do your homework; read the invention description and any other material offered
* Discuss among your team members; let the technical member be your interpreter
* Schedule a meeting at least a week in advance if possible
* Prepare both general and specific questions
* Consider recording the meeting if the scientist agrees
* If you are going to ask for feedback on your intermediate work, make sure you give plenty of time
