Bayh-Dole Legislation
* Applies to all federally-funded research (except scholarships/fellowships/training grants)
* Reporting/compliance requirements
* Allows universities/non-profits to elect title to inventions made with federal funding
* Universities charged with commercializing
* Government gets paid-up license
* Royalties shared with inventors
* Revenues must be used for research or education
* Patents cannot be assigned (except to a patent management organization) without permission of funding agency



What is a license?
* A LICENSE is an enforceable contract
* Licensor waives its right to exclude licensee to make, use or sell the patented invention, in exchange for consideration
    * Can be exclusive, non-exclusive, partially exclusive limited to a specific field of use/time
    * Can be for a patent, an invention that has not yet been granted a patent, software, copyright, know-how, combinations



Process for obtaining a license
* Identify intellectual property
* Provide business plan and market projection
* Verify company has resources to commercialize (including business team)
* Be prepared to show serious intent ($$)
* Enter negotiations with licensing executive
    * Many terms in a license are open to negotiation
* Work toward meeting milestones/payments
* Typically not a single transaction/interaction



Anatomy of a License
* Preamble
* Definitions
* Articles
* Terms
* Signature
* Appendix (i.e., list of patent portfolio)
Ref: http://techtransfer.energy.gov/LicensingGuideFINAL.pdf



Standard terms
* Insurance
* Liability
* Milestones/product development
* Fee (royalty, equity, etc.)
* DOE-required:
    * March-in Rights

Overcoming Barriers – where to turn if you don’t have a TTO
* Regional legal resources
    * Maryland Intellectual Property Legal Resource Center (MIPLRC), University of Maryland
* Local Start-up America Organizations
    * White House Initiative run by Entrepreneurs for Entrepreneurs

    * Oregon Best (Portland, Oregon)



Lessons Learned
* Develop a good, trusting relationship with the Tech Transfer Office (honest evaluation of prior art)
* Scientists/inventors are the best marketing tool for their technology
* Acquire basic knowledge of patent process (i.e. bars)
* Offer for sale
* Public disclosure /publication
* Understanding restrictions regarding the use of a Licensor’s Name in presentations
