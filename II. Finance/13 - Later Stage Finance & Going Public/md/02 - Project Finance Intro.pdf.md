   Project Finance – Working Definitions
“Project finance involves the creation of a largely independent project company financed with equity from one or more sponsoring firms and non‐recourse debt for the purpose of investing in a capital asset”
“A form of specialised financing that relies on the assets of a ‘ring fenced’ project and the future cash flows that those assets produce as the sole source of debt repayment”

Total New Clean Energy Investment
• $44 trillion global investment required by 2050 just to develop a low carbon economy (IEA)
• PLUS huge needs in other sectors: water, sanitation, health, transportation, minerals etc.
• Project finance will play a significant role

 Why COST of capital is almost as important as AMOUNT of capital
For any proposed capital program or new technology:
• If it does not scale, it does not matter.
• If it is not economic, it will not scale.
• If it requires capital investment, but does not have a path forward to attracting low cost capital, it very likely won’t be economic.
So, finding the path forward to low cost capital is often difficult, but will be the key factor in achieving success at scale.
7

       What is low cost capital?
The all‐in cost of the entire capital stack. Compare:
Favorable Unfavorable
 Lots of debt leverage
 Lower interest margins
 Longer maturities
 Slower amortization
 Lower targeted equity returns
 Less debt leverage
 Higher interest margins
 Shorter maturities
 Quicker amortization
 Higher targeted equity returns

   An example: large fleet of LNG carriers
• Senior secured debt facilities with commercial banks for up to US$2.2 billion
• Subordinated secured debt facilities with commercial banks for up to US$175 million
• Senior secured bonds due 2033 for US$850 million (rated Aa3 by Moody’s, A+ by S&P, and A+ by Fitch)
• Subordinated secured bonds due 2033 for US$300 million (rated A1 by Moody’s, A‐ by S&P, and A‐ by Fitch)
• Senior secured debt facility with the Export‐Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) for up to US$500 million
• Senior secured debt facility with a syndicate of commercial banks insured under a Korea Export Insurance Corporation (KEIC) insurance guarantee for up to US$225 million.

    Who uses project finance markets?
Three major users of this market:
1.
Independent companies challenging incumbents (e.g. regulated investor owned utilities) with newer, often greener technology
2.
Large, asset‐heavy companies that are trying to minimize direct, on balance‐sheet credit exposures in order to preserve their investment grade credit ratings
3.
Large, highly‐rated companies in Joint Ventures who want: a) to keep the debt of the J.V. off their individual balance sheets and;
b) to clearly define the limits of each J.V. member’s exposure to the project.
Must use PF
Need to use PF if they possibly can
Using PF for convenience and good corporate hygiene

   Example Finance Documentation Structure

 Developing a financeable project is about thoughtful and complete risk allocation
• Identifying and allocating risks are at the heart of project financing • Each risk must be addressed and allocated to some party to the
transaction—an intricate process
• The ability of the project company to absorb risks is limited, so most
risks get addressed by a contract to some project participant
• Lenders are willing to finance a project with only certain types of risks
• Lenders get a lien on everything (project assets and contracts, equity in the project company) but their first line of defense is making sure that the project is strong. Foreclosure—particularly on a deficient project—is not attractive
22

 Examples of Key Project Risks
1. Feasibility study and reserve analysis
2. Construction
• Multiple contracts, difficult countries 3. Operation
4. Commercial
• Price fluctuation, volatility of cash flow
5. Political
6. Legal
