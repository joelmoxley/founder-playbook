This webinar explores a new, potential source of capital for energy technology innovation: charitable investments. Although charitable investments in energy technology companies are still in their infancy, this webinar examines program-related investments (PRIs) and other charitable financing tools that could help support early-stage energy technology entrepreneurs.

hello and welcome everyone I'm Nate Gorence technology to market advisor here at our PE thanks for tuning into
this ARPA-E University webinar titled charitable investment for energy innovation 101 i'm joined today by two esteemed guests david bank who is CEO and editor of impact alpha which is an investment news service focused on sustainability and my other guest is sarah carne founder and executive director of the prime coalition which is a nonprofit organization focused on drawing charitable capital into market-based climate-friendly solutions I'm not going to go through their long and illustrious BIOS they are certainly illustrious and will be posted alongside this presentation but at the onset here at arpa-e wanted to thank them for providing their expertise and participation today so what are we hoping to accomplish we're going to take a quick 45 minute tour on charitable investments and how they can be applied to clean energy I'll briefly set the stage and yr PE cares about this domain and some of the capital challenges we are seeing David will follow me with presentation providing an overview of program related investing the evolution of this tool and the lessons from some other sectors will then pivot to Sarah who provide an overview of how charitable investing can support clean energy and the approach the prime Coalition is taken will conclude with a few minutes of moderated Q&A so let me just start with a brief refresher on our PE we are the hip cool stepchild of the Department of Energy we're a semi-autonomous agency that invests over 280 million dollars per year in high risk but potentially transformational energy technologies we have a very broad mission and compasses energy efficiency reducing reducing energy imports and reducing energy emissions which enables us to fund all kinds of crazy ideas ranging from flying wind turbines to personalize robots that control your temperature envelope to novel fusion reactors to UAV mounted methane sensors very wide gamut how do we do this you know we fund teams from academia startups and small businesses and even large corporations to pursue novel ideas that can fundamentally hange the learning curve of a technology we don't look for incremental improvements it's certainly important work to march down the cost curve and lots of organizations do this what we seek to do is is fund disruptive ideas that can fundamentally change our energy landscape in terms of cost performance or both to accomplish this you know we know that many of the technologies we fund will fail and you'll see you'll see those on this graph marked by the X but the few that do succeed will make an outsized impact now at RPE we not only require teams to take on a lot of technical risk and push them to succeed technically we also want to make sure that they make commercial progress because really that's the only way to disrupt the energy market place in fact the driving question that we pose to every single project here at RV is if it works will matter and how do we measure if it matters well we've been around for about seven years we've awarded 1.3 billion dollars to over 500 projects and some of the leading indicators that we've had to date are that we've had 45 projects raise over 1.2 billion in private sector sector equity had 36 new companies formed and we've had over 60 government partnerships and hand offs and you know while we view this is great progress in our seven our seven years of history really what we see these are leading indicators what ultimately matters our products deployed at scale in the marketplace today we have over 14 RV projects in the commercial marketplace we expect many more however the big challenge is that funding novel energy technologies especially hardware is really freaking hard if capital intensive has long product cycles oftentimes decades it's typically an undifferentiated product and almost always competes in the commodity market place that has been built up with trillions of dollars over more than a century and so what we play a significant role in early stage funding our typical engagements are around three years we need our projects to continue beyond the term of our award if they're going to march toward the commercial arena and fundamentally this requires additional follow-on funding could be a government entity could be a philanthropic could be a private sector but our teams need cash to get to get to the marketplace which brings us to the purpose of today you know there really is for those of us haven't played in the space there's a clear and acute challenge in bringing early-stage equity capital to clean energy technologies there was a whole lot of enthusiasm in the venture capital community 67 years ago when the thinking was that you know the global energy market is many multiples the size of the internet and is ripe for disruption however the Queen tech success stories have been limited and the amount of capital as you can see on the top of this graphic especially for early-stage hardware has declined precipitously it's not only that you know and it's not only venture capitalists that will have learned that clean tech is definitely not tech the limited partners the folks that contribute capital into specific funds of different venture firms they've also retreated from the clean tech space and you know I think the quote that's illustrative there the bottom is that based on the survey of limited partnerships only five percent said they would focus on green on green focused funds going forward so not a lot of great news but is there any good news we think there are some interesting developments related to new sources of capital wanting to come into the clean energy space and you know along with that capital there's a better understanding that this market has particular challenges scale up requirements lumpy investments very long tenures and so you know on this slide I want to which I'm sure many have seen you see the energy development cycle and the two valleys of death here at rpe were very much focused on the innovation value of death applied rd getting to a prototype or proof of concept however you know what's encouraging about the clean tech space is that orbital a couple years there have been a number of asset owners foundations and program related investments family offices high net worth individuals to name a few that have signaled a willingness to come and invest along this this development and deployment chain some are focused on the earlier stage some span the entire gamut but that is what we're going to dive into today and learn about and with that I'm excited to turn it over to David nate I'm delighted to be here you and Sarah and have been great teachers on the energy front all right we at impact alpha have been looking across the range of investments in ventures and projects that have social environmental benefits kind of under the rubric of what's come to be called impact investing and in particular we're looking at areas where there are capital gaps where the commercial capital markets are not financing the kinds of things that are required in in various sectors whether it's smallholder farming or conservation finance or small and medium enterprise development and we've gotten in that context interested in a category of funding called program related investments and I will get into what those are there's a fair amount of wonky policy aspects to it but the basic idea is that their foundations can deploy a capital to for-profit enterprises traditionally of course foundations have been giving am usually given grants and usually to nonprofits and so the notion that foundations can invest in for-profit enterprises is relatively new the the program related investments themselves go back about 50 years but for most of that time they were fairly what we call you know vanilla loans to nonprofits to buy a building or something to have their operations more recently some strategic investors and among the bleeding foundations have realized that this is a kind of category of capital they have that can be used to bridge these capital gaps and the reason is that they're not as constrained as as commercial investors for either the low risk or high returns that commercial investors have come to expect so they have the ability to be kind of flexible patient either high risk or low return capital and in that context the leading foundations are thinking maybe we can do something that's not just funding the only one venture but we can actually change the dynamics in a marketplace and we can crowd in commercial capital for these kinds of projects more broadly so the kinds of of ways that this that this capital can be used and this slide shows it is demonstrating a sector or a market so that you know that where the marketplace and you mentioned the sort of rise and fall with clean tech investing where the marketplace has decided that there's something funky about this space and and and there's but but perhaps that can be disproven there's particular risks that can be mitigated in various cases so sometimes its capital can be used as first law guarantees or other kinds of ways to reassure investors in many cases those guarantees never get called and it's actually a relatively cheap way to to change the investment dynamics of a particular venture sometimes a company just needs to create a track record and get into business and then that company will be off and running and be able to attract commercial investors sometimes there's other kinds of ways that are sort of financial engineering ways where you syndicate and bundle up risks to to diversify and then sometimes it's literally a subsidy and that just brings in commercial capital by frankly raising raising their returns and there's no controversy around that I should say you know should private foundations charitable foundations be effectively juicing up the returns of commercial investors and there's a raging debate one one one side of it says you know that's not appropriate used to charitable fund the other side says hey we've put in a very little bit amount of money we've got it in a lot of commercial capital and in fact that we've leveraged our are very small amount of philanthropic money in a good way the so to get into the weeds a little bit on what the legalities of program related investments are and it is kind of the standard definition investments to support charitable activities that involve a potential return of capital so that's pretty broad but it is but the key to it is the primary purpose has to be charitable and foundations will be bend over backwards and and consult a lot of lawyers to make sure that the purpose is charitable and will in many cases write that into you know legally binding contracts financial return is not a significant purpose and this is a key factor to you can't go into it as a foundation seeking to make a high return now that's often misunderstood you can in fact but in the end have made a high return it just can't be your primary purpose your primary purpose must be charitable and then of course you can't use it to influence legislation within that there is quite a lot of flexibility in how this how this kind of capital can be used an example is a low-interest loan that Packard Foundation made to a fund called ecotrust forest that was trying to demonstrate sustainable timber practices in the Pacific Northwest now the pacific northwest of course is a great timber region but because the wood there is so valuable the timberlands that that grow it are very expensive and makes the returns for a sustainable timber farm less competitive with what you know commercial and the timber practices might might get and so timber investors would shy away from sustainable timber funds so we could truck forest has a very developed strategy of how do you manage timber for both timber returns but also other kinds of benefits for jobs for wildlife for water for scenic benefits and they used this 10 million dollar one percent loan from the tactic foundation to backstop what I think was a 2 million dollars fund overall lower their overall cost of capital which allowed them to have higher overall returns and that brought in commercial investors who topped up the fund and the idea there is that in fact if all things work out the returns on that funds will in fact justify computer commercial investors in follow on foot so it's demonstrating the market potential of a comprehensive holistic sustainable timber management another example direct early-stage equity and this may be more relevant to the early-stage climate innovation the Gates Foundation has made 14 investments totaling 167 million dollars in early-stage biotech companies now a lot of these biotech companies are focused on you know blockbuster drugs that will have a great effect in the developed markets they tend not to focus on neglected diseases so-called in the developing world where the commercial returns are obviously much lower but often the same platform the same biotechnology is useful in both cases so what the Gates Foundation is done generally speaking is both make investments in the company itself a direct equity investment and then also supply grant funding to to underwrite the specific investments in malaria or TB or HIV and then the company is obligated actually to obviously do that work but also to make the subsequent drug discoveries available in the in those low-income countries at affordable prices and this is written into what's called the global access agreement which is a look again a legally binding contract that obligates them to this to this pricing regime and one that we focus on in this report that we've put out in the spring it deals with Chi ma'am a UK company that has a mouse transgenic mouse that mimics the human immune system and the gates and a she put a 20 million dollar equity investment into it and it is quite high risk at the time the company was facing various IP patent infringement lawsuits and whatnot and other investors were shying away but the mouse technology was valuable for as I said malaria and TB and HIV and the Gates Foundation wanted to make sure that it was available to those kind of researchers and in fact the patent legal dispute got ironed out they got subsequent investment and I think there's some recent news that they've made some breakthroughs zombie HIV front and then a third way is a investments into fund managers themselves if people don't often remember dbl partners is now quite well known for their investments in Tesla and solar city and other home runs but when they started they had a thesis around not only clean tech but also low income job development economic development and they were shot commercial investors commercial LPS would not invent than they got raised most of this first hunt 75 million dollar funds from foundations like scored casing the car sir the Heron foundation those investments at least enough of them proved out and they have last year raise to their third fund for four hundred million dollars and of course they're not now eligible for these program related investments because they are quite a commercial market rate rate fund but early foundation money played a key role in sort of proving out both the cleantech thesis and also this economic development pieces so given how effective and leverage these investments can be made you think that all foundations would say wow this is this is this is this is an effective strategy where we can take what is you know sounds like a large amount step seven hundred billion dollars or seven us foundation endowments but really is just a drop in the bucket compared to what's needed to move the needle on these big social environmental challenges you think they'd say well we can leverage the private capital markets to come along with us and then and work on these challenges but in fact PR eyes are still quite a small slice of Foundation grant funding and so there's that 50 billion dollars in grants and there's been some 104 billion dollars total in the last 15 years ntr eyes and and this is partly a risk avoidance issues for the foundations there's been some level of ambiguity about what's actually allowed under the IRS rules there's also transaction costs legal legal costs other ways destructed other costs destructuring these deals that have kept some foundations from being able to do this there's progress on all of these fronts last year the earlier this year the IRS issued new guidance they put out what what are basically sort of templates or examples of kinds of investments that can qualify as PR i--'s this disease research example that I mentioned in terms of early-stage biotech is now kind of covered by these examples nuclear guys kind of loan guarantees smallholder AG finance and and some environmental and some environmental areas but they did not call out and i think sarah will get into this more early-stage climate or climate at all as a at the particular area PRI so that's still on the on the horizon the the takeaways i guess is both for entrepreneurs and professors for entrepreneurs if you have a charitable purpose if you are a mission driven company if you believe that your company will solve some some some big big challenge that's important to the world you might want to think about whether you can get a interest a foundation in providing a program related investment you need to know what your impacted and ou need to be able to describe how you're going to measure it and sometimes that may be at odds or your investors may think it's at odds with your commercial opportunities so you have to weigh those those those pros and cons you if you have such a such a such a mission and you have such a product you may be able to get grants to cover some of the early on the cost of it and then as I said beware the hidden costs the capital so it sounds like you know low cost money but in fact there were reporting requirements there are all the kinds of things that come along with any kind of strategic investor who may have other agendas besides necessarily the total success of your company they may have you know just like corporate and strategic investors are looking for synergies with their product line you know Foundation strategic investors may be looking for system change outcomes that are that are not necessarily a central to your own mission so there are there are costs it's not just free money but it is an interesting source of capital and then for Co investors who you know might see that there's an interesting domain of investment but that there are you know sort of risks that they can't necessarily mitigate whether those are political risks whether those are long term long time horizons other kinds of risks that this may be a way to kind of make the deal work there's foundations have great access both to in the fields to the NGO world to a government world sometimes so the scientific world that can give that can give access and knowledge there's other kinds of ways where the money is helpful again there's also potential for misalignment between the different kinds of investors and everybody should be aware of what the different players are bringing to the table and finally of course when you're dealing with these all these kinds of requirements and legalities the foundation world may move more slowly they had the venture capital world is is used to and if you're going to get in bed with with charitable foundations you should be prepared for sometimes some longer time horizons in getting the deals done so without it look forward to the take miss to the energy example in particular well thank you very much data that was a great overview and above the landscape history some exam IRS guidance and then entrepreneur and investor guidance for pris which really sets the stage for for Sarah's talk and whole past the photographer now about how pris can relate to energy so with that Sarah all yours maybe hi everyone my name is sarah carne and outside of spending time with my family one of my biggest passions and life is unlocking the floodgates of philanthropic capital to support energy innovation and deployment I get out of bed every morning to try to do my part to help mitigate climate change and I see my personal contribution as trying to move more charitable contribution into early stage energy companies so I'm just thrilled to join me in David today to share more about what I've learned over the past decade working at the intersection of philanthropy and energy innovation my journey to the field started in 2006 when I started serving as executive director and trustee of the Chiss ona's Family Foundation it next took me to graduate school at MIT in 2010 or I learned that there are many underused ways to put charitable capital to work for early-stage energy ventures and then I founded prime in 2014 to knock down the very high barriers that are holding the field back prime is a public charity that facilitates demonstrative charitable investments and builds connectivity between philanthropists and climate innovators I'll speak for the next 15 minutes about where the field is charitable investing to support clean energy stands today and what we've built at prime to encourage increased philanthropic investment activity in the energy sector in years to come to start I agree strongly with what mate described earlier in the webinar there are gaps in the innovation and deployment pipelines that are absolutely holding us back from achieving our climate and energy goals these capital gaps are preventing us both from building financially successful for-profit companies or projects like many RVE grant recipients but they're also holding us back from achieving social outcomes such as climate change mitigation environmental conservation advancement of science economic development and job creation or poverty alleviation and these are the charitable causes that are paramount for charitable investors just as David mentioned earlier as context for my talk I should mention that charitable capital could step into any of the capital gaps outlined above on this slide that are not covered by traditional investors but at prime today we focus exclusively on the earliest stages of company formation primarily because we know the capital gaps one and two outlined here are acute and we know that we might be able to shake free investment in the size that early stage companies need even though philanthropic investment in this area is and its really really early days we've already heard from Nate the private investment into early-stage energy companies has decreased precipitously over the past decade leaving us with virtually no ones that's willing to go first in supporting new ventures that might be capital intensive have long technology development timelines have necessary piloting or testing with risky outcomes are competing against entrenched incumbents or operate in an industry with poor Valerie for valuation comparables unfortunately the numbers on this slide are usually surprising to philanthropist that may not be in the weeds on venture investing the good news is that philanthropist do indeed have the tools that they need to step into the gap David already shared how pioneering foundations have started to support for profit companies with charitable capital in other sectors using a tool called a program related investment for PRI PRI is just one of many tools available to charitable investors which I'll speak more about later in my presentation the bad news is that PRI making to the energy sector has been virtually non-existent since pris were first written into the tax code in 1969 the PRI records outlined on this slide are from a group called the Foundation Center that scrapes data from Foundation's annual tax forms unfortunately their records are only cover PRI making from 1998 through 2014 but i think these numbers are descriptive enough to give us all a sense of what's happening of the five thousand eight hundred and sixty-one pris recorded by the foundation center since 1998 less than three percent pertain science and engineering innovation and of those 33 separate transactions that point six percent pertain to climate change mitigation it's important to note that more than half of those 33 are related to the developing world which means that only 15 single transactions have focused on domestic technology innovation related to climate change I think we can and will do better than 15 deals in the next 20 years like I said before PR is from foundations are just one tool available to philanthropists to support early-stage energy innovation it's critically important to acknowledge that there are many different types of charitable asset owners each of whom confront distinct challenges in mobilizing impact investment capital us-based private foundations combined for a whopping 600 billion dollars in assets under management but it's important to know that that's spread over 86,000 different organizations and that sixty percent have less than 1 million dollars in assets under management however all of you combined for approximately 50 billion dollars in grants per year as David mentioned before the top 10 corporate foundations have approximately 10 billion dollars in assets under management but corporate giving in total approximates 19 billion dollars in grants every year donor-advised funds have continued to increase in popularity over the past 10 years and today they approximately have 70 billion dollars in assets under management and grants 13 billion dollars annually this includes the 800 community foundations in the US each of which managed donor-advised funds for local residents Community Foundation's alone comprised ten percent of total u.s. grant making for about five billion dollars annually the information presented on this slide does not include additional charitable actors like single-family offices multifamily offices with philanthropic advisory services and high-net-worth households that might not use the foundation or a donor-advised fund structure for their charitable giving but these are really important charitable actors as well especially in the US where ninety-eight percent of you of our households give an average of ten percent of their annual income to charity so what the heck is happening putting terrible capital to work and enter early-stage energy companies seems like a no-brainer right and giving in the way that David outlined earlier also seems like a no-brainer if you can make it grants once and never see the money again or you can make a grant in the style that we're talking about and potentially get it back even in part whole or plus gains to regram to other good causes that seemed it seems pretty pretty obvious to those of us in the commercial space but when I first started learning about the stuff in 2011 I was flabbergasted to learn the PR eyes were a thing and that no one was using them for energy innovation so here are some of the things we heard on our listening tour in 2013 this happened after I finished writing my MIT thesis in 2012 about how PR i--'s had been used in the field in the past and before we incorporated prime in 2014 to knock down those barriers we met with hundreds of people from all sorts of charitable organizations and we uncovered a very long list of barriers that are preventing this type of charitable investment from being made more frequently I'd put these barriers into three categories number one educational barriers number two operational barriers and number three perceived policy barriers which David alluded to earlier to start with the educational barriers many philanthropists don't know just how acute the mismatches today between traditional risk investors and early-stage climate innovation even if they do know sometimes they don't know that they have tools in their toolbox to do something about it which takes us to our operational barriers even if they know there's a gap and they can fill it most philanthropic organizations are not organizationally supported to do the deal sourcing due diligence structuring of terms and to become a value-added member of a board of directors for an early stage for profit tech company this includes both the organizational level but also in a personal level you can imagine being someone that the program officer at a foundation who's been making grants to nonprofits all of a sudden being asked to behave like a venture capitalist it's a very difficult thing lastly perceived policy barriers it's very difficult of a deal by deal basis to know with certainty that an investment qualified as charitable especially since neither climate change nor entered is a charitable purpose in the tax code but let me be clear there is nothing that needs to change in the tax code in order for the philanthropy community to support early-stage climate innovators I'll say that part again there is nothing that needs to change in the tax code in order for the philanthropy community to support early-stage climate innovators so what are we doing to bring down the barriers and unlock the flood gates as I said before prime was purpose built in 2014 in an effort to lower as many of these barriers as possible for charitable investors today we're a public charity that means we're a nonprofit organization supported by forward-leaning grant makers to source and facilitate demonstrative transactions that can be held up as case studies for the field of philanthropic investing and to build better connectivity between philanthropists and climate innovators such as this working on this webinar with RP and impact alpha at prime we think of ourselves as a two-sided marketplace you can imagine an investment bank whose paramount end goal is to mitigate climate change rather than to make a profit don't get me wrong we want the companies we support to make lots and lots of money in fact we only support for profit innovators whose product or service is in lockstep with global greenhouse gas emissions reduction but we offer our services to the field for free because it's so early days for philanthropic investors in the energy sector and somebody needs to absorb the very painful failed cycle in the early days and we want to be those people today we have two ways to encourage philanthropists to enter the field of energy innovation to date these individuals tend to be people that are way out ahead of the curve deeply understand our mission from personal experience and also deeply care about field building first they can dip their toe as operational supporters of prime itself and second we bring philanthropist in as participants in the demonstrative investments that Prime is facilitating so to date we've had ten funder support Prime and eight funders support our docket companies but we're just getting started and we work hard every day to bring more philanthropist into the field I think it's important to mention that something that's really important to us at prime is to bring in new actors not just hit up the usual suspects like the family offices that many of you have probably heard of or worked with that already have their own energy investment deal teams we're all about being additive and not duplicative like I said before we have two nonprofit programs that we run today facilitating demonstrative investments and building connectivity between philanthropists and climate innovators I won't talk much about the second program today but i will talk for a few minutes about our first 2 proof-of-concept investments quit net energy and red wave energy quit net energy is a company that was founded by a team with extensive experience in the oil and gas industry they're using oil and gas wells that are no long no longer producing hydrocarbons to turn pumped hydro storage on its head they put water under pressure down hole and then remove the pressure to make the water shoot out of the wells and turn a turbine for ultra low-cost grid capacity energy storage this is radically different from a battery company or another high-tech solution but all could net needed to do with it was a field test that no one else was willing to pay for and so with time support the equipment team has been able to crush their technical milestones and now quit net has raised the follow-on round of capital from commercial inductors and I think this is becoming kind of quickly becoming a fascinating case study for high-risk high-reward philanthropy where philanthropic investors went first retired technical risk and gave the team sufficient data to encourage commercial follow on investments in an industry that doesn't have that many traditional VC is actively investing this is really exciting stuff I'll go into more detail that the mechanics of the prime coalition for could net transaction in just a moment first let me tell you more about our second investment red wave energy red waves team closed their series be round with a number of strategic investors that had a mandatory matching requirement the prime coalition of philanthropists stepped in to serve as that match and unlock a six million dollar capital raised red wave develops a material that promises efficient conversion of industrial waste heat into electricity I'm sure everyone watching this webinar knows that almost sixty percent of the world's energy is currently lots of heat so this could be a big big deal for reducing dream up global greenhouse gas emissions by making fossil fuel consumption more efficient the investments that Prime has made into quid net and red waves are first of their kind and we've learned a whole lot along the way this slide shows the options we now know are available to various charitable asset owners to place charitable capital into early-stage energy companies that would achieve their climate impacts at scale are attractive to follow on commercial investors but are dying on the vine because of the challenging venture capital environment that nate describes before some of these options include working through prime as a public charity and some do not in our experience many philanthropic investors prefer to work through grant making to a public charity like prime rather than direct PRI making because it's more similar to what they've been set up to do for years it doesn't make a difference to prime because we aren't emunerated in either case and our only goal is to get our docket companies supported in a period of time I won't go into detail on all of these mechanics right now but please reach out directly to team Prime if you're a philanthropist and would like to learn more we're here to share what we've learned and this stuff is very challenging to do really well by yourself this slide shows how the prime coalition of philanthropists participated in could net energy seed one round to accredited households that cared deeply about climate impact made traditional convertible notes directly to the company and did not receive any type of tax benefit the storms and impact foundation a group based in Salt Lake City and really leading the charge to pioneer PRI making across industries in the u.s. made a convertible note directly to quit net and counted it as a program related investment for their foundations that means it counted as a grant but it looked like a traditional convertible note and then the Will and  Jada Smith foundation in Los Angeles participated as a recoverable grant for Prime like the direct investors will and Jada's foundation will also receive their grants plus interest back in a success scenario four quid net without fine taking a cut we really like the recoverable grant structure as an option and we think it's under discussed in the field but pretty similar to program related investments to our knowledge the support of could net the first time that traditional angel capital PRI capital and grant capital sat next to each other to support an early-stage energy company but this is exactly the type of transaction we'd like to see replicated many many times over in the years to come as you can see the prime Coalition for red wave again brought together different types of charitable asset owners using different mechanisms but our priority at time is to make all of this easy for the company receiving investment and to do our very best to make the company only more attractive to saulo on investors by not messing with the terms this is not dumb money this is even smarter money the red wave deal pulled together donor-advised fund participants for the first time for prime which we see is one of the most promising groups of investors for future transactions donor-advised funds are similar to foundations except they have less strict requirements on their grant making we're also thrilled to have just good step in as our first corporate donor into this deal and we're hopeful that more and more corporations will realize that this is a really smart way to give so as I've said we want to see more deals like quit that and red wave get done both for their own impact affecting Prime's mission of climate change mitigation at scale but also as examples of what types of deals could be done with charitable capital here's the short list of companies that made it on two primes 2016 docket we will be thrilled if we can support at least two more of these by the end of 2016 our goal isn't to own the space or highlight every early-stage company that might be eligible for charitable capital but instead to close vesting Kleiss best-in-class examples that others will want to follow with or without prime in the future I won't go into detail on these businesses or our down selection process to choose them right now but i will say that I've come up with a think our team has come up with a pretty creative annual funnel that leaves us being able to say that we've looked at as comprehensive as possible a registry of us-based early-stage businesses across energy agriculture waste and water and that our short list is optimized for huge climate impact potential commercial potential and additionality we just wouldn't be able to do this work without the vibrant startup ecosystem in the you including groups like arpa-e and others that support early-stage energy companies so in conclusion here's a short list of ways that you can be proactive in working with prime or seeking support from philanthropic investors like the ones we've discussed today let me start by level settings about everybody's fear of missing out this type of investment is not happening at scale yet whenever I talk to entrepreneurs I always suggest not spinning your wheels and trying to raise tons of money from the philanthropy community quite yet only because I know as a company founder time is your most precious commodity and you're going to drive yourself nuts trying to figure out different types of philanthropist and if you know one foundation you know exactly one foundation so team prime will be here driving ourself nuts for you in the meantime you should make sure you're in the prime registry which you can do by filling out a short form on our website we'll also be posting tools in the months to come to help you construct your own argument for charitable ax t without parental and then in the coming year we're planning to start in-person training sessions for entrepreneurs and partnerships with our pipeline partners like incubators accelerators business plan competitions and universities if you do find yourself talking to one of the organization's I mentioned earlier whether it's a foundation a donor-advised fund like grant making public charity a family office please get in touch with us at prime we saw one of the most useful things we can do is make introductions between philanthropist so whoever you're talking to can talk to someone that's done a deal with us already for peer-to-peer validation and they can share Jeff scrubbed legal agreements to try and reduce transaction costs and all types of benefits of peer-to-peer learning and lastly Scott burger on x team is our director of operations he's based in Boston and he's the best point of contact it within our organization for companies and pipeline partners he manages the whole side of our operation and he's really nice so please reach out and with that I will hand it back to Nate for a little Q&A alright thank you very much there for the great overview of PR is as they relate to clean energy investment and climate solutions as well as the as the update on the progress that the prime Coalition has made and the aspirations that it has so we've got a few minutes here for questions that I like to pose to both of our panelists and I think the first one is is that you know as these new investment vehicles are popping up you know give us your sense of how much they're needed and you know I guess the cause of that is you know related to clean energy investments is there a persistent capital gap where is this kind of a transient thing David I can go first if you like ya know Sarah I think you should okay great so I think this is definitely a persistent gap so let me start by saying that I think criticizing the traditional venture capital industry and its performance and cleantech over the past decade is kind of unproductive and I bet I think a little bit in precise you know in most cases 10-year closed-ended venture funds are not organizationally suited for the type of companies that can make the biggest difference on the social problems that we care about in the philanthropy community you know fund managers have promised twenty percent IRR to their LP us not to solve social problems and that doesn't necessarily make them the bad guys with the advent of companies that are acquired for over a billion dollars in less than five years for relatively small investment amounts the goalposts have moved for traditional VC to succeed in the 21st century so as you can tell by taking a look at primes investment committee we believe the venture capitalists are an integral part of a community of investors that have to work together for climate change mitigation to happen at scale and their expertise can be really valuable to philanthropists who want to make sure they're being thoughtful and additive so there's lots of lessons learned from VCS and they want and are willing to share them Prime we work really hard to make sure we're not crowding out commercial investors we're making investments that won't you know we're not making investments that won't actually achieve our charitable goals and that we're not wasting precious philanthropic capital that could make a meaningful difference in many people of lives in other ways beyond supporting energy companies so that's a long way to say I think this was definitely a persistent gap that's not going anywhere but I'm hopeful that this group of asset owners is a potential solution and I'll this is nate but i will just you know it was kind of a leading question but i will echo that you know we at our PE believe that it's a persistent and entrenched capital gap and are encouraged that more sources are coming in you know i don't think there's that strong of a risk to crowd out a lot of capital because really we need more capital coming in to ensure that we have many multiples of shots on goal as we develop a new pipeline and technologies that can ultimately scale so kind of maybe backing up a little bit just given the persistence of the capital gap and the need to get a lot of entrepreneurs to start companies and then to scale and then to create kind of a virtuous exit cycle and then you know compare and contrast that with the limited number of PR is that have been made since the 70s and specifically those focused on science and engineering and energy problems talk to us a little bit about how scalable you think pris maybe generally for you David and then applicable to energy Sarah and when I think of scalable you know both in terms of total capital and number of deals and I think you know we've made great progress and a couple great test beds but I think the reality is that you know we've only done two or at least the prime Coalition is has done two deals and give us some evidence about why you think these are going to be a growing trend well I can just say more generally amazing just echo Sarah you know venture capital is not the only form of capital that we should be looking at that as Sarah mentioned there's various structural limitations on what venture can-can indefinite and likewise PR eyes are not the only form of charitable capital I Sarah talked about in her presentation for example there's a new crop of philanthropic investors who decided to forego the traditional foundation structure and Oh for what are effectively LLC's that do charitable investment so the the one that got a lot of attention recently was the Cham ducker Berg initiatives of Mark Zuckerberg facebook founder but the Omidyar Network has been structured that way for for quite a while and there's a growing number of others and they don't have the same IRS restrictions that the foundation cab and therefore they can be more flexible and in particular you know that I think that in this case the the tenor is the is the key thing can you know what are the structures that can have a longer time horizon for the payoff of those investments and so you know there's also a new set of structures around holding companies that don't look to exit as quickly as adventure fantastic so I think it's quite a lot of financial innovation and structure innovation that can be brought to bear on the skill we would David that there's no shortage of ventures but you know are ready for this type of support it really is the readiness of the philanthropy community to hop hop to so for example to Stewart prime our registry of just us-based companies across energy agriculture waste and water and only pre-commercial seed in series eight stage businesses we assess eighteen hundred companies that's part of what makes this so hard for philanthropists because it's nearly impossible not only to decipher good investment from bad investment so they can actually know that the investment could get to scale and achieve their philanthropic goals but among the good investment which ones are a fit for philanthropic intervention versus those that would thrive without philanthropy so that's something that we've have tried to set up prime to be helpful with but based on the philanthropy numbers I went through earlier in the presentation if we could capture even a few basis points of annual grant making across various charitable asset owner types I mean we could very soon eclipsed the entire venture capital industry in the US well great I think that's both you know that's inspiring but also you know sets the gauntlet for where we need to move with with philanthropic communities to challenge the venture capital community I say that in jest but you know to complement the venture capital community I think we like I said we need we need more sources coming in with different variants to the space if we're going to scale so you know thinking about the large scale and kind of capital intensive cycles of energy hardware and Sarah you know you you you showed on your initial graph of where prime plays in the energy technology development cycle can you talk about where you think filmed philanthropists can kind of get the best bang for their buck as they relate to energy technologies you know are there are there specific investment opportunities that have a greater catalyzing effect or should it really be let's test the waters and early-stage innovation prototype scale up and large-scale demo great question lights out by saying that I think innovation and deployment are both critical to achieving our climate change mitigation goals for philanthropist I think the stage that will be able to get people to move has to do with impact risk that the philanthropist themselves are willing to take on combined with the capital requirement of the stage in question so in other words there's a perception that early stage opportunities have a lower likelihood of achieving the impact that somebody wants but that later stage opportunities require more money than most philanthropists have available to put to work today so at prime we're hoping that by working together and bringing together coalition's of philanthropist we can overcome both of those concerns to get great deals done that give everyone involved outstanding bang for their buck like the two early-stage examples that we've done already and others that we have in the pipeline for the 2016 docket so for us I think we're hoping the kind of first thing to move will leave the early-stage opportunities just in terms of check size and because those are really high-risk high-reward could make a huge difference on the charitable purposes and then if we get enough around the table with dolls philanthropic capital ready to go I think there is opportunity for philanthropic capital to also play in the later stage opportunities down the road well thanks and David anything to add from other sectors and pris about where you know what investments can have a catalyzing effect well I think there are examples in other categories but I would actually want to just come back on the energy case because there are a group of leading foundations and there's various sort of consortium meetings going on to catalyze additional capital in energy innovation I think both on early-stage ends and on deployment and so I know the MacArthur Foundation the Packard Foundation the Schmidt Family Foundation which is eric smith of google fame the more the Moore Foundation and others have been working to try to overcome this this capital gap and so I would say that this is something that where we'll start to see more news in the in the coming year and and frankly it's you know it's a it's a leadership question you know more generally I mean it's a persistent capital gap under current market conditions but you know there's the risk of getting slightly political you know price on carbon and other kinds of policy changes would would go a long way towards creating a more favorable investment climate as well great well I've got two more questions the first is for Sarah and the second is for both of you you know and the first one relates kind of specifically the energy in as we talked about the different pools of capital coming into clean energy and there's a lot of different entities that have been announced from you know not just the prime coalition but groups like the aligned intermediary and the Bill Gates led breakthrough Energy Coalition that you know promised big checks are big fun sizes later on the road you know where do you think that those can have an impact and how do they either complement or compete with prime oh man I see every effort in this field as important and necessary and you know based on the numbers that we presented early this is a huge sandbox with tons of room for lots of people to play and you know the align intermediary actually launched out of prime to serve a different type of asset owner in the same way that Prime has designed intermediation for philanthropic investors the aligned intermediary is designing intermediation for large institutional investors like universities pension funds sorry university endowments pension funds sovereign wealth funds and so I think not only our efforts like that necessary but it will only enliven the whole ecosystem along the innovation and deployment pipeline to get more smart people thinking about these these capital gaps so I think yeah I think there's not is not competitive at all and in fact we need more voices in the choir working together with bringing bringing in people that have capital on the sidelines that are not yet participating in the types of investments that we're discussing here today I very much agree we just need those entities to start deploying their capital so we're wrapping up near the end have time for essentially one more question I want to pose it to both of our presenters and I think you both did an excellent job kind of summarizing key lessons for both yeah both philanthropists and entrepreneurs as they relate to as they seek philanthropic related investments but you know I always think it's good to reiterate a couple points and so I want to leave you all with the last word of what high-level lessons do want to leave with early-stage entrepreneurs and what lessons you want to leave with philanthropists foundations etc I'll jump in i think the lesson is for entrepreneurs is that you know a mission-driven enterprise has various kinds of advantages i mean people have talked obvious about the retention and recruitment and talents advantages in having a social environmental mission and i just want to say there may be you know capital advantages as well as I mentioned earlier about ability to access different pools of capital that may be either high risk or longer return or what have you and then I would say for the foundations you know they're there is a lot of expertise developing about how to deploy capital in very much more strategic and innovative ways and it's clear that some conditions don't have the internal resources or staffing or capacity to do that but there are all kinds of groupings now where that kind of capital Kim find a can find allies and can co investors and some of the heavy lifting can be done by by others if the if the funders are willing to do it and frankly prime is a is a prime example of that and there are other there are other groupings as well so i don't think the logistics and legality it should be a hindrance to folks who want to now see whether they can leverage their capital and more strategic ways for these kind of areas I think those are great answers my answer would be to entrepreneurs I'm sorry that this isn't happening yet but there are a lot of smart people that are working on it so stay tuned and then for philanthropists we now know that there's a whole bunch of ways to deploy your grant and charitable capital into early stage energy innovation and that there are really smart experienced people with battle wounds to share lessons learned that want to help you get in the game and so I would just encourage you to reach out to Prime you know so that we can get to know your interest and be as helpful as we have to possibly can well that's a great conclusion one a big thanks to both of you David banks the founder of impact alpha and Sarah cure need founder and executive director of prime thanks so much for taking the time and sharing your expertise today
