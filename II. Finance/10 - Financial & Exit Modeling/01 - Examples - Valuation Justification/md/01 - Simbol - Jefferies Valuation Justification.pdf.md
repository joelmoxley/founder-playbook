Valuation Drivers
Lithium Prices (LiOH)
* Rising demand for both Li2CO3 and LiOH
* Persistent scarcity of LiOH
* Expanding price premium of LiOH over Li2CO3
* Peers’ current technology cannot meet large EV manufacturer demand for quality LiOH

Discount Rate
* Capital asset pricing model supported by established Li players
  * Simbol is better than most early stage companies that have both scale up and technology risk
* Research analysts such as Laurence Alexander (Jefferies) and Patrick Archambault (Goldman Sachs) often value innovative industrial tech companies in the 13-15% range

Multiples
* Supported by several trading comparables sets:
* Lithium Producers
* Rockwood trading at 14x ’15E EBITDA
* SQM at 10.2x ’15 EBITDA, its best business is Li
* Supported by Simbol’s growth and margin profile

Technology / Execution
* Superior proprietary extraction technology for LiOH
* Benefits from co-location
* Shovel ready engineering design, supported by over 9,000 hours of operations
* Secure access to the world’s second largest brine resource
* Plant and working capital financing already secured at a below-market interest rate, with contingencies for additional capital costs built in
* Committed current owners, with strong strategic back-up from highly credible Itochu (plant financing, supply agreements)

LiOH Pricing Drivers
Lithium Prices (LiOH)
* Rising demand for both Li2CO3 and LiOH
* Estimates based on large EV manufacturers' forecasts: LiOH demand is expected to grow at ~42% annually through 2025
* Persistent scarcity of LiOH
* Expanding price premium of LiOH over Li2CO3
* Limited "effective" capacity of peers

* Fundamental analysis of comparable companies 12% WACC
* Even higher-risk, early stage companies in the comp set are garnering discount rates of 13% to 15% (e.g. Solazyme, SolarCity and FuelCell)
* For example, Jefferies analyst Laurence Alexander initiated Marrone Bio Innovations (a biopesticide company) at a WACC of 15%

Comments / Rationale
Comparable Companies
Lithium & Early Stage Chem Tech
FMC
* FMC Corporation (FMC) is a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets with solutions, applications and products.
* Of FMC's 2013 lithium sales, 50% is estimated to come from carbonate, chloride and hydroxide with the remaining 50% from downstream lithium products (1)
* FMC lithium sales accounted for approximately 19% of 2013 global lithium market share by sales
* Currently trading at 11.6x 2014E TEV/EBITDA with an estimated 2014 EBITDA margin of 22.9%
* Lithium, along with agriculture and biopolymers are FMC's best businesses - overall multiple is dragged by the rest of their businesses

Rockwood
* Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (Rockwood) is a developer, manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals and advanced materials used for industrial and commercial purposes.
* In May 2014, Rockwood completed the acquisition of the ownership interest to create a joint venture with Sichuan Tianqi Lithium Industries Inc., giving Rockwood a 49% ownership interest in Talison Lithium Pty Ltd
* Rockwood is the best comparable because former CEO Seifi Ghasemi has always spent the majority of his investor relations presentations focused around lithium
* Rockwood is currently trading at 16.1x 2014E TEV/EBITDA with an estimated 2014E EBITDA margin of 23.5%

SQM 
* Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA (SQM) is a Chile-based company engaged in the production of specialty plant nutrients and chemicals commodities.
* SQM currently has the highest EBITDA margin of the top four global lithium suppliers, at 35.2%, however, corporate tax in Chile is likely to increase from 20% to 25% after the fiscal reform currently pending approval at congress, which may place some downward pressure on the Company's future Net Income margin
* The bulk of SQM's business is commodity minerals - even their lithium product is commodity and the Company has no ability to produce hydroxide
* In 2013, SQM produced approximately 25% of the global lithium supply
* SQM is trading at the middle of our lithium producers and suppliers comparable set with an 11.5x 2014E TEV/EBITDA
