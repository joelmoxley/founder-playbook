Comment
Always think in (and present!) absolute years, not "year 1, year 2â€¦"
Enter from your business plan. Check revenue ramp against comps for plausibility


Reality-check against comparables to ensure that your gross margin is plausible
Enter from your business plan. Start-ups tend to always underestimate opex!

Reality-check against comparables to ensure that your EBIT margin is plausible
Enter the size of the round that you expect to raise in this year
Enter the pre-money valuation of the round you think you can get for the round
Enter the amount of this year's round done by investor you're modeling

Note early-stage VCs typically target 20% and invest at pro rata to maintain it
Enter based on comparables. OK to presume some premium for growth

Reality-check against comparables. >20x = rare for mature enterprise
Should be >= 10% of model VC's fund size by end of period; otherwise "too small"
An early-stage VC will look for 10x by the end if everything goes right
