Taking technology to the next level means navigating a confusing range of financing options: venture capital, angel investors, government grants, bank loans, and many more. Matthew Nordan explains the different types of capital available to early stage technologists, what each looks for to make an investment decision, and what they want in return.

our faiz objective as its as it stated is developing and deploying disruptive technologies so Arun Majumdar he moved out to DC in 2009 after being a deputy director at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and being an engineering professor for four decades and within his first month of being in DC he was kind of put through the ropes and brought up to the hill to talk to a bunch of congressional members about RP so the the briefing went very well started off very well with him talking about all the great stuff that you guys are doing until he used the words and deploying disruptive technologies a term that's pretty common for a lot of scientists certainly for business people disruptive technologies but disruptive technologies for folks on the hill was synonymous with destructive and so kind of the red belt the alarm started ringing the red flags were raised and an onslaught of questions started coming at him and so a room very quickly learned to use things like game-changing and breakthrough technologies rather than disruptive ie you know he he learned rule number one which is you need to understand your audience and how they see the world otherwise you were talking past them and not being able to season an opportunity so today's panel on demystifying capital is essentially talking about how do finance sears see the world and we have matthew modine from venrock capital here to help in talking about been translating how coppola providers think and speak specifically he will discuss some of the nuances of each of the subcultures of capital providers what did similarities what are the differences between how angel investors venture capitalist private equity firms commercial veins see energy technology and as a result one and how should you as a technologist utilize and talk to each one of them and I can't think of a better person to talk through this then Matt he's a vice president at then rock capital which is a premier VC firm I'm sure many of you are familiar with it is the Rockefeller family as venture venture arm however matt is actually pretty new to the VC world having spent more than ten years focused on science driven innovation and he's been very successful in the energy finance world because he's become a really great translator between technology financial markets so join me in welcoming hey everybody very good to see you all here I am indeed Matthew nor deny do indeed hail from venrock our firm has been backing energy innovators in the US for literally decades going back to the first lithium-based battery in 1977 on the first dig geothermal energy producer in 1980 but I've only been in this line of work for about two years now that's long enough to understand how it works from the inside out it is not so long thankfully for this presentation to have lost one sense of ironic detachment so I hope that today I can speak to you as much from the perspective of a VC as from my previous life we're with very talented cofounders of you know i co-founded inlet a startup company than information services company and a true start up the time where you come home of your spouse and say honey I know we've got that mortgage and the second baby's on the way that I am going to take a huge pay cut and I hope you don't like dental insurance because we're not going to have it it's okay to laugh laughing is good here we go rise up with leather so I thought that you know we could have a good discussion today about different forms of finance that you can use to take your technology and build it into a world-beating startup but I also thought that we could just play the legend because they're actually some astonishing parallels between the two you're in a poorly understood environment don't have a lot of direction I can be frustrating if you've done it before but it can be something more like inscrutable if you never have you keep coming up against bigger and bigger challenges and when you face them the things that have served you well in the past don't seem to work an issue is not that you don't have tools available that you have tons of true the trick is be able to pick the right one that gets the desired effect which is not always obvious it's not until you're able to size the situation off and understand what you're up against then you can make the right choice and then when you get a little closer so with that in mind let's dive into it there's one point I want to get to before we dive through each source of capital and that is to be confident in yourself I wish somebody would have told me up front when I started doing this because I had this conception the stereotype that financial types were invisible superheroes from outer space somehow capable of something I was not and I'll tell you at every turn that illusion has been shattered the truth is fragile humans are all the world can hold and when you're up against someone else on the other side of a boardroom table who seems to have more power or influence than you you need to get inside that head and always see the 2world from the other person's point of view when you do that you can understand what motivates them you can understand where their weak points are and you're much more likely to achieve your goal in the end so we need a kind of structure for thinking about sources of finance kind of like a tree of life I'm going to use the tree of startup financing with three major branches selling stock in your company equity of having somebody pay you to sell them something or do something for them revenue and then all forms of debt which is fairly self-explanatory you're going to hear is a theme throughout this talk none of these things are good or bad none as better or worse than the other they're all just either purpose suited or not and they have a different trade-offs now at a macro level before we dive into each you can think about the trade-offs this way we've got these three forms of financing you can think about whether they are diluted whether they are delayed you can't access them until later than you'd like or they distract you from your mission and then whether you have to pay the money back now all these terms should be office obvious except possibly dilution dilution is giving up part of the pie offer a size of pie trade-off so if you and I start a startup company you own half and I own half and we have to go out and raise five million bucks from somebody and we're going to sell him or her twenty percent of the company well we now own forty percent so we were deluded by the twenty percent that we sold to someone now why on earth would you do that well if we sold twenty percent of the company for five million dollars how much does that imply its worth thank you 25 million that's right the only reason we would do this is if getting that money caused the size of the pie to get much bigger than 25 million dollars it would enable us to be able to have the right trade off and having a smaller slice of a bigger pie so when you look at these three forms of financing the downside of equity of selling shares is its diluted however you get the money right now and you get it in order to execute exactly what's in your business plan it shouldn't be distracting you also don't have to pay it back revenue has a different trade off it's not diluted that's wonderful but depending on its form it either may only be available to you after you need it or may distract you from your plan you don't however have to pay it back then finally there's debt which like the mortgage on your house it's not diluted to you it you get it right then and once you get the money you can use it for whatever you'd like however you do have to pay it back and also just like the mortgage on your house you can't pay it back the bank takes your house if you can't pay this back the bank can take your business so with that in mind let's go through each of these in some detail I'm going to start with equity because I think there's a sort of default view that America has encouraged of entrepreneurs and it is that if you want to build a big successful independent company you have to take equity financing specifically you have to take the institutional kind from professional investors like the firm that I work at right when we think about apple or Tesla Motors or Facebook they all took institutional equity money and in many cases several hundreds of millions of dollars of it however this is wrong there are plenty of other ways that you can build a successful independent even energy in our environmental business this data here is based on a set i had just available to me it's showing you all the 65 companies that went public anywhere in the world at any valuation on a stock exchange in energy and environment from 95 through and as you can see only a little bit more than half of them raised institutional equity financing arrested but you can see at the right the essential trade-off here those that did take equity financing for professional investors got to the finish line about two times as fast and although I don't have the data it's not quite as Queen so haven't presented it here as best I can tell they also had about two times bigger evaluation at the time they went public so they had a smaller slice of the pie but it was two times a bigger pie and they got eight to eat it twice as early right so there are lots of sources for equity financing I'm going to go through four of them at a really high level you know first and foremost is friends and family you all probably have people in your networks who have access to some appreciable amount of money and might get it to you based on your personal relationship alone the next is angel investors generally retired executives from startups or corporate environments they tend to invest in the tens of thousands to maybe the low millions on the basis of an early business plan next is venture capitalists people like me they tend to invest in the millions of dollars up to maybe 20 million that would be a very large check from one VC unlike the friends and family and the angels that your capital investors aren't investing their own money they're investing money from other people called limited partners generally pension funds foundations and trusts who give them the money and expect it back with profits in some time frame and as a result they have a higher burden of proof for making an investment they don't want to see an early plan they want to see a polished one it should be accompanied in most cases by some proof of concept whether it's experimental data or a prototype device then after that their growth equity investors there are a lot of similarities here with the venture folks but also some differences one of them being size of check 10 million dollars would be a small check from a growth equity investor 100 million dollars is as high as they might go and their key motivation is to invest in nothing with substantial risk the product should already work the customers should already be in place the technology working is out of a question it should be a foregone conclusion people often talk about these sources of financing this early stage or late stage the reason I've cut this down the middle of venture capital is that it's the most flexible box in this sequence while growth equity investments are very stereotyped angel investments are typical in size vc's may make things that look more like one or more like the other they have a broader continuum then finally there is a time scale on this from the venture box outward if friends and family angel investors are investing their own money it's up to them right when that produces a return and how big that return is but the venture capital and growth equity investors got their money from other sources who expect it back with profits in some time frame and for the venture capitalists ninety-nine percent of the time that's ten years they operate what are called ten-year closed-ended funds so there's a clock ticking on the process and if your company doesn't fit in a ten-year box now it's probably too early for you to take venture capital investment so let's talk about each of these in turn in a bit more detail if you want to understand how to get money from these folks you need to understand the reward system and we can start with friends and family but this actually would not be a bad family to get money from probably a lot of money may be easy to suspend this belief could be a good choice well I will spend very little time on this the key distinguishing factor of friends and family investors are that they're people who trust you implicitly and will invest for a non-financial reason love friendship bragging rights that they've supported a buddy from college the key thing to point out here is that when you negotiate and it's really not negotiation its please give me some money a friends and family investment you're typically only talking about the amount invested and you're not typically talking about what percentage of the company it buys these investments are almost always done is what's called a convertible note now if that's not a term you're familiar with your at the very beginning of just concept stage of a company right and I'm going to go to you there the third in the front row and I'm going to ask you for fifty thousand dollars how much of the company should that by I did not script him uh it's too early to know right so a convertible note is a way of cheating you're going to buy shares in the company that you're not going to decide how many now you're going to leave that until later when it's more clear how much the company is worth so you use this when the valuation is impossible to agree agree on usually very early but sometimes later when the company's right in the middle in between two milestones that would connote value and a convertible note is alone like most loans it almost always has interest associated with it and it converts into ownership of shares at some unspecified later time when money will be raised with a price attached to it so to give you an example let's say that in January of this year I write you one hundred K convertible note at ten percent interest January next year you go out and raise money you sell shares I maybe to a venture capital firm you raise 2.2 million dollars including my note that buys half the company implying the company's worth 4.4 million now my convertible note converts into stock that's worth 910 k / 4.4 million equals two and a half percent of the company there's no feasible way we could have agreed on that at such an early stage the second group of investors also tend to invest in the form of convertible notes more often than not they are angel investors angel investors are pretty diverse for example there's a group in Boston called clean energy Venture Group a band of angels that is not only the most active group of angel investors in energy and environmental startups but the most active investor period in terms of number of companies they invest in orange juice onus is a wealthy telecom executive who has put money into companies particularly out of MIT Bill Gates you probably already know while angel investors are kind of motivated by profit they don't want to lose money it tends to be more of a tertiary motivation that the primary one is that with your retired guy or gal you want to have fun and you can have fun on a yacht you can have fun on the tennis court but you can also have fun mentoring people at an earlier stage of their business life whose mission aligned with and that tends to be the key motivation of angel investors as a result that follows that while you score jacks or better you've got to have a good idea and a good business plan to get their interest their decision will probably be made more on chemistry with you and on personal alignment with your mission when you negotiate an angel deal the first sort of decision tree is are you buying shares at a price or a convertible note if shares you'll decide about valuation if a note you'll decide about the term but you'll also probably have a discount rate attached to it now why is that imagine that you're an angel you're investing a higher amount of money you're a little bit more sophisticated investor you know you're putting money in when there's less certainty about the business and it's going to convert into ownership later when there's more certainty you took more risk right by investing here rather than here so you might say I want to discount so if the shares are going to cost a buck right when my note converts I want a 20-percent discount on that you know mine will be eighty cents that's a very typical angel negotiation next on the list let's go to the place I spend my life these days which is in venture capital i SAT when I was preparing this and thought how can I show these folks you know what venture capitalists they might negotiate with or likely to look like so i went to the websites of five prominent energy venture capital firms and i took the head shots of all the partners and put them on the slide you're going to see so you can see that statistically you are most likely to be talking with a white male in a blue shirt right um would like to get more diversity into this asset class venture capitalist has mentioned this is where we cross the dividing line from people investing their own money to professional investors investing other people's money there are many kinds of VC some focus only on energy like Bray mar others do the same and are very small and do more angelite deals like terawatt ventures others invest in health care and IT and all sorts of things like Morde avid ow there's no common previous career thread for VCS you'll find x entrepreneurs and lifetime investor and ex government people what I do think is a connecting thread because you're investing in things where you're sort of dreaming with your feet on the ground and envisioning what a business could look like far in the future it tends to attract kind of eccentric people in one way or another you know some sort of rough edge bombastic personality their motivation is primarily profit there's some personal mission that it's mostly profit and in particular being able to envision getting at least ten times your money back on what you invest you might think for a minute that's kind of crazy right you said these venture funds run tenure funds they're getting money from tension funds and others who would most likely put their money in the stock market which returns eight percent a year you don't need to make ten times your money back in ten years to be eight percent return right you need like two times your money well the problem is most of these investments fail in a typical VC portfolio half the investments return zero dollars they fail completely three or four of them maybe you okay and return 1 times the money that was invested only maybe one or two will be big breakout successes and when you jiggle all that math together to beat the stock market you can't invest in anything where you can envision at an early stage this 10x return as a result the key to the heart of a venture capitalist and a pitch meeting is being able to paint a picture of your business as a large independent candidate for going public or being bought at a big valuation company that could achieve that 10 * return if you can't articulate that when you're honest with yourself then it's probably telling you something about your fundraising strategy and about needing to seek different vehicles these these are more professional investors they will negotiate valuation with you they will sometimes do convertible notes but rarely they'll negotiate about do they have seats on the board what votes are required for different changes in the business lastly well one of the point on bc's are there are people who are not venture capital firms who nonetheless make investments with the same size time frame and return expectation as VCS sometimes these are corporations who make these investments so that they can get close to companies that they might want to acquire or partner with on the road or more nefariously to learn about a potential competitor that's common second our family offices so these are groups that invest only the money of one very wealthy family that's how venrock started out is the family office for the Rockefeller family black coral is a prominent one the others there are no logos because they tend to fly under the radar they don't want a thousand people knocking on the door with business plans they want to carefully go out and select through their networks the ones they want to invest in madrone for example is the family office of the walton family of wal-mart thing and finally there are super angels who are like angel investors only more super meaning that they can invest much larger sums of money over longer periods of time the gentleman you see at the left there is jr simplot an Idaho Potato billionaire I'm not making this up who independently backed micron technology in the semiconductor realm and more recently almost solely back semi LEDs which went public and LED lighting about a year ago Bill Gates probably no Vulcan capital is the Super Angel arm of Gates's Microsoft co-founder paul allen that is invested for example in nuclear technology super angels you may find will be willing to consider more technically aggressive speculative projects than conventional vc investors night so you know I pointed out beforehand that is a venture capital investor you are trying to place a value with a return expectation on a company that won't rise to publicly recognized prominence until much later I liken it to trying to pick the NBA draft pick by watching 8th graders play basketball and then coming back at eight years and seeing if you were right right now the subject of study will change a lot between now and then so you can't you know look at the eighth grade Kobe Bryant and think what am I looking for is this the great player you can only look for proxies for latent brilliance that will emerge later on I think you'll find venture capitalists tend to think about three sub proxies technology market and team it was interesting that the discussion before hand went right down to these three on the earlier room on technology every domain has a learning curve where the price for performance of the existing solutions tend to be getting a little better every year and if you're going to say you have say a 2x better advantage on some critical dimension but you're going to be in market in five years by the time you get there your advantage may have been competed away so as a result venture capitalists look for a really big advantage now and the dumb mental shortcut they will do is an order of magnitude better on some dimension ten times better price ten times better power density team times better something else now you guys are smart enough to know in many energy domains that's not relevant in biofuels I don't care what synthesis process you're using you're not going to come up with 40-cent gasoline right but you need to be aware of this 10x bias and if you can't find something in your pitch right that is  be barking up the wrong tree the same thing goes with market where venture capitalists want to see a big market  that could support a company with big revenues and be worth a really big valuation the mental shortcut that's used often is is it a billion-dollar market if it's less than that maybe that's a proxy for not being big enough now again there are a lot of cases where that's not the right thinking the market may be small now it will be big later it may be small now but you can dominate all of it just be aware of the bias so you know which buttons to push then finally there's the team the first line there is repeated three times for a reason the CEO of a company is that company encapsulated and judgments by professional investors will be made about the entire company broad sweeping judgments based on very small interactions you know an hour or less with that CEO if the CEO is late to the meeting the company's disorganized if the CEO is able to articulate points brilliantly the company has amazing sales and marketing expertise again it may not be right a hundred percent of the time but it's a good enough proxy to help folks make good decisions and you should be aware of it and think very carefully about who you put at the front the frontman of the band designated as the business leader last category of equity to go to is growth equity this again is professional investors investing other people's money but with different contours two good examples in energy would be Hudson clean energy partners and silverlake kraftwerk some venture firms have a growth equity arm so kleiner perkins for example has a green growth fund that does only these kinds of investments if VCS are best characterized as kind of advisors or business partners who happen to have a checkbook they're not that sophisticated investors growth equity investors are the opposite they are really people who are investors first and foremost who happen to be doing that in technology or energy as a secondary point they tend to be much heavier on numbers and on spreadsheets and to do much deeper diligence on your company they are playing the same game of trying to be eight percent stock our cat returns as the VCS but if the VCS are trying to do that over eight to ten years with a 10x return that works out to the right annualized rate of return these guys are trying to get 3x in two to five years so smaller return that shorter amount of time equals a similar internal rate of return and as you can imagine you're not going to see that return in that amount of time unless you're investing in a business that is all down to execution where the technology works and the customers are their growth equity investors are also much more sophisticated and they're much better at being able to author investment terms that favor them even if something goes wrong so with a venture investor you may be arguing as you see at the bottom row here you know how much money are you going to invest and what percent of the company does it by with a growth equity investor they're likely to be strings attached one of those might be well I'm going to invest 30 million dollars and by fifteen percent of the company but when the company gets sold depending on the price I want to get three times my investment so 90 million dollars back before anybody else gets anything now that's called a preference in this case a 3x preference they might even then say and after i get my three times i want fifteen percent of everything that's left over after that too that's called participation you're unlikely to see those terms in a venture deal you are pretty likely to see them in a growth equity deal your mission when you are equity financing your startup is to make sure the valuation of your company always goes up at every round you want to do that for two reasons one of them is that every time you raise money you dilute yourself the later stage the company the more money you're likely raising so you need the price to always get higher so that taking on bigger amounts of money doesn't dilute you infinitely but there's a second reason that applies only to you when professional investors buy shares and affirm they typically by what's known as preferred stock and that is what it sounds like it's thought that has special rights and preferences above and beyond others the management team and the founders typically on what's called common stock now but preferred shares over here typically have what's attached to them called an anti-dilution clause and what it says in brief is that if the company's valuation ever goes down so you raise money here than at this evaluation than here atheneum to raise down here right that really dilute severy buddy but these guys get extra shares minted out of thin air that at least partially makes them whole the common shareholders that would be you or me when I was an entrepreneur don't get that protection so in one of these rounds where you raise at a lower price what's called a down round you get whacked twice once by the dilution but then a second time by the anti-dilution provisions now there are some successful companies that avoid this this is a chart showing you the share price with such a proxy for valuation of the biofuel company g fo every time it raises money always went up right all the way to the IPO incredibly well executed financing strategy this is a one two three systems which also have money going up share price going up every single time till they thought they were going to go public they weren't able to do that they had to raise additional money to cover the losses in the business then made a second successful run at an IPO but that last time they raised money it was down about a third from the previous price that would have been very painful for the management team and the founders who held common stock all right let's equity now let's move on to revenue we're going to talk about three sources here that are very diverse the first of which is cash flow so this is people paying you money for something that you sell them or something that you do for them I think you can probably imagine what the challenges of cash flow financing and energy or environment startup are let's say that you're going to make a desalination membrane rightand at some point you will be able to sell the membrane for more money than it cost you to make it you'll take the gross profit from that sale and you'll use it to grow the business to start the next product or higher the next engineer the problem is that you can't access cash flow funding and until you've already built the product and gotten the customers and that's what you need the money to do so cash flow financing is the best source of money for your company but it's often very delayed until you can access it there are some exceptions we're going to go to one exception at the very end of this talk and some examples I had one of these exceptions in a previous life where I was leaving an information services business focused on energy and environment but that sold data and advice on a subscription basis and we could get customers to sign up for a subscription and pay us on net 30-day terms for something we would deliver over the course of the year and as you can see if you could get enough of them to sign up before you started really delivering the product you could completely finance it before you incurred any cost otherwise won't talk much about cash flow financing it should be pretty straightforward the second I also won't talk about much grants because we are after all a tan arpa-e conference implying that most of you know a lot about this financing mechanism more than I will ever know you understand the program managers on the other side of the table you know what motivates them you write a great proposal and you quibble over project scope and milestones so i won't go into that into detail i will however spend some time on in re you might say what that stands for yes non-recurring engineering services which is what it sounds like it's money you get once not for making an object but for performing a task for doing a service for someone else an NRI is you know taking money from corporations generally to make something for them based on your technology and for the making you're going to get a fee as opposed to just earning their trust or something else let me give you an example of this you can have an idea of how it can go right and can go wrong so there is a company that we're very close to advan rocket as a platform technology that's applicable to a lot of different markets and they have a very clear strategy that is to start threading the needle through market a build customer based revenue and cash flow in that market and then expand to DC D and E and years down the road now a company came to them a corporation and said hey we're actually interested in your technology now for application d so although it's not what you're doing right now we like you and we'll pay you to do it to develop a version of your technology oriented toward our application and do that now and we're going to pay you two million dollars over the course of 18 months to do that now as you can imagine the CEO and the management team considered this in great detail that's two million dollars with all of the accompanying dilution at an early stage when you get diluted by a lot but they're not going to have to raise from equity investors now because we've already invested we're lined with them we want them to get non diluted financing as much as they can we got diluted to UM then what happened they decided okay we think we're going to go forward they had a series of negotiations with the corporation over months and it resulted in I don't have it with me but you know this 20 25 page document page after page of legal clauses of definition scope terms milestones the CEO spent many meetings on this the the technical team did as well and you know what by the time they got to the end they decided man we can't agree with this corporation about two things about you know on one hand the IP rights that would come would they co-owned this invention with us or do we own it by ourselves and then secondly about the exclusivity they want it to be exclusive for them for 20 years we don't want that we wanted to be able to sell it to another company in a year or two and it ended up being probably you know not a constructive use of time ought to go down the Centauri road so that's what can bite you there's a lot of money available here the aerospace and defense contractors like Lockheed Martin are the world's biggest providers of NRI but while companies do this incumbent technology companies do this on your typically dealing with somebody in innovation or product development who's trying to solve a problem and they think they can solve that more cheaply and faster by having you develop your technology for it than by doing it themselves there may also be kind of nefarious motives then they want to stay close to you to keep tabs on you if you compete they may think it's better to know more about you rather than less and if the prices that is two million dollars awesome the key to the heart is having a great technology and exclusivity but you're going to argue you're going to argue over the scope the milestones their IP rights the exclusivity and it may not pay off I think you can see from that example it really applies to all of these your revenue financing mission is don't get distracted so if a government agency is willing to write you a grant for something that is your business plan with no modification awesome take that money all day long if it's a grant to do something that's kind of peripheral related to the mission it brings you some money but it doesn't help you develop your product you should be much more cautious the same thing applies to NRI or to selling someone a product cash flow financing that is not what you're really trying to accomplish in the business certain final category is debt debt comes in many forms we're not going to cover them all but I'll go through a couple and we'll take it from there so let's say that you're going to buy a house you're going to get a mortgage right what is the bank's security on that loan if you can't pay what do they get the house absolutely so for each of these three forms of debt we're going to talk about there is a different type of security and the first one is the one where the security is least obvious it's venture debt so you're an early stage startup company you are maybe even still ensconced in a university or you just moved out and are in a lab somewhere you have no assets so there's no equipment to take away if you can't pay the loan and you have no purchase orders so there's no customer that the bank yet in between them and you and take the checks if you can pay how on earth could you get alone well that is what venture debt is actually designed to do it comes from specialty debt providers people like Silicon Valley Bank and comerica some big banks do this as well Wells Fargo recently reentered this business you're dealing with a banker and like all forms of debt they are interested in profit and profit and profit that's the point if you've ever been on the sort of loan officer side of things are known people you would know that you don't maximize your returns as a banker by negotiating the best interest rate or whatever those are really market-based and you have to conform plus or minus to what everybody else offers you make money by managing the risk of default so you're trying not to lend to people who have a high default risk only to win to people who have a Lowen wow that's sounds likely the room in a venture debt providers get through this with a non-obvious way they only lend to startups that are backed by institutional venture capital so the idea is the startups unlikely to fail because the VCS won't let it fail and therefore we're likely to get paid back the venture debt providers they want a profit they also want your banking business so they want you to put your deposits with them they'll use that as their source of cash to make loans to other companies and you'll argue about the interest rate about payment terms also about something called warrant coverage so venture debt lenders will get warrants they're like stock options in your company they'll come to them essentially for free with the loan if your company fails they'll never be worth anything but if you end up being Facebook those warrants will be worth a lot of money and unlike the equity investors who paid money for the stock but they'll get to sell the venture debt players will get it for free this one's a working capital line of credit Bob Wow let's say you're in the light bulb business you get a million bulb order they're going to cost you two million dollars to make you're going to sell them for four in six months right because that's how long it's going to take for them to get made to go across the river on a boat and then to come off the boat and get sold in Walmart it would be very silly for you to go out and raise two million dollars of diluted equity financing to be able to pay for making two million light bulbs and the parts that go into them right that'd be crazy you're going to have the four million dollars later you have a hard purchase order you're just only going to have in six months that's what a working capital line of credit often call the revolving line of credit hence the picture is designed to do to provide you with a cash reservoir you can draw on you can just keep dipping into it and  paying it back to cover these ups and downs in cash flow specialty providers do this big banks do unlike venture debt there's no warrant coverage there aren't any covenant swear if you don't maintain a certain bank balance you can't draw on the money tends to be much simpler and the lending rates are usually described as an uptick on the prime rate there are lots of other forms of debt there's equipment finance where someone loans you money to buy an MBE machine or a TEM and their security is the machine often in many cases the vendors themselves will arrange this financing so you can buy from them there's project finance where you pay to deploy your technology in some scheme that has referring cash flow you know like a IPP type payment and you're going to get that on recurring basis people arrange it there's long term debt which is like the mortgage on your house it's just a mortgage on a factory I won't go into these in detail the key thing to point out about all of these classes is that they really are straightforward debt investments that are like the mortgage on your house your mission with that financing and this is a little controversial it's not the standard answer you'd hear on debt but it's Matthews point of view and I would feel that I was acting inappropriately if I wasn't honest with myself and speaking with you I exhort you not to take on debt without cash flow particularly the venture debt providers that you debt will be positioned as well it's a way of you managing ups and downs of you know your cash requirements before you have checks coming in the door you can use it to optimize the time you raise equity in the two years and change that I've been in Ventura i have seen death to companies without purchase orders and cash flow go wrong easily ten times more often than it goes right there are people who thread the knee make it work but there are rare 6exceptions you would not buy a house and take out a mortgage if you didn't have a job I exhort you not to take on debt unless you have cash flow last thing to wrap up I wanted to give you three examples of real companies and show you what you know sort of financing approaches they took over time first is a company called energy recovery inc they make pressure exchanger systems that reduce the energy requirements of reverse osmosis founded 92 went public 16 years later so a long journey the business was primarily funded by revenue so even a few years in they had three or four million dollars or revenue a year and they had about a million dollars of profit and they used that small amounts every year sort of bootstrapping the business into a public company they did take some equity financing but it was not from institutional investors only Angels was 24 million dollars but over 14 years so Wes than 2 million dollars a 0year on equity money they did take on some debt but only about four million dollars in a revolving line and then one time took on a one-million-dollar equipment learn so this is an example where the timeframe from inception to outcome was quite long you didn't get to eat the pie for 16 years but by the time you did you probably had a bigger slice than you would if you had taken a lot of institutional equity financing second one Solazyme this is an algae oil and biomaterials company eight year time frame from founding to IPO primarily funded through equity and 128 million dollars of it that actually is close to the average for venture capital and growth equity money that goes into energy companies that have gone public is sort of right at the knee they did take some revenue funding in the form of a grant a 22 million dollar do a grant to build their first integrated refinery they did thread the needle on debt in a way that I exerted you not to so in 2007 four years into the business they took out a five-million-dollar a long term loan it was at almost eleven percent interest so it was very expensive money was paid off a few years later largely through some financial chicanery that I did not completely understand when I read there s one but you know hats off to them for getting under the deck lastly if Tesla Motors you probably know this company how could you not similar eight year time frame so you're seeing this for the standard number with equity-backed companies institutional equity primarily funded by debt in the form of US government loan for almost half a billion dollars to build their first big manufacturing plant they also took on equity and a lot of it almost three times as much as the typical company and energy and environment but they were also substantially funded through revenue because this is the rare example of a product category where you could get people to pay you up front at least some of the purchase price of the car months or a year before they got it on Tesla did that very successfully with the car you see in red there the Roadster and when they announced the Model X you see in the lower right just last week they announced 40 million dollars in pre-orders in 24 hours that's all money that did not have to be raised non diluted Lee and that you don't have to pay back all so hats off to them that's everything I realized this has been drinking for a firehose I don't think we have time for questions at this point I'm going to be around here for the rest of the day today and all day tomorrow please reach out to me with any questions or thought you might have would love to talk to you about these things and thank you for being here at the unit
