The presentation for an ARPA-E webinar that covers how charitable investment through organizations like the PRIME Coalition can leverage funds that can have an impact where venture capital, and other types of funding have shied away due to poor alignment in timescales and outcomes. PRIME Coalition aggregates and qualifies hard science cleantech companies looking for investment that would be well suited to philanthropic investment, and then works with its network of philanthropic groups to complete the investment.

High barriers prevent philanthropists from investing directly into early-stage ventures today – here’s what we heard during our listening tour in 2013.
I didn’t know I could use my grant dollars to make for-profit investments.
My grant team is not organizationally structured to behave like a for-profit investment firm.
I’m inundated with investment opportunities and it’s very difficult to know which might actually need philanthropic intervention.
How can I be sure that this is the best use of my philanthropy, or that a specific investment might actually help solve the climate problem?
I don’t know where to look for co-investors or follow-on investors – I don’t want to be out on a limb by myself.
Once I find a company I might want to support, I can’t convince my own accountants, attorneys and advisors to let me do it with charitable capital.
Would I potentially get in trouble with the IRS if I break the rules? How can I know with certainty that something qualifies as charitable?
I’m not a technical expert – I need support on technical due diligence. How much would that cost to do right?
I can’t find any examples of other grant-makers making investments like this in the field.
Is it true that there are good investments dying on the vine?
I thought that’s what venture capital was doing.
Quotes recorded during PRIME market research, 2013.

PRIME’s mission, vision and Theory of Change led us to focus on two core programs in the near-term:
1 facilitate demonstrative investments
2 build connectivity between philanthropists and climate innovators

PRIME’s 2016 docket was selected from 2015 Registry of 1,300 companies…
membranes that reduce the cost and energy of desalination and water treatment
meter collar that enables solar and other renewable resources to connect to the grid cheaply, safely, and rapidly
grid control software that enables efficient management of grids and microgrids
ultra-high-efficiency, low-cost solar material
affordable, distributed, carbon-free nuclear power



Ways energy innovators can be proactive in seeking philanthropic investment in the near-term:
Level set about FOMO – philanthropic investment in energy not really happening yet
Make sure you’re in the PRIME Registry via www.primecoalition.org
Check out PRIME’s tools to help you construct your own argument for ”charitability”
Attend PRIME’s in-person training sessions for entrepreneurs
Once you’re in the door with a philanthropist, come back to us – we can help with peer-to-peer validation!
