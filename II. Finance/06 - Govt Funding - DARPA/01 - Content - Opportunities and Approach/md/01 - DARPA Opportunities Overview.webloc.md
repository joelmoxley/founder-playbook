Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyWork With UsOpportunities
Opportunities
Established in 1958 as part of the U.S. Department of Defense, DARPA pursues opportunities for transformational change rather than incremental advances. It does so collaboratively as part of a robust innovation ecosystem that includes academic, corporate, and governmental partners. To fulfill its mission, the Agency relies on diverse performers from throughout this ecosystem to apply multi-disciplinary approaches to both advance knowledge through basic research and create innovative technologies that address current and predicted practical problems through applied research. The list of selected opportunities displayed below is provided for convenience. For a complete listing of DARPA opportunities please visit the FedBizOpps website. More

In addition to program-specific opportunities, each DARPA technical office maintains an “office-wide” Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) that covers a range of technical areas of interest to each particular office. The office-wide BAAs are refreshed on an annual basis and offer a mechanism for researchers to reach DARPA with ideas that they feel could be valuable to national security.
