Where is CPV’s Place in Solar?
The Importance of Efficiency
“All solar installations are area limited.”
(The value of efficiency is) “…so incredible.”
‐ Dick Swanson, CTO of SunPower
in a talk given at Stanford University, 11/29/07

Concentrated Photovoltaics (CPV)
Higher efficiency means …
more power to the user
Sol3g
Soliant Energy
Google Campus in Mountain View, CA
All rooftops & carports covered in c-Silicon fixed flat plate modules from Sharp.
Only meets 30% of their power needs.
CPV could meet 100% of their needs using the same area.
From Soliant Energy:
• High efficiency great for area constrained applications
• Optimized for the rooftop
• Same dimensions & weight as conventional solar panel
• Identical Installation
• Tracking makes peak power generation correspond to peak need tracking

The Importance of Efficiency
The WORLD is area limited
Tera‐Watts Produced vs. Area of Installation
Power consumption in USA today (3.3TW)
Area of all single family detached homes in USA
35% efficient CPV module
20% efficient c-Si module
10% efficient thin film module
% of USA covered by PV
Plot uses day & night average insolation for entire USA (200W/m2). American southwest insolation is more like 290W/m2. No tracking on c‐Si or thin film

  • > 1 GW of terrestrial CPV cells on order since 2007. Represents > $235M cell revenue.
  • Orders placed for installation in Spain, Ontario, S. Korea, Australia, US Southwest.
  • Considering PV spinoff and IPO
• Spectrolab
  • Large number of orders (not public).
  • Multiple offers made on Spectrolab by variety of equity groups and at least one CPV company.
• Problems:
  • Both companies encumbered by space market/gov’t constraints and priorities (NASA/DOD).
  • Large order backlog, capacity can’t meet demand.
  • Poor customer service, lack of customization. Big disadvantage for CPV systems mfgs.
  • Vertically integrating, mfg’ing CPV systems
      • now competing head-to-head with many customers
  • Risky, unproven technology roadmap for achieving higher efficiencie

The Solar Junction
Technical Advantage

Current III‐V Three Junction
PV is Inherently Limited
• Three junctions (3J) target optimal efficiency for 88% of the solar spectrum with 45% theoretical efficiency (silicon is 30% theoretical efficiency)
• III‐V 3J efficiency has been limited because the smallest bandgap junction is not optimally efficient
• Solar Junction solves this by delivering an optimally efficient 1 eV junction through unique, innovative design and materials combined with superior technology and execution
• Solar Junction’s breakthrough employed a “clean sheet of paper approach” that would require competitors to re‐tool their process lines to compete (3‐year+ lead to SJ), or to engineer and implement a complex four‐junction device
