Our pitch in 3 steps
1. Renewable energy needs big storage – 	12,000 megawatts in California alone
2. Halotechnics has the solution – 	We store electricity as heat, partnering with Shell
3. We’re offering you a great deal to get involved – 	Raising $500k notes with $2.25M cap

Renewable energy needs electricity storage
12,000 MW of storage is needed in California alone
From Storage
12,000 MW
Electricity Demand (MW)
Demand minus solar and wind
Time of Day

Our competition cannot meet the need
Pumped hydro – can’t site it
Batteries – too expensive
Compressed air – can’t site it
Natural gas plants – CO2, NOx pollution
