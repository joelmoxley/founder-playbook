SBV Pilot Goals, Purpose, and Background 
www.sbv.org 


Small Business = Big Economic Impact 
SMALL BUSINESS FACTS
Driving the spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship and individual initiative.
23 million small businesses representing
99% of all employers
account for more than 1/2 of all private sector jobs
Source: Council on Small Businesses
DOE awarded ~$15M in Small Business Vouchers in FY16 and has made another $12M available in FY17.  
Eligible Small Businesses are US based and US owned for profit entities with fewer than 500 employees world wide. 
www.sbv.org 


Our mission is to significantly increase the industrial impact of DOE national labs on the U.S. clean energy sector. 
Demonstrate the value of lab-developed science and technology 
Increase and streamline access to national lab capabilities 
Increase and enhance lab-private sector partnerships 
www.sbv.org 


Small Business Challenges in Accessing Lab Capabilities: 
* Cannot afford it 
* Contracting process is too long and burdensome 
* Lab system is difficult to navigate (cannot locate right researcher) 

SBV One Stop Shop

The SBV Pilot Addresses Small Business Challenges by: 
* Making funding available for ~100 vouchers.  
* Streamlining back end business practices to shorten contracting process. 
* Implementing a support network to help small businesses navigate the entire lab system by technology area.

12 DOE national laboratories participating in SBV in 9 tech areas

TRL levels: All Requests – Round 1 vs. Round 2
80% of requestors – demonstrated feasibility of the technology in a lab
77% of requestors – prototype created/tested 
30% of requestors – achieved commercial sales
52% of requestors – pilot technology demonstration
81% of awardees – demonstrated feasibility of the technology in a lab
71% of awardees – prototype created/tested

53% of awardees – pilot technology demonstration
Round 1 Round 2


General Observations from Round 2
* The selection process was very competitive.
* Clear alignment with Technology Areas is critically important.
* In general, team qualifications and experience scored well. If in-kind contributions are planned as cost share, the team must have the expertise and resources to perform the planned work.
* In general, scores for problem definition and impact were somewhat lower than the team and resources scores.


Round 3 Schedule and Logistics

Careful Study of the Notice of Opportunity is Strongly Encouraged
Notice of Opportunity has critical info
* Specific technology areas and funding levels
* Merit review criteria and weighting
* Terms and conditions (standard agreements)
* Reporting requirements 
* Cost share
* Request for assistance template

Find the Notice of Opportunity here:
https://www.sbv.org/community-library/accounts/92/925112/Notice-of-Opportunity-SBV-Request-for-Assistance-RFA.pdf


Eligibility 
Small Businesses must be a employees worldwide, be U.S. for- -based and U.S. profit business-with fewer than 500 owned, AND…
* Unique Lab Capabilities: Request assistance that is not reasonably available in the private sector. Projects are intended to make available the specialized expertise and equipment at the national labs, not compete with the private sector.
* Cost Share: Commit to a 20% cost share which can be in-kind. Examples: labor, travel, materials, equipment, or data. Federally funded awards, such as SBIR/STTR, may not be used for small business cost share. More information on cost share is included in the Notice of Opportunity: Request for Assistance, section G.
* Agreements: Sign one of two short, non-negotiable agreements that govern intellectual property and other terms. The agreements are 1) SBV Technology Assistance Pilot Agreement (TAPA) or 2) Short Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (Short CRADA)
* Reporting: Commit to providing results during the project and for up to ~5 years after the project start date.
* Release of Information: Agree to allow non-proprietary information about your business and the success of the assistance to be featured in publicly available stories by DOE and the labs.


Standardized Agreements
Two Standard Non-Negotiable Agreements:
(1) SBV Cooperative Research & Development Agreement (CRADA)
(2) SBV Technology Assistance Pilot Agreement (TAPA)

Intellectual Property Language in both agreements is the same: The small business is granted a paid-up, royalty-free, nonexclusive license, without the right to sublicense, in a limited Field of Use.

Why standardized agreements? Both labs and small businesses have expressed desire to streamline the SBV agreement process by establishing pre-negotiated terms and conditions, especially on IP.

Why two agreements? To allow for as much flexibility in small business engagement as possible, the SBV Pilot will offer a choice between the TAPA (non-IP generating work) and the CRADA (IP generating work).



Reporting Requirements & Cost Share
Requests selected for Vouchers must agree to provide the following:

Report Data for 5 Years:
A third-party evaluator will request information from small business voucher recipients annually through 2020 (5 years).
