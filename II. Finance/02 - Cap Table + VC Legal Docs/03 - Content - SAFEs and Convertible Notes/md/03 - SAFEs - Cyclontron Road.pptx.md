Overview
1. Investors use various valuation methodologies, but the value of an early stage startup is  highly uncertain.
2. Convertible Notes are a common approach to address the uncertainty of startup value at time of investment.
3. The terms of the convertibles can result in drastically different outcomes. 
4. SAFEs are similar to convertibles notes but are relatively simpler and use equity instead of debt. 

.

1. Investors use various valuation methodologies

Comparables
1. Find more mature/exited companies that emulates the startups business model
2. Estimate the value of these comparable companies at the startup’s stage.

Discounted Cash Flow
1. Forecast future revenue of company (and terminal value)
2. Discount with an appropriate rate of return (as high as ~50%)

3. Conversion Discount
* Conversion Discount: early investors reward for taking early risk, 10% - 25% - more commonly 20%
* Example 1
  * Startup raises $100K in convertible note with 25% discount
  * 1 year later, Series A at $1m valuation and 20% of shares 
  * Seed investor will receive $100k worth of shares + 25%*$100k = $125k worth of shares or 12.5% of shares
  * Founders own 100% - 20% - 12% = 67.5%
* Example 2
  * Startup raises $100K in convertible note with 5% discount
  * 1 year later, Series A at $1m valuation and 20% of shares 
  * Seed investor will receive $100k worth of shares + 5%*$100k = $105k worth of shares or 10.5% of shares
  * Founders own 100% - 20% - 12% = 69.5%


3. Cap
* Cap: Seed stage investors can impose an upper limit of the valuation at which their shares convert  
* Example 1
  * Startup raises $100k in convertible note with $1m cap
  * 1 year later, Series A at $10m valuation and 20% of shares 
  * Seed investor will receive $100k/$1m (the cap) = 10%
  * Founders own 100% - 20% - 10% = 70%
* Example 2
  * Startup raises $100K in convertible note with no cap
  * 1 year later, Series A at $10m valuation and 20% of shares 
  * Seed investor will receive $100k/$10m (the valuation) = 1%
  * Founders own 100% - 20% - 10% = 79%


3. Interest Rate and Maturity (the Debt side)
* Interest Rate: a convertible note is ultimately a loan with an accrued interest reflecting the time value of money and the lender’s risk
  * 1% - 10%, currently at the lower end
* Investors do not target making their returns using interest rate, and it is a relatively secondary consideration

* Maturity Date: The date by which the loan converts or is repaid 
  * Usually set around the time expectation for a Series A
  * The entrepreneurs best interest is to defer this date and reduce pressure to raise A if not necessary
  
  
4. SAFEs have similar features to convertible notes, without the debt part
* SAFEs convert to shares once a valuation (through a series A) is established
* SAFEs offer the investor and founder the same flexibility of convertible notes, but removes the downside protection for the investor
  * E.g. if a startup raises $100k in convertible notes and at maturity, cannot repay, they go bankrupt
  * However, if the startup raises $100k in a SAFE, shares convert to equity instead of triggering a bankruptcy 
  * The SAFEs will convert to investor shares in a way that punishes the entrepreneurs 
  * Realistically, if the startup has failed, shares are worthless
