hi this is Nikki from venture hacks. 
I'm going to show you how to use this cap table that we put together.
Go to the second worksheet which contains the common stock and the pre-money options, fill in the blue numbers and everything else is taken care of. 
so fill in the stock for the founders and then fill in the pre-money options for the existing employees. the total common stock and pre-money options in the company is 4.6 million shares. again fill in the blue figures and everything else is taken care of. 
let's go back to the first worksheet which contains the cap table. fill in the pre-money in this case the company is a premium only of six million dollars. fill in the amount of cash you're raising, in this case two investors are splitting four million dollars between the two of them, each one is investing two million dollars and fill in any debt you raised prior to the series a. if you didn't raise any debt just set these figures to zero.
in this case, we raise 50k of debt from two investors before the series a and split it evenly between the two of them giving them each 25k. fill in the desired size of the post money option pool, these are the new options that you're going to create for new employees and set the discount of the debt if there is any. 
now that you've filled in all the blue numbers the spreadsheet does the rest of the work. 
first of all the post money value is ten million dollars that consists of a six million dollar pre-money and four million dollars that was invested by the series a investors. then it calculates the share price which is about 96 cents, there's a tricky calculation but you can see it at the bottom of the spreadsheet in the notes, it shows the amount of the investors owned. in this case, each of the investors owns 20% for a total of 40% the C debt investors each own 0.38 percent of the company, together they own 0.77 percent of the business.
and the common stock and pre-money options that we saw in that second worksheet together own forty four point two three percent of business. and as we set in the initial inputs we have a 15% post money option pool. 
you can see how many shares everybody has in this column.
there are a total of ten point four million shares in the business on a fully diluted basis and the company raised four point zero five million dollars in the series a, which includes the debt money.
and the effective pre-money is about four point four million dollars. the effective pre-money is the value of the existing common stock and pre money options in the business. it doesn't include the new 15% post money option pool or the seed debt or its discount. 
your six million dollar pre-money valuation unfortunately includes the seed debt and the new post money option pool. 
once you subtract out the seed debt and the post money option pool from the pre-money the value of your existing common stock and pre money options is about four point four million dollars, that's what we call the effective pre-money and of course your common stock and pre money options are all subject to vesting so what you actually own right now is even less than the effective pre money 
I'm going to scroll down to the summary. 
this summarizes the amount of stock that the founders the preferred shareholders and all of the option holders including the pre money options and the post money options had, and it summarizes them across time. so it shows you how much people had at the pre money and how much they had at the post money. 
so at the pre money, the founders had about 87 percent of the business and the pre money options had about 13 percent of the business for a total of one hundred percent.
after the financing, the founders had about thirty eight percent of the company, the preferred shareholders have about 41 percent of the company and the pre money options plus the post money options total about 21 percent of the company, post money fully diluted. 
and then we pretend the common stock share price is the same as the preferred share price and calculate the founders share value. 
we already know what the preferred share value is and then we calculate the share value of the pre-money and the post money options, in total they all add to ten million dollars. 
now I'm just going to scroll one column to the right and calculate the exit value of the company. there's one last thing you need to fill in it is what you think you can sell the company for. let's be optimistic and save fifty million dollars, we're just making up a number.
So if you sell the company for 50 million dollars, the founders will receive 19 point two million dollars, investors will receive twenty point three and the pre-money and post money option holders will receive ten point three million dollars.
finally let's go back to the second worksheet. we already filled in the shares column at the beginning of the screencast with the number of shares. each employee has the other columns are the post money, this is the percentage of the company that the founders have after
5:39the financing and each of the pre-money employees have after the financing. next is the share value column, you already saw this in the summary in the first worksheet, here we break it down per founder and per employee.
and finally we have the exit value column, assuming we sell the company for 50 million dollars, how much money does each founder get and how much money does each pre money option holder get.
bull here isn't to fantasize about how much money you make but rather to describe to the co-founders and your prospective employees how much money they might be making if things go well.
and there you have it a series a cap table god bless venture hex!
