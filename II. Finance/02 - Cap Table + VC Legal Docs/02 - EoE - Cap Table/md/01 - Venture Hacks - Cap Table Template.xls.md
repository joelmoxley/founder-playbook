Instructions!!!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Everything is calculated from the blue numbers in both worksheets. Fill them in.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Notes																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
We assume that all of the Debt and Post-Money Options come out of the Pre-Money.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
We assume that all of the Pre-Money Options have been allocated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Effective Pre-Money is the value of the Common Stock and Pre-Money Options, i.e. it does not include the Debt and Post-Money Options.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Debt calculations do not include interest payments.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Exit Value assumes there is no liquidation preference and no additional dilution before an exit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Share Value assumes that the Common Stock's fair market value is equal to the Share Price;																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
in reality, the Common Stock's fair market value is much lower than the Share Price.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Calculations																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
For your information, after you fill in the blue numbers, the main variables are calculated with the following equations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
These are useful if you want to customize the spreadsheet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Post-Money = Pre-Money + Total Series A																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Share Price = (Pre-Money - Post Money x Post-Money Pool - Total Seed Debt / (1 - Debt Discount)) / Common Stock and Pre-Money Options																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Effective Pre-Money = Share Price x Common Stock and Pre-Money Options																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Post-Money Options = Post Money x Post-Money Pool / Share Price																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Investor Shares = Investment / Share Price																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
Lender Shares = Investment / (Share Price x (1 - Debt Discount))
