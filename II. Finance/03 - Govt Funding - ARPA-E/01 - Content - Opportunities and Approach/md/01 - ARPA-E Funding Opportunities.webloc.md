Apply
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) provides a continuing opportunity for the rapid support of early-stage applied research to explore innovative new concepts with the potential for transformational and disruptive changes in energy technology. IDEAS awards are intended to be flexible and may take the form of analyses or exploratory research that provides the agency with information useful for the subsequent development of focused technology programs. IDEAS awards may also support proof-of-concept research to develop a unique technology concept, either in an area not currently supported by the agency or as a potential enhancement to an ongoing focused technology program. Applications must propose concepts that are not covered by open ARPA-E focused FOAs and that also do not represent incremental improvements over existing technology.

IDEAS awards are defined as single-phase efforts of durations 12 months or less with a total project cost of $500,000 or less and will be issued through Grants.

This FOA is a continuation of the IDEAS Program initially announced in September 2013 and continued for a second year in September 2014. ARPA-E continues to view the IDEAS program as a success and therefore plans to extend this FOA on an annual basis, based on the availability of funds.

DE-FOA-0001691: POWER NITRIDE DOPING INNOVATION OFFERS DEVICES ENABLING SWITCHES (PNDIODES)
The PNDIODES (Power Nitride Doping Innovation Offers Devices Enabling SWITCHES) program seeks to fund transformational advances and mechanistic understanding in the process of selective area doping in the III-Nitride wide band gap (WBG) semiconductor material system and the demonstration of arbitrarily placed, reliable, contactable, and generally useable p-n junction regions that enable high-performance and reliable vertical power electronic semiconductor devices. The microscopic mechanistic understanding and transformational technologies will address the major obstacle in the fabrication of vertical GaN power electronic devices experienced by most of the teams in the ARPA-E SWITCHES (Strategies for Wide Bandgap, Inexpensive Transistors for Controlling High-Efficiency Systems) program. This challenge has been the lack of a viable GaN selective area doping or selective area epitaxial regrowth process that yields material of sufficiently high quality to enable a defect-free p-n junction on patterned GaN surfaces. Success in this area will allow further development of a revolutionary and powerful class of vertical GaN power electronic devices suitable for 1200V to 10kV broad range of applications (consumer electronics, power supplies, solar inverters, wind power, automotive, motor drives, ship propulsion, rail, and the grid).

DE-FOA-0001714: FACSIMILE APPEARANCE TO CREATE ENERGY SAVINGS (FACES)
The objective of the FACES Program is to develop advanced information technologies which will dramatically reduce the need to travel for the purpose of communication, thereby reducing travel-related energy consumption and its associated greenhouse gas emissions, as well as increasing the efficiency of energy use and improving economic security. 

Telecommunication technology has advanced significantly since the invention of the telegraph, yet we are still far from this ideal. Today’s telecommunication technologies still lack essential characteristics demanded by human interaction. ARPA-E believes that extraordinary technological shifts over the past two decades have created an opportunity to dramatically improve the utility of telecommunication technology.


This digital form of transportation has the potential to reduce communication-related travel energy consumption by several orders of magnitude because information networks consume substantially less energy than all traditional forms of transportation (such as planes, trains, and automobiles). Travel for the purpose of in-person communication is responsible for roughly 8% of the United States’ energy consumption, so the ultimate success of this Program could yield a reduction in energy consumption of several quadrillion BTUs per year in the US alone. 

Of essential importance is that an individual would prefer to use the “digital transportation” Technologies developed under the FACES Program rather than the energy-, time-, and cost-intensive status quo of physical travel, thereby providing a substantial incentive for market adoption. If the FACES Program is successful, the United States will benefit from the positive externalities of decreased dependence on petroleum and therefore increased energy security, decreased energy-related emissions, and increased efficiency of communication-related energy expenditure.

To achieve these goals, the FACES Technologies must provide an experience that meets or exceeds the current benefits of in-person interactions. ARPA-E believes that technical advances in computer technology, sensors, displays, computer graphics, and information networks, all of which have changed the world in their own right, will allow this high-quality communication across any distance. 

The FACES Program will focus on communication systems employing “Digital Humans”. A Digital Human (DH) is a bandwidth-efficient, three-dimensional digital representation of a person that is nearly indistinguishable from the communication partner in real life.


These DH communication systems must provide highly natural and immersive communication that is preferable to physically travelling, and have the potential to be very low cost in their implementation so that the average person can afford to communicate in this way. ARPA-E has identified three critical elements to developing DH communication systems as means of decreasing energy consumption (note: the following is a summary - the Technical Categories of Interest in Subsection E, and Performance Targets in Subsection F, below are controlling for application submissions): 

1. ARPA-E seeks advances in real-time motion capture and digitization of the full human form, coupled with the real-time reconstruction and display of the resultant full human likeness at the other end of an information network, yielding an audiovisually-realistic DH-based digital transportation platform. 

2. ARPA-E seeks innovative, complementary advances in the requisite Technology components of real-time capture, digitization, reconstruction, and other related hardware and software tools deemed necessary for or conducive to digital transportation. 

3. ARPA-E seeks innovative studies of travel-replacement thresholds, new metrics for realism and immersion of telecommunications systems, and for systematic evaluation of DH technologies.

FACES Technologies will be subject to rigorous and quantitative evaluation metrics, and must demonstrate progress towards meeting travel-replacement thresholds. The development and use of the travel-replacement thresholds for digital transportation will be an important contribution of this Program.

DE-FOA-0001726: MACROALGAE RESEARCH INSPIRING NOVEL ENERGY RESOURCES (MARINER)
The United States has the world’s largest marine Exclusive Economic Zone, an area of ocean along the nation’s coast lines which is equivalent to the total land area of all 50 states. The nation has the potential to utilize this resource to build and grow a thriving marine biomass industry for the production of fuels, chemicals, feed, and food. Growing macroalgal biomass in the oceans offers a unique opportunity to sidestep many of the challenges associated with terrestrial biomass production systems, particularly the growing competition for land and freshwater resources, which are likely to result from the 50 to 100% increase in demand for food expected for 2050. The overall goal of this program is to develop the critical tools that will allow the nascent macroalgae industry in the United States to leverage this tremendous resource and grow into a world leader in the production of marine biomass. The program will focus on developing advanced cultivation technologies that enable the cost and energy efficient production of macroalgal biomass in the ocean at a scale suitable as feedstock for the production of fuels and chemicals. The challenge is to dramatically reduce capital and operating cost of macroalgae cultivation, while significantly increasing the range of deployment by expanding into more exposed, off-shore environments. Specifically, this program is interested in new designs and approaches to macroalgae cultivation, with harvesting and transport being an integral part of such systems. These new systems may leverage new material and engineering solutions, and autonomous and robotic operations, as well as advanced sensing and monitoring capabilities. To further accelerate the development and deployment of such systems, the program will also focus on the development of computational modeling tools and ocean- deployable sensor platforms, as well as advanced macroalgal breeding tools. ARPA-E expects that the MARINER program will support development of technologies that will accelerate the deployment of advanced ocean farming systems capable of delivering renewable biomass feedstock at a cost competitive with terrestrial biomass feedstocks.

DE-FOA-0001727: CREATING INNOVATIVE AND RELIABLE CIRCUITS USING INVENTIVE TOPOLOGIES AND SEMICONDUCTORS (CIRCUITS)
Development of advanced power electronics with unprecedented functionality, efficiency, reliability, and form factor will help provide the U.S. a critical technological advantage in an increasingly electrified world economy. The CIRCUITS (Creating Innovative and Reliable Circuits Using Inventive Topologies and Semiconductors) program seeks to accelerate the development and deployment of a new class of efficient, lightweight, and reliable power converters based on wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors through transformational system-level advances that enable effective operation at high switching frequency, high temperature, and low loss. Previous efforts by ARPA-E and others have primarily focused on WBG material and device development without focused consideration and redesign of the circuit topology. Such solutions do not fully exploit the potential performance improvements enabled by this new class of power semiconductor devices. Areas of particular interest for the CIRCUITS program include novel circuit topologies, advanced control and drive electronics, and innovative packaging. Such technological breakthroughs would catalyze the adoption of higher performance power converters in various critical applications (motor drives, automotive, power supplies, data centers, aerospace, ship propulsion, rail, distributed energy, and the grid) that offer significant direct and indirect energy savings and emissions reductions across electricity generation, transmission and distribution, and load-side consumption. Coupling novel and advanced circuit topologies with leading edge materials such as WBG semiconductor devices has the capacity to catalyze disruptive improvements for power electronics and subsequently for the U.S. economy.

DE-FOA-0001737: SAVING ENERGY NATIONWIDE IN STRUCTURES WITH OCCUPANCY RECOGNITION (SENSOR)
This program aims to dramatically reduce the amount of energy used for heating and cooling residential buildings (by 30%) via user-transparent sensor systems that accurately sense human presence (not merely motion). This program also aims to reduce energy usage in commercial buildings (also by 30%) by enabling ventilation control based on sensor systems that can accurately count the number of humans in a pre-determined zone. If these sensing technologies can be widely deployed with disruptively low price targets and failure rates, a significantly lower usage of energy will result without impact to comfort of the occupants of the space. Heating, cooling, and ventilation (HVAC) reduction is only one way energy can be saved; such human presence sensing and people counting will enable drastic improvements in the way buildings communicate with and respond to their occupants.

The accuracy, reliability, and cost requirements to deliver such substantial energy savings are far beyond the limits of sensor systems available today. However, ARPA-E believes that by building on recent trends in improved performance and reduced cost in low-power consumer electronics and wireless communication technologies, it is possible to achieve the required performance levels through a focused push in the SENSOR program. Supporting systems currently exist (i.e., thermostats/controls, variable air volume systems, etc.) that could utilize data from such sensor systems to achieve the program’s energy reduction targets today, with only slight modifications. In order to ensure impact for the new sensor systems, significant adoption barriers must be identified and clearly understood, technical paths to overcome these barriers must be defined, and real-world performance of these technical solutions validated.

RFI-0000028: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TEAMING PARTNER LIST FOR AN UPCOMING FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT: DIGITAL TRANSPORTATION
The Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy (ARPA-E) intends to issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), tentatively entitled: Digital Transportation. The final FOA is expected to be issued in November 2016. When the FOA is issued, ARPA-E anticipates that the deadline for submission of Concept will occur 30 days after issuance. The overall goal of the Digital Transportation program will be to develop communication technologies that are preferable to physical travel, consistent with ARPA-E’s statutory goals including development of energy technologies that improve energy efficiency, reduce energy-related emissions, and reduce energy imports from foreign sources. To achieve the Digital Transportation program goals, technologies are needed that enable the real-time capture and digitization of extremely detailed communicative information, which, after having been transmitted over a digital information network, can then be reconstructed and displayed in a highly natural and immersive way to a remote observer. As described in more detail below, the purpose of this announcement is to facilitate the formation of new project teams to respond to the upcoming FOA. The forthcoming Digital Transportation FOA will provide specific program goals, technical metrics, selection criteria, and other terms and requirements. For purposes of this Teaming Partner List, the following summarizes current planning for the FOA:

The technical goals of the anticipated FOA will primarily focus on real-time capture and digitization of extremely detailed communicative information, which can then be reconstructed and displayed in a highly natural and immersive way to a remote observer. All communicative information must be captured, including, but not limited to, shared gaze, facial expressions and microexpressions, all body language, and spatialized audio. This digital reconstruction must be able to be ported across many display modalities, have lighting conditions and viewing angles changed in real time, and enable the comfortable meeting of many individuals at the same time in a split screen or digital environment. The motion capture must be done conveniently, at low cost, and must have the potential to be display-integrated. The digitization and encoding must be done in real time to foster simultaneous live communication, with capture-to-display latencies below 150 ms (including network latencies across the United States). The encoded information is expected to be highly bandwidth efficient, allowing beyond-human-perception levels of resolution and refresh-rate on the display side, both aurally and visually, for less than 1 Mbps of transmitted information per conversation member. The anticipated FOA will also enable the development of complementary technologies that the community justifies as being necessary for the realization of digital transportation. Finally, the anticipated FOA will include a call for studies that aim to definitively and quantitatively establish the set of requirements for digital transportation technologies to be preferable to physical travel, and methods to test and validate progress of these technologies towards travel-reduction. It is envisioned that accomplishing these objectives will allow users to leverage information networks for their communication-based travel needs instead of physically travelling, saving at least one order of magnitude of energy in the process, and potentially saving the United States several percent of the nation’s yearly energy consumption.

ARPA-E anticipates that the FOA will target research in: (1) real-time capture, digitization, and reconstruction of extremely detailed communicative information, of a fidelity commensurate with travel-replacement, with cross-platform display compatibility; (2) complementary technologies proposed as necessary for travel reduction, including but not limited to server-side communication environments, novel display modalities, and stationary capture and digitization tools; and (3) third party testing and validation of digital transportation technologies which will yield clear and quantitative results regarding system performance necessary to replace physical travel and save energy.

In order to realize the goals of the Digital Transportation program, ARPA‐E aims to bring together diverse engineering and scientific communities including, but not limited to, computer-generated imagery and image processing, modular software architectures, machine perception and motion capture technologies, visual display technologies, human movement physiology, real-time communication server-side management, parallel processing and GPU-based visual rendering, user interface and user experience, telecommunication companies, internet companies, scholarly validation of travel-replacement criteria, and business management and other related researchers that can develop and test the new digital transportation technologies such that they are successful in the marketplace in ultimately replacing travel and saving energy.

As a general matter, ARPA-E strongly encourages outstanding scientists and engineers from different organizations, scientific disciplines, and technology sectors to form project teams. Interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration spanning organizational boundaries enables and accelerates the achievement of scientific and technological outcomes that were previously viewed as extremely difficult, if not impossible.

The Teaming Partner List is being compiled to facilitate the formation of new project teams. The Teaming Partner List will be available on ARPA-E eXCHANGE (http://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov), ARPA-E’s online application portal, starting in November 2016.

RFI-0000030: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TEAMING PARTNER LIST FOR AN UPCOMING FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT: SAVING ENERGY NATIONWIDE IN STRUCTURES WITH OCCUPANCY RECOGNITION (SENSOR)
The Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy (ARPA-E) intends to issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) tentatively entitled Saving Energy Nationwide in Structures with Occupancy Recognition (SENSOR) to fund the development of novel occupancy and people counting sensors. Such hardware can lead to significant energy savings for heating and cooling in both residential and commercial scenarios, with additional energy savings possible via enabling demand controlled ventilation in the commercial scenarios. In addition, methods and facilities to accurately validate the sensor performance and resulting energy savings in quasi- and real- world scenarios is included.

As described in more detail below, the purpose of this announcement is to facilitate the formation of new project teams to respond to the upcoming SENSOR FOA. The anticipated FOA will provide specific program goals, technical metrics, selection criteria, and other terms and requirements. The anticipated FOA terms will be controlling. ARPA-E anticipates that the deadline for submission of Concept Papers will occur 30 days after issuance of the anticipated FOA. For purposes of the Teaming Partner List, the following summarizes current planning for the anticipated FOA:

The technical goals of the anticipated FOA will be centered on the development of novel sensor systems that can be validated to return occupancy and people counting data with certainty (i.e. high-accuracy and low-failure rates) at cost suitable for market adoption. “Sensor” as used here means the actual hardware sensor component(s), any on-board algorithms or hardware needed to turn the sensing signals into an accurate binary (for residential) or occupant count (for commercial, as described below); an industry accepted open-source method for communicating that information outside of the sensor system including encryption (wi-fi, BLE, or the like); a power source; and any additional nodes (in the case of a wireless sensor networks) needed to compile and transmit the information to building controls, such as a thermostat or a building automation system (BAS).

Two use cases have been identified. For the residential case, a whole home binary occupation signal is required, with this requirement the system must distinguish between humans and their pets. This occupancy signal will be used to change the temperature setbacks to “away” mode, and then automatically back to “occupied” mode when the home is again occupied. The user will not need to ever interact with the thermostat’s scheduling function as the occupancy controlled auto-scheduling will be “correct” almost all of the time, in accordance with the technical program metrics. In the commercial case where buildings are ventilated, there is an additional opportunity; energy used for ventilation is as least as significant as that used for heating and cooling, and the required ventilation level for a commercial space can be vary depending on how many people are occupying a specific HVAC (“heating, cooling, and ventilation”) zone, according to building standards. If the number of people are known for each zone, the ventilation can be tailored to be adequate without massively over-ventilating the space. In order to enhance user adoption, the development of similarly low cost, stable, and easy-to-deploy CO2 sensors is in scope of this work to address concerns regarding indoor air quality (IAQ), even if they cannot be used to accurately measure occupancy directly.

In order to realize the goals of the SENSOR program, ARPA‐E aims to bring together diverse engineering and scientific communities, including but not limited to sensor materials development, sensor device development, ultra-low power electronics platforms, distributed sensing systems, distributed wireless networks, advanced algorithm development, automated buildings, smart buildings, energy efficient buildings, indoor air quality (“IAQ”), HVAC control systems, and others. This includes input from the end-users of such technologies in the HVAC space, such as HVAC system fabricators, building managers, energy utilities, and the like. In addition, communities regarding the real-world testing and validation of such sensors, including validating the energy saved, are sought.

As a general matter, ARPA-E strongly encourages outstanding scientists and engineers from different organizations, scientific disciplines, and technology sectors to form new project teams. Interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration spanning organizational boundaries enables and accelerates the achievement of scientific and technological outcomes that were previously viewed as extremely difficult, if not impossible.

RFI-0000031: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TEAMING PARTNER LIST FOR AN UPCOMING FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT: DESIGNS FOR ADVANCED MODULAR NUCLEAR REACTORS
The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA–E) intends to issue a new Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to support R&D on advanced nuclear reactor technologies that enable safe, secure, and flexible energy production by nuclear fission with dramatically lower capital and operating costs. These technologies are expected to be deployed for electricity production and/or uses such as production of industrial process heat or desalination.

Nuclear power plants currently provide nearly 20% of the total U.S. electricity generation with 99 operating nuclear reactors for a total installed capacity of 98.7 GW. These nuclear plants are all conventional, light-water cooled reactors (LWRs), which have been the workhorse of the nuclear industry for several decades now. However, nuclear power in the U.S. is facing significant challenges of high operational and maintenance costs, the impending retirement of power plants as reactors near the end of their operational lifetimes, and very slow, expensive construction of new LWR power plants to replace retirements or supplement the existing fleet.

The U.S. and many other countries around the world have explored new reactor types beyond LWR technology, including different coolants, moderators, fuels, and reactor core designs. These advanced reactor concepts are commonly called “Gen IV” nuclear reactors. While there is great promise for advanced Gen IV designs, there remain a large number of technical challenges – ranging from understanding of fundamental issues in materials to systems-level engineering for safe, practical, and economical construction and operation – before they are ready for deployment.

ARPA-E is planning a new R&D program seeking innovative designs of advanced nuclear power plants and computational validations of these designs that can achieve safe, secure, and economical power production. The envisioned program seeks transformative designs and manufacturing technologies to achieve semi-autonomous “walk-away safe” and secure operation; extremely low construction capital costs; and dramatically faster construction and commissioning times based on technologies such as modular assemblies and factory manufacturing. The program seeks cross-disciplinary teams of innovators from the nuclear community and other scientific and engineering disciplines to instill new, creative approaches in solving fundamental challenges in nuclear power plant design, construction, and operation. Success in this program will establish a set of high-fidelity designs of new advanced nuclear reactors and set a path for the U.S. to lead the world in “Gen IV and beyond” nuclear power technologies.

In order to realize the goals of this program, expertise in the following areas may be useful:

Factory manufacturing of safety-grade and/or large components
Load following and grid integration
Generation of co-products such as industrial process heat, desalination, or hydrogen
Advanced construction techniques 
Reactor physics, neutronics, and shielding
Structural and functional materials Chemistry, chemical interactions, corrosion, and coolant chemistry control
Nuclear fuel design, fabrication, and performance
Power conversion, heat transport
Sensors, instrumentation, controls, autonomous operation, robotics
Diagnostics and prognostics
Safety, severe accidents, environmental impacts
Techno-economic analysis
Nuclear security and safeguards
Used fuel and waste management
Advanced/emerging technologies (such as advanced manufacturing)
Major experimental activities will not be funded under this program. However, it is the intent of ARPA-E to identify key experiments that need to be performed to validate the innovative designs in order to retire the key technical risks associated with the nuclear power plant designs. The proposal teams are encouraged to leverage other DOE Office of Nuclear Energy programs such as the GAIN (Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear) initiative (https://gain.inl.gov) to perform such experiments either during or after completion of the program.

As a general matter, ARPA-E strongly encourages outstanding scientists and engineers from different organizations, scientific disciplines, and technology sectors to form new project teams. Interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration spanning organizational boundaries enables and accelerates the achievement of scientific and technological outcomes that were previously viewed as extremely difficult, if not impossible.

RFI-0000032: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TEAMING PARTNER LIST FOR AN UPCOMING FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT: HYBRID SYSTEMS FOR ULTRA-HIGH EFFICIENCY CONVERSION OF NATURAL GAS TO ELECTRICITY
The Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy (ARPA-E) intends to issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for the development of hybrid fuel cell and engine systems for the ultra-high efficiency conversion of natural gas to electricity. The objective of this FOA will be to encourage the development of commercial-scale (>100 kW) Distributed Generation (DG) systems that have fuel to electric power conversion efficiencies in excess of 70% on a Lower Heating Value (LHV) basis. ARPA-E anticipates that the deadline for submission of Concept Papers to this FOA will occur 30 days after its issuance.

The long-term goal of the program will be to reduce the cost and increase the primary energy efficiency associated with the provision of electric power to commercial and industrial customers. The achievement of the aggressive efficiency (>70%) and installed cost (<$1800/kW) goals required to enable a targeted >1 Quad/year of fuel energy savings will require the development of new component technologies and systems approaches for the integration of fuel cells with heat or reactive engines.

As described in more detail below, the purpose of this announcement is to facilitate the formation of new project teams to respond to the upcoming FOA. The FOA will provide specific program goals, technical metrics, selection criteria, and other terms and requirements. However, for purposes of the Teaming Partner List, a summary of the currently anticipated scope is provided below.

The primary focus of the FOA will be the development of enabling component and sub-system technologies pertinent to the fuel cell or the engine or both of the sub-systems. Such technologies may include (but are not limited to) novel fuel cell stack designs, cost-effective and high efficiency engine/turbine component designs, highly integrated balance of plant designs, and demonstrations of system controls. If the development of these technologies proceeds at the desired rate, ARPA-E may also continue support through full-scale (≥ 100 kW) hybrid system development.

In order to realize the program goals, ARPA‐E aims to bring together diverse engineering and scientific communities, including researchers in the fields of electrochemistry, mechanical/thermal systems design and modeling, and systems integration and controls so that they can model, design, develop, and demonstrate the required component and system performances and engage the stakeholders required to introduce the new hybrid systems technologies into the marketplace.

As a general matter, ARPA-E strongly encourages outstanding scientists and engineers from different organizations, scientific disciplines, and technology sectors to form project teams. Interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration spanning organizational boundaries enables and accelerates the achievement of scientific and technological outcomes that were previously viewed as extremely difficult, if not impossible.
