Funding applications often require something shorter than a research paper, but more substantive than a business pitchâ€”you need a technical pitch. ARPA-E Program Directors Dane Boysen and Ilan Gur share their five best practices and five deadly sins for writing technical proposals. Participants will also learn about ARPA-E's mission and unique role in funding energy innovation. While the webinar uses concepts from the ARPA-E funding selection process, the proposal strategies are applicable to anyone attempting to communicate complex technical information in a short format.

welcome to today's edition of arpa-e University winning technical pitches with Dane boyston in de la mujer this is a fourth and intended series of practical seminars on core concepts and skills to help transition breakthrough technologies into successful commercial products RPG university was first launched at the 2012 RPE Energy Innovation Summit and we are pleased to announce that registration is now available for the 2013 RPE summit and more information can be found at ww RPE summit com you have ideas for topics for speakers that you'd like to see featured in future editions of RPG University please contact us to suggest those and we look to craft this series in a way that helps our community by providing research best practices and and lectures so we look forward to your suggestions today's presentation is a 30 minute overview followed by a discussion of QA since this is a rerecording we will be using QA that was submitted during our live presentation on october third and we'll be selecting questions for the discussion with dr. gore and dr. boysen today and I'll now introduce dr. Dane boysen who currently serves as an rfe program director his main focuses include electrochemical energy conversion and storage natural gas conversion and storage technology and materials for energy storage and conversion prior to joining our for a dr. boysen led the development of a grid scale energy storage liquid metal battery at MIT under professional Donald Sadoway and dr. languor also program director here at our PE is technical focus areas include electrical and thermal energy storage an advanced battery management solar energy and new materials for energy conversion and storage it also serves as the senior technical advisor helping our pease technology to market effort which focuses on preparing breakthrough energy technologies for the transition from lab to market including programs like today's RB university dr. gore has spent his career developing and commercializing clean energy technologies based on advances and material science prior to RP he served as co-founder and director of co a venture-backed Libyan bad up startup company dr. gore thanks so much Adam and thanks everyone who is joining us today you know just a quick sort of overview in terms of how this program came about you know the Adams just provided some nice introductions to dana myself you know the only and probably most important thing you need to know is that you know we're two of the folks here who end up reading all the proposals that come in and making decisions on what we're going to fund and basically you know we spend a lot of time as a team here at our PE you know together talking about our process talking about things that are going well and not well and and after reviewing a bunch of proposals you know this was the product of us sitting around you know and some of us saying you know what I really hate when when i'm looking at proposals you know this is really bother bother me this could have potentially been a great great proposal but the proposal came in this XY and z form and and that really you have stalked and then you know gained might respond and say oh but you know what i really love to see and we sort of have this conversation and then we said to ourselves well why should we keep this to ourselves you know if we share this community hopefully that lets everyone do a better job of submitting things that are in line with what we're looking for so that that's kind of the motivation is to help you all in the process there's a slide up here just just to emphasize what you're going to hear today is basically the views of dane and myself we think they're pretty representative of you know what's the set of program directors here at RBE kind of the way we think the way we perceive proposals what we're looking for but definitely definitely the one thing to keep in mind is you know if we have a solicitation out read the solicitation the solicitation describes in detail exactly what to say what criteria we're going to use to choose projects etc and so this should just be considered more of a broad general set of set of thoughts and guidance so you know one of the key points I think we'll make today is ya in the question of what's a winning pitch really depends on who is receiving the pitch and you know generally speaking honing a message to an audience is important so we figured Before we jump into our thoughts on on goods and bads in proposals rpe we should just give you a quick background on RB e which i think is relevant as many folks know arbys a very new agency we sit within the Department of Energy and the very short history of RB if we rewind back most folks know that RB is modeled after DARPA DARPA was created during the Sputnik days when folks you know basically you know we're watching satellite go through the sky and said you know hey that's not our technology maybe we're falling behind in some critical technologies for defense fast forward to 2016 above the Gathering Storm report from the National Academies there was another sense that you know here we are if we look at energy technologies this is a really critical wave of innovation that's that's coming globally it has implications to our environmental security our Economic Security our national security and we may be falling behind and so r peu is basically established to be a DARPA like agency for energy probably the most important thing for you folks on this slide is you know since our first funding in 2009 we've basically been operating at a run rate of about two hundred million dollars a year on average and we're at the heart on R&D funding agency so that boast of that money is going out to researchers through open competitive solicitations this is probably the most important slide on the background if there's anything to keep in mind about our PE it's that we have a very very clear mission from Congress it's spelled out in our statute our goal is to develop not the incremental technologies so not things that already exist on today's technology roadmaps but really over the horizon high impact disruptive we like use the words game-changing technologies but specifically with three goals one is to reduce the USS dependence on foreign energy sources one is to improve energy efficiency in the US and the third is to reduce emissions related to energy use and so these three goals really serve as a hard filter for us when we're looking at things we may want to fund if it doesn't fit at least one of these mission areas we generally will not touch it when we build programs that arpa-E there are a number of elements that we're looking for and I think this is reflected in the way we review proposals as well the first thing that we care about and one of the most important things is the question of impact and we basically asked ourselves in a program if the set of technologies we can fund in this program succeed will they make not a small impact but a significant impact and specifically a significant impact on one of our mission areas and so that's a really key piece I'd say similarly important is the second point here which is the question of is this a transformative technology and basically there we're really looking for new ideas we're looking for different approaches we're looking for things which you know i like to say have some innovative spark in them and so that we think this is something that has the opportunity to disrupt the way things are done today thirdly we're looking for things that create bridges bridges between science and technology I think one of the important bridges is you know creating bridges to to provide research to the areas which were you know in today are islands and not you know not finding support elsewhere in terms of rd support and so that's an important one and then finally you know i think this is true everyone's looking for a great team in our case we're looking for teams that possess all of the different qualities that you need to address the major technical that that you're overcoming in your in your technical project so so these are the key areas we're looking for and I think you'll find us refer back to them over the course of the next half an hour as we go through this presentation so that's some background on our PE we decided you know we were going to basically tell you about five things that we hate to see in five things that we love to see we're going to start them on the on the bad side and then and then Dane will pick it up and and hopefully give some more uplifting comments you know so this is a little cheeky here but we basically say you know thou shall not submit a proposal that is these things and again you know these are the things where you know that that keep us up at night after we've been reviewingproposals that we say wow that really frustrated me about x y&z proposals so let me just jump into these so the first and this relates to that impact right criteria that we're looking for the first is a proposal that we just see is insignificant and a few things could go wrong here one is you can just basically that the proposal may not do a good enough job showing a connection between success and the project to what the impact would be on the mission areas so sometimes it's just the way it's written we don't see a strong connection but then there are two manifestations of this that tend to arise that I think are worth pointing out so I just threw a couple examples here right so here's an example of a proposal we might get which talks about a really novel exciting new membrane technology that's going to make better coffee filters and basically this technology is going to improve the efficiency of coffee filtration I 10x right and that's going to impact over 100 million you know citizens in the US who drink coffee every day and so you know right what we find here is this is actually you know this is a huge improvement at 10x improvement it is a big deal and potentially it could be a big deal to any given coffee maker right but while there's a big improvement here there's not necessarily a big impact right and you know what we will do in almost every proposal is say well let's add up and see how it affects our mission area and in this case okay this is ten times more you know more efficient coffee makers so let's look at how many people in the  .s. own a coffee maker let's look at how often they're used let's look at that electricity savings will convert it back into primary energy savings and we generally want to see a significant impact which to us means you know we need to be on the order of quads right we need to be in percentages or multiple percentages of total u.s. primary energy consumption production emissions and here obviously we're not going to get to that to that scale so so this wouldn't pass the significant impact test a different type of example I have here is so this is an interesting one okay so now we've got a new hydrogels technology that allows you to create a super diaper which you use the diaper you flash it very quickly with UV light and all of a sudden you know it's kind of fully degradable it can dissolve in water in 30 seconds versus a typical dipole whichwould be you know many many years and in this case the impact is obviously really really big right this could save you know 18 billion diapers for an entering US landfills each year and so you know this is the type of proposal that comes into our PE where any individual program director might say you know i would loveto fund this this is a very high impact project and then we think about it and we say the unfortunate thing here is that it has a big impact but it's not a big impact on one of our mission areas right so our PE does not have the mission of saving you know municipal waste and and this isn't related to energy efficiency foreign energy sources emissions or at least not in a big enough way and so you know this is kind of a you know a fail in terms of trying to seek funding from our be so insignificant is the first one second is indistinguishable and basically you know this kind of goes to that novelty piece you might give us a proposal which actually has you know technically sound could have a very big impact but we may know that in your field of there are 30 other projects or 30 other teams around the country that are working on something very similar and so then the question is well what why should we be funding this specific proposal and if there are 30 other groups doing similar work directionally you haven't really told us enough of what you're doing different such that you couldn't you know why aren't you being funded by the same folks who are funding all the other folks around the world that are doing this work and so you really want to think about differentiation and say you know here's exactly what makes it different not just from the way things are being done today but also from other competing kind of emerging technology approaches around around the world so the third here is incremental and you know the picture here is is sort of you know just meant to be a metaphor right there are a lot of base hits that can be important but RP is an agency is not set up to fund based hits we're set up to fund projects which are looking for home runs and so oftentimes we will get proposals in that you know could potentially have a good impact could even be novel and creative but we basically say you know what the what they're actually asking us to fund we feel pretty confident that they'll be able to do it and you know if there's a high degree of confidence that the technical proposal the technical program will succeed there are probably that applies there are probably a number of sources of funding available for a low risk project right and so we want to put our p.e money into things where there aren't other sources of funding available largely because you know no one no one's willing to consider funding this proposal because it's sort of so out there so high risk so you know really sort of swinging for the fences and so it's something to keep in mind is if it seems like this is a low risk it seems like you're you're definitely going to succeed in the technical approach that that might not go over well when when we're looking at the proposal next one is incoherent we get a lot of proposals from top researchers and top practitioners around the country and that's great occasionally we run into this situation where we actually have a team with several you know all-stars superstars you know best in their field but then we start oh that's exciting and then we start reading the proposal and basically we see that it almost looks like these three or four individuals that are each amazing in their field each wrote a section of the proposal based on their knowledge base and then someone staples all together and submitted it if so the analogy here is you know if you look at this picture of the Jazz Band now these all might be world-class jazz players and yet if they're not coordinated and they don't have an align vision and they haven't practiced together I mean everyone looks kind of confused in this picture right the outcome could end up being pretty sloppy and we feel the same way about proposals if we don't feel like there's a cohesive vision around a project and a leader that's driving that vision among among a team that's working together that worries us quite a bit and that can be something that kind of kills a coastal proposal and then the fifth year is a particularly frustrating situation I put here you know it should not be indefinite which basically you know we oftentimes get proposals that have all of the right claims you know the very high impact seemed innovative etc and yet once we start reading we realized there's actually no detail on the technology being proposed and so I put an example here of sort of a good way and a bad way to do this and starting with the bad right so this is you know you'll recognize this picture from from Back to the Future this is the DeLorean time machine and you know we might get a proposal that says okay here's a next-generation vehicle allows for you know very energy efficient time travel ten times more efficient time travel to any date time place in the history of the Union universe wow that's huge a big impact and then you know they might say the technology leverage is novel proprietary technology from doc in the fly industries inc say okay interesting and it's been validated a proof of concept scale by these industry advisors who include several Nobel laureates and they're all fantastic right and and that's great but you haven't actually told us what we're talking about and we can't make a decision to fund something without any information and so sort of on the flip side here you know we would rather have this look like you know you'll notice the first bullet point here is the same major claim right which is great but then with it you know the proposal would say okay this is a next-generation flux capacitor based on x y&z alloy um you'll notice they don't have to give us any composition details they're just telling us you know something about the technology and you know here's some unhear some reason some rationale as to why the technology can give us the effect that we're claiming and ideally you have got some references there and then you know time travel requires 1.21 gigawatts of power and you know we've actually done a full mass and energy balance outlined in the table right so we want to see supporting evidence we want to see it through references we want to see it through data if you're worried about proprietary pneus if you're worried about giving up you know we don't want you folks to be giving up trade secrets etc you need to give some amount of detail in your proposal and so I'd say that's a bit of a cost of doing business but you'll notice in this case you know you can give a lot of supporting evidence without you know going into for instance the composition the specific composition you know you can provide data and you know sometimes you might leave out some of the pieces of the axes but call out specifically if you're leaving out information or you're not telling us something because you're worried about it being proprietary call that out so we understand why we're not getting full information and and we can find ways to deal with that but otherwise if you just don't tell us anything it's very hard for us to justify fun you know funding that that's a puzzle so you know this is just you know in review the five pieces of the deadly sins we describe the one thing I'd say is we occasionally get proposals where it seems pretty clear that the folks who are proposed we're proposing looked at all of the things that are pg wants to see in a proposal and basically sort of tailored the proposals to sound like you know they've really hit it out of the park on every access that we're looking for and so the one thing to keep in mind is you know this is generally these are the things we're looking for you know for instance if you think of impacted novelty oftentimes you know those two things are a bit at odds right we might have a very very poser that could be very high impact potentially but not so novel or less novel or a proposal that is a bit less high impact but the novelty is so interesting that we say you know we really need to fund this it's going to change the way people think about this entire field what we don't like to see his proposals that basically sort of try and work it so that everything looks incredible and so what I'd say is the sort of last deadly sin is you know be sincere don't be insincere in the proposal we'd rather have you tell us really what the strengths are and what the potential weaknesses are and and will respect that generally versus you know we will notice if a proposal just seems kind of part of the proposal really seems kind of out there and really sort of revved up to match what we're looking for it tends to not go over very well so that's that's my piece and I'm going to hand it over to deign to talk about some of the things we'd love to see in proposals and I think he's going to start by going through just a little bit of a description on on what the review process looks like at RBE to kind of help help guide that conversation thank you Elon I appreciate that Elon definitely hit home I think my sentiments on things that we don't like to see when we're reading proposals and hopefully now I can give you a little bit of background on things we like to see first I think it's probably useful to to go over what the process is our PE in terms of reviewing proposals to give you some perspective we we move very quickly the first thing to realize it the way RP works is that it's a what we call a program director driven agency both Elan and I come from other places where short term and in every program director at RP has a term limit of about three years which means that we have the very little time to start a program get it up review it and and then get it underway and the way it works is that once we started our PE we immediately begin doing a deep technical dies and trying to identify white space we hold a workshop or two to flush it out and then develop a program and then internally we pitch the program to the other program directors and the director of our PE and if its well-received then we will launch a follow up that entire process is somewhere between two and four months and once the BOA is released then typically we receive concepts or requests concept papers as a first stage a couple of pages a review of your your idea and then that those concept papers are reviewed by external reviewers typically it three external reviewers we are not a rack and stack for organization we don't we are not required to use what the reviewers or take the reviewers comments and select only those with high reviews we have the ability as program directors to use the reviewers inputs as as advice but can select programs or projects that did not score well in the review from the reviewers once we make sort of preliminary selections both at theconcept paper and the full paper phase we have to we have what we call it in America Review Board which is an internal process in which we go through every single program that we would like to select our every single project we would like to select for a program and then have to defend that in front of the other people on the review board so there there is a lot of internal checks and by the time we actually make our selections of whole proposals we usually know the project's pretty well because we actually have to descend project internally so if if you have gotten the project funded congratulations it means that a program director championed your project within our PE so that's I think important to realize when you're applying the RV is that that projects are picked up by the program directors so that's sort of the first first point now sort of just getting into what we like to see I this is just an example of an interesting paper that I took as a model it's not it's not illustrated of a technology that we particularly like to see but about more about how to write your sort of i would say particularly concept paper phase so as to have the best chance of being selected for full application and they're there you know there are a number of things that i think you can do that could really help you make that leap you should understand that in so in many cases we read hundreds of concept papers in the full or in the open for the first open flat there were four thousand almost four thousand applications which means that there were 12,000 reviews so it's it's a mind-numbing Lee large number of reviews to be done and at some point you know the program directors read through all those ones that they end up picking up so we read a lot of these things and so my this is as I said just a prototype example with a formula for you to help you pitch your technology to rbe so the first point first thing that we like seeing is described the technology innovation in the first sentence get to the point fast we read a lot of these things and we're all it RPE as program directors very technically capable we usually understand the problem pretty pretty well and what we like to see and we're really looking for is at least in the concept paper is the technology what's the technology what's new and innovative about your idea and that should be right up front so here in this case of the fluorine ion battery we put it right up at front we propose we propose we propose a rechargeable fluorine ion battery that uses solid-state fluorine ion conductor with metal fluorine electrodes so now I know right away what exactly the idea of the proposal is going to be around the second thing we like to see and it's incredibly useful in reviewing applications is is is visual aid so providing a visual aid that gives an idea of your technology directly after the first paragraph is extremely useful again we have to digest information very quickly because just the sheer volume of applications that we have so it doesn't have to be a super pretty picture it but it does need to be illustrative of what's happening in your technology oh it's a visual aids to help us digest the concept of what you're proposing so that's the second thing the third thing is in any new technology you should backup your your claims with some liminary data and if you don't have liminary data there should definitely be very strong scientific rationalization for why you think the technology should work so in this case we put some women ery charge-discharge cycles with a fluorine rechargeable fluorine ion batteries and so this we often get stuff with pretty pretty pretty big claims but there's but there's no nothing to back it up so claims are okay it's either you have data or you go through scientifically why what you're proposing is possible this is this is pretty critical so this is after we understand the idea this is the next thing we really look for is what is what is the justification for that idea okay or we generally do have a good idea where the state of the yard is however it is important to compare yourself to the state of the yard right up front in this case we set the example given the solid state fluorine ion batteries have a theoretical energy density of 792 watt-hours per kilogram which compares favorably to lithium ion batteries at 568 watt-hours per kilogram so here we've kind of shown right away that from a theoretical standpoint this battery is promising and this is basically what we're looking for we one might argue that your technology is so radical that there is nothing to compare it to for example you developed the first cell phone and there's only landlines in this case you should compare it to landlines this actually does help your proposal and demonstrating how radical it is so there always is some state of the art that can that there is that you should compare to to give us an idea of where the impact is okay last but not least after you've set up what the technical technological innovation is and you've said why it's you think it's possible or given some data the next question that's always on our mind is why hasn't someone done this before and so the next the last sort of thing we really like to see is a clear identification of what the technical challenges are why is this program risky that is and what's going to be your approach to solving them why why is it that you are going to be able to solve this problem and no one else has so we would get an example here you know several key challenges remain to demonstrating a viable chlorine ion battery including XYZ and then these are our approaches to solving those problems so this this is that the last thing in terms of if you've hit these sort of five high level items I think you all have gone a long ways to putting yourself forward as a winning winning proposal so just to start summarized in applying or preparing your technical pitch these are sort of the five things best practices one gets get to the point quickly what the technological innovation is to provide a visual aid that helps us and digesting what that innovation is three backup your data or give a strong rationale a strong rational and scientific rationalization why you think this is possible stay for say where you are relative to the state of the art and last identify the technical challenges so this is this advice is pretty focused on concept paper phase a lot of these elements translate to the full application phase I think it's important for you to take a look at what we call the hilum i er catechism when just after you complete your application going through this list of questions George hi Lamar was the DARPA director from nineteen seventy five to nineteen seventy-seven he helped develop digital displays I and he came  p with this list of questions for for  ARPA directors when they first started and every RPE director gets a copy of these questions when they start and these are the questions that we ask ourselves about our programs and we also ask these about every individual project so when you go through your application I would recommend that you take a look at these questions and ask if you've answered them very completely and they're pretty straightforward you know what is it you're trying to do and it articulated with no jargon how is it done today what's new about your approach often the most difficult one who cares why should we care about about what you're doing and if you're successful what's the impact that it will make how much will it cost how long is it going to take you know what you know we don't fund typically projects more than one time so at the end of us funding your project where will you be so what are the exams that let us know that you've been successful so these are really critical if you can go through these questions and and feel like you answered them completely within the context of the arpa-e mission I think you'll be on your way to having a winning application to RP and that's it I think we'll now move to questions great thank you very much staying any lawn and again today is a rerecording and we're using the questions that were submitted during our live broadcast and to start I wanted to go back to the issue of teens and ilan you talked about the kind of challenge if you've got superstars that don't seem that they have coordinated several of our questions asked you know what are the chances if you have a pure company as a very short history or maybe you're a less experienced investigator your ssistant professor you know how important is experienced in putting the team together and how you guys look at those projects uh so this is a lot I mean I think it's a I think it's a good question I'd start by saying you know generally speaking we talked about wanting to fund the best ideas sort of regardless of where they come from and so if you look at where r be projects get funded you know some are in academia some are in National Labs nonprofits traditional small businesses large company research groups and so you know we generally don't try not to have any biases really coming in to to what type of experience you need to have I think the two things that we look out really strongly one that I mentioned is if we line up all of the technical risks of a project to the team have the capabilities and expertise to address all of the different types of risks so if your project has a chemical a chemistry component and electrical electrical engineering component do you have a strong chemist in a strong electrical engineer you know in terms of experience I think you know we definitely need to see right summit we have some expertise in some capabilities I don't think you can answer that across the the bad experience obviously helps in demonstrating capabilities of expertise but I don't think it's you know having right someone on your team that has 50 years of experience and it is just sort of you know the Guru in the field and that's that's in no way a necessary component of a winning proposal and oftentimes some of the best new innovative ideas and some of the sort of hungriest most aggressive p is our younger folks with less experience I don't know Dean might have some other I I completely agree with Ilan I mean we get a lot of proposals to say or I've read a lot to say you know were the experts in this field funda hahaha so those don't hold a lot of water at RTE if you're an expert you better show it through the quality of your application not through saying that you're the expert that's that this holds no water here and I think I completely agree with you on some of the more innovative proposals come from the people that I would say a little on the less experienced side that doesn't mean that ultimately when you start to build out your team you shouldn't start to filled out some expertise that you're going to need to be successful but absolutely it's about the idea yeah I all just had one last thing I mean you know when we think about right we talked about the big things that are P is looking for you'll notice you know potential impact was huge novelty was huge right disruptive but we obviously care about will it succeed but it's actually rotor on the list you right into the question of you know trying to hit a home run is actually more important than you know do you have the 50 years of experience that will know you're going to accomplish it successfully right one might argue with all your 50 years experience you haven't done it yet there might be a disadvantage follow up on the teeming is some co Sebastian a desert but you prefers the industrial applicants rather than academic ones or are there specific requirements and combinations of ndustry and university you might want to comment on if there are preferences or FS agnostic i would say completely agnostic we you know a line I think hits the nail on the head we found ideas I don't care where they come from yeah I think one of one of the maybe misconceptions I think people sometimes people come to us and say well we know we need to be teaming you know with industry we know that we need to be teaming with other we need multidisciplinary projects to succeed at our PE and actually I think there might be correlation there but not causation in the sense that you know a lot of the teams we do fund have a multidisciplinary component have industry works of academia but oftentimes that's because a lot of the really novel interesting ideas come from you know different fields interacting come from people from other fields actually addressing a problem in a new way so you know basically agreeing agreeing with day in here yeah yeah let's move into some questions asking about the types of research that that are be like to see what is about basic research you know if someone is planning to conduct research that starting to set with basic materials research that may lead to eventual application is that in the RP you will help I would say if you can draw the correlation to the application yes research for research sake is not what we do we do translational research to technology so if it's a super-duper electrolyte just going to enable fast charging those batteries that's that's definitely of interest and if it's still pretty early but there's good foundation for for the technology I think we'd be interested and the other thing is to realize that we've had two types of funding mechanisms we do a seed funding which is typically under a million and then we do a full on which funding which is anywhere between an outside 2 and 7 million yeah so I mean in that case right a seed is normally something where there isn't a lot of data existing some ideas and we're really funding a proof of concept which looks a little bit more like you know the really more closer to fundamental research but obviously very much application-oriented the bigger projects were really looking for the you know the first real demonstration that what we thought could write with what you Scott you could accomplish with this technology is actually possible normally that's like a lab-scale demonstration and so you know either of those is ok right RPE kind of sits within the Department of Energy we have we have the office of science which is doing really fundamental science we've got you know the applied programs like eere which are really funding you know larger scale demonstrations etc we can play anywhere in between and I think Danes initial comment is probably the most important one which is as long as you can draw a connection between the research and development you're doing and a potential impact in one of our mission areas you're in good shape great I think Jane mentioned and during the presentation about how long we fund we typically fund something once and some we have a question here saying for truly innovative technologies that might meet or exceed our p's mission goals but will require a considerable amount of research to prove viability the basic concepts behind that technology is that something how would our ve think about something that was proposed the kind of is upfront acknowledging that there's a lot of research needed here to to get there even if the potential impact is is big and significant and it's in the mission area yeah I mean I think it's a good question i mean you know generally speaking I think we think about this a lot when we construct the programs right we're trying to put out a problem statement where we think that we can you know the proposals we get in will be such that we can fund you know great world-class teams for two to three years on the order of you know as most work you know we'll be putting in you know five six million dollars and you know we're going to try and construct problem statement such that we feel like by funding that we're going to actually move the needle in whether this is a feasible solution or not and move it towards impact and so normally you know that's the sweet spot right now I don't know if dan has any other thoughts on it yeah I mean I guess the way I look at it is it's our function as an agency is de-risking and so if the technology concept has a twenty percent chance of success and rpe could take it to an 80 but there's still ninety percent of the work left in terms of funding we will have done our job our you know our job is not to fund the technology all the way to a product our job is to be risk it and show whether or not it's possible if we've done that successfully we have accomplished what are sort of our goal is so we you know we don't fund long-term what we'll do though is work with programs if they show a lot of potential and they can d risk some of the key scientific challenges work with some of the other agencies whether it's in DoD from of Defense or other agencies within department of energy to get them follow-on funding to take it to the next stage following up on the idea of incremental versus transformative one question was Elon referring to your example slides up at the beginning you know either the more you know fun examples of 10x you know coffee filtration you know kind of but there the person is asking you know that's great you know if this efficiently improvement is 10x that that's an  example but what about how do we think about incremental versus transformative as the technology improves heat transfer efficiency by 3x is that incremental or transformative and maybe you could just kind of talk about how would we you know more define what we mean by transformational and if it is it just you know it's not the delorean you know there's gradations back from the delorean where we see transformational yeah i mean my answer would be pretty simple in the sense of you know we've got three mission areas we're looking for technologies where if they're successful they can move the needle significant advances in one of those and i use the example you know what we think in terms of quads here right so you know if you want to know kind of what's significant its quads or quads equivalent of whatever you're talking about you know the example that you gave adam of just heat transfer generally yeah i think raises the question of well what if it's a platform technology and the connection is not just okay for this specific application I threat I've developed a better or solar panel and so now we have better you know solar power generation you know heat transfer could have impacts across a lot of different applications and that's okay and those could be very big opportunities for impact normally when we set up a program description and solicitation will try and point out that different application areas that we think are relevant and and where the impact is going to come from but as an applicant you should you should draw that connection yourselves and as long as you feel like there's a credible story drawing the connection between your advanced and making those big impacts that's great I don't think there's any issue there and I'm just on to score for our listeners angle on that read the FOA no really a lot of effort goes into that and I think a lot of the questions that we receive during the live broadcast were about how can we understand what RV is looking for how can we understand you know what the goal is when the metrics are and NRP puts a lot of effort into crafting the funding opportunity announcements to give that guy that's very clearly yeah I mean Dana talked about all the different all the different internal reviews we go through for project selection and we also go through a bunch of rounds of reviews for what the program description looks like so a lot of thought has gone into every line in those program descriptions right do market projections play a role in either the development of foa's or in your review and evaluation of proposals ah yeah i bet that detective I think it's phrased in a tough way so my take on this you know is we we very consciously have decided that we want to make an impact we want there to be a credible path from the technology demonstration to some impact as an applicant we don't expect you to have knowledge about you know the nitty-gritty of a commercial space or commercial acumen and so we're going to take our knowledge base our thinking about the program look at your technology and and if we believe there's potential for that impact that's good enough I don't I don't think people should should feel as though they need to have some you know business plan in the back of their head when they propose they may have some no I agree with that and you know its technology first the impact obviously at a high level has to be there but you know we don't expect you know Marcus projections to be critical part of an application yeah I'm it may be an example there is you know we've got a program on you know we see our role is as kind of developing technology options right right and towards our mission areas right at RB we can't control things like policy things like markets so we want to keep we try and keep them in mind but they're they're not necessarily hard filters on what we're doing great I on the spirit of options one question comes SS in the most recent open fo I had over 50 subtopics how do you manage deciding impact and one sub topic being more important than another you know and weighing through all of those and not you know just for everyone listening we can't comment specifically on open pro but just at a process level strategically how do you go about balancing choosing between the well I mean I write generally speaking it's not you know we're not comparing these proposals to one another in most cases right within specifically in our review process we're reviewing each proposal on the merits and thinking about you know how does that align with what we're looking for and so there might be 57 subgroups you know it's not like we need a fund that you know not Noah's Ark here we don't need to fund two in each subgroup and so right i mean i'd say you know I'd say it's pretty easy to distinguish because we're just looking at he once each one saying is this our PE or not is that yeah I agree I mean we look for impact you know certainly within the field but also more broadly and so yeah I would say it just depends on the quality of the proposal and the quality of the technical idea you know it could be if it really transformative in biofuels for example and advanced that field biofuels we recognize as being potentially impactful and RP mission areas would it be as big of an improvement as ten percent increase in solar panel efficiency it's hard to stay it's an emerging field so we generally just take the approaches as Ilan said of not picking sort of technological approaches but but creating technological options yeah I mean one thing to keep in mind is when you when you read our solicitations we normally have the review criteria that the reviewers are using and that we're using to assess project proposals and then there's something there that talks about basically you know program policy factors one of which often stubbe it usually ends up being sort of a balance of different approaches or different ideas and i think that the important point there is we do think about sort of balancing things in portfolios in the sense of you know right if we look at something in a very conventional area you know something that we know the the industry is already focused on we might look at those proposals slightly differently than if we have a proposal where we said wow we didn't even know that problem existed right and so you know this proposal out something about it that's really special and different and that might make it stand out or be unique okay well thank you both very much for today's presentation and I know we have a lot of other questions that we can't get to today but continue to tune in for future editions of our be University will continue to find ways to to bring you webinars on topics that can help you and your own work RVE has limited funds we do attempt to fund the best technologies but we know there are more ideas and there are dollars and so this is our effort here is to help give some support and encouragement to everyone but we can't give you money but we can hope to give you guidance and making your technology successful so that's all from RP until next time
