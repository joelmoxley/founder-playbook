Funding applications often require something shorter than a research paper, but more substantive than a business pitchâ€”you need a technical pitch. ARPA-E Program Directors Dane Boysen and Ilan Gur share their five best practices and five deadly sins for writing technical proposals. Participants will also learn about ARPA-E's mission and unique role in funding energy innovation. While the webinar uses concepts from the ARPA-E funding selection process, the proposal strategies are applicable to anyone attempting to communicate complex technical information in a short format.

welcome to today's edition of arpae University winning technical pitches with Dane boyston in de la mujer.
this is a fourth and intended series of practical seminars on core concepts and skills to help transition breakthrough technologies into successful commercial products.
RPG university was first launched at the 2012 RPE Energy Innovation Summit and we are pleased to announce that registration is now available for the 2013 RPE summit and more information can be found at ww RPE summit com
you have ideas for topics for speakers that you'd like to see featured in future editions of RPG University, please contact us to suggest those and we look to craft this series in a way that helps our community by providing research best practices and and lectures. so we look forward to your suggestions.
today's presentation is a 30 minute overview followed by a discussion of QA. since this is a rerecording we will be using QA that was submitted during our live presentation on october third and we'll be selecting questions for the discussion with dr. gore and dr. boyson today. 
and I'll now introduce dr. Dane boysen who currently serves as an rfe program director. his main focuses include electrochemical energy conversion and storage natural gas conversion and storage technology and materials for energy storage and conversion. prior to joining our for a dr. boyston led the development of a grid scale energy storage liquid metal battery at MIT under professional Donald Sadoway and dr. languor, also program director here. at our PE is technical focus areas include electrical and thermal energy storage an advanced
1:45battery management solar energy and new
1:48materials for energy conversion and
1:50storage it also serves as the senior
1:52technical advisor helping our pease
1:54technology to market effort which
1:56focuses on preparing breakthrough energy
1:58technologies for the transition from lab
2:01to market including programs like
2:03today's RB university dr. gore has spent
2:05his career developing and
2:06commercializing clean energy
2:07technologies based on advances and
2:09material science prior to RP
2:12he served as co-founder and director of
2:13co a venture-backed Libyan bad up
2:16startup company dr. gore thanks so much
2:19Adam and thanks everyone who is joining
2:21us today you know just a quick sort of
2:26overview in terms of how this program
2:28came about you know the Adams just
2:32provided some nice introductions to dana
2:34myself you know the only and probably
2:37most important thing you need to know is
2:38that you know we're two of the folks
2:39here who end up reading all the
2:42proposals that come in and making
2:44decisions on what we're going to fund
2:45and basically you know we spend a lot of
2:49time as a team here at our PE you know
2:52together talking about our process
2:53talking about things that are going well
2:56and not well and and after reviewing a
2:58bunch of proposals you know this was the
3:00product of us sitting around you know
3:02and some of us saying you know what I
3:03really hate when when i'm looking at
3:06proposals you know this is really bother
3:07bother me this could have potentially
3:09been a great great proposal but the
3:12proposal came in this XY and z form and
3:15and that really you have stalked and
3:17then you know gained might respond and
3:19say oh but you know what i really love
3:20to see and we sort of have this
3:22conversation and then we said to
3:24ourselves well why should we keep this
3:25to ourselves you know if we share this
3:27community hopefully that lets everyone
3:29do a better job of submitting things
3:34that are in line with what we're looking
3:35for so that that's kind of the
3:36motivation is to help you all in the
3:40process there's a slide up here just
3:43just to emphasize what you're going to
3:46hear today is basically the views of
3:48dane and myself we think they're pretty
3:51representative of you know what's the
3:54set of program directors here at RBE
3:56kind of the way we think the way we
3:58perceive proposals what we're looking
4:01for but definitely definitely the one
4:03thing to keep in mind is you know if we
4:05have a solicitation out read the
4:07solicitation the solicitation describes
4:09in detail exactly what to say what
4:11criteria we're going to use to choose
4:13projects etc and so this should just be
4:15considered more of a broad general set
4:18of set of thoughts and guidance so you
4:23know one of the key points I think we'll
4:24make today
4:25is ya in the question of what's a
4:29winning pitch really depends on who is
4:31receiving the pitch and you know
4:34generally speaking honing a message to
4:36an audience is important so we figured
4:38Before we jump into our thoughts on on
4:40goods and bads in proposals rpe we
4:43should just give you a quick background
4:44on RB e which i think is relevant as
4:47many folks know arbys a very new agency
4:50we sit within the Department of Energy
4:53and the very short history of RB if we
4:57rewind back most folks know that RB is
4:59modeled after DARPA DARPA was created
5:04during the Sputnik days when folks you
5:08know basically you know we're watching
5:10satellite go through the sky and said
5:12you know hey that's not our technology
5:14maybe we're falling behind in some
5:16critical technologies for defense fast
5:19forward to 2016 above the Gathering
5:21Storm report from the National Academies
5:24there was another sense that you know
5:26here we are if we look at energy
5:27technologies this is a really critical
5:29wave of innovation that's that's coming
5:32globally it has implications to our
5:35environmental security our Economic
5:37Security our national security and we
5:39may be falling behind and so r peu is
5:42basically established to be a DARPA like
5:44agency for energy probably the most
5:47important thing for you folks on this
5:50slide is you know since our first
5:53funding in 2009 we've basically been
5:56operating at a run rate of about two
5:58hundred million dollars a year on
5:59average and we're at the heart on R&D
6:03funding agency so that boast of that
6:05money is going out to researchers
6:08through open competitive solicitations
6:12this is probably the most important
6:15slide on the background if there's
6:17anything to keep in mind about our PE
6:19it's that we have a very very clear
6:21mission from Congress it's spelled out
6:23in our statute our goal is to develop
6:26not the incremental technologies so not
6:28things that already exist on today's
6:31technology roadmaps but really over the
6:33horizon high impact disruptive we like
6:36use the words game-changing technologies
6:39but specifically with three goals one is
6:42to reduce the USS dependence on foreign
6:45energy sources one is to improve energy
6:48efficiency in the US and the third is to
6:50reduce emissions related to energy use
6:52and so these three goals really serve as
6:55a hard filter for us when we're looking
6:58at things we may want to fund if it
7:01doesn't fit at least one of these
7:02mission areas we generally will not
7:04touch it when we build programs that are
7:08PE there are a number of elements that
7:10we're looking for and I think this is
7:13reflected in the way we review proposals
7:15as well the first thing that we care
7:18about and one of the most important
7:21things is the question of impact and we
7:23basically asked ourselves in a program
7:25if the set of technologies we can fund
7:27in this program succeed will they make
7:30not a small impact but a significant
7:33impact and specifically a significant
7:35impact on one of our mission areas and
7:36so that's a really key piece I'd say
7:39similarly important is the second point
7:42here which is the question of is this a
7:45transformative technology and basically
7:49there we're really looking for new ideas
7:51we're looking for different approaches
7:53we're looking for things which you know
7:55i like to say have some innovative spark
7:57in them and so that we think this is
8:01something that has the opportunity to
8:02disrupt the way things are done today
8:05thirdly we're looking for things that
8:08create bridges bridges between science
8:10and technology I think one of the
8:12important bridges is you know creating
8:15bridges to to provide research to the
8:18areas which were you know in today are
8:21islands and not you know not finding
8:24support elsewhere in terms of rd support
8:28and so that's an important one and then
8:31finally you know i think this is true
8:33everyone's looking for a great team in
8:36our case we're looking for teams that
8:40possess all of the different qualities
8:43that you need to address the major
8:45technical
8:47that that you're overcoming in your in
8:50your technical project so so these are
8:52the key areas we're looking for and I
8:54think you'll find us refer back to them
8:56over the course of the next half an hour
8:58as we go through this presentation so
9:01that's some background on our PE we
9:04decided you know we were going to
9:06basically tell you about five things
9:08that we hate to see in five things that
9:10we love to see we're going to start them
9:13on the on the bad side and then and then
9:16Dane will pick it up and and hopefully
9:18give some more uplifting comments you
9:21know so this is a little cheeky here but
9:23we basically say you know thou shall not
9:25submit a proposal that is these things
9:28and again you know these are the things
9:30where you know that that keep us up at
9:32night after we've been reviewing
9:33proposals that we say wow that really
9:35frustrated me about x y&z proposals so
9:37let me just jump into these so the first
9:41and this relates to that impact right
9:44criteria that we're looking for the
9:47first is a proposal that we just see is
9:48insignificant and a few things could go
9:50wrong here one is you can just basically
9:53that the proposal may not do a good
9:55enough job showing a connection between
9:58success and the project to what the
9:59impact would be on the mission areas so
10:01sometimes it's just the way it's written
10:03we don't see a strong connection but
10:06then there are two manifestations of
10:07this that tend to arise that I think are
10:10worth pointing out so I just threw a
10:12couple examples here right so here's an
10:15example of a proposal we might get which
10:17talks about a really novel exciting new
10:20membrane technology that's going to make
10:22better coffee filters and basically this
10:26technology is going to improve the
10:28efficiency of coffee filtration I 10x
10:31right and that's going to impact over
10:34100 million you know citizens in the US
10:36who drink coffee every day and so you
10:38know right what we find here is this is
10:42actually you know this is a huge
10:44improvement at 10x improvement it is a
10:46big deal and potentially it could be a
10:48big deal to any given coffee maker right
10:52but while there's a big improvement here
10:54there's not necessarily a big impact
10:56right and you know what we will do in
10:58almost every proposal
11:00is say well let's add up and see how it
11:02affects our mission area and in this
11:04case okay this is ten times more you
11:07know more efficient coffee makers so
11:09let's look at how many people in the
11:10u.s. own a coffee maker let's look at
11:11how often they're used let's look at
11:13that electricity savings will convert it
11:16back into primary energy savings and we
11:20generally want to see a significant
11:22impact which to us means you know we
11:23need to be on the order of quads right
11:25we need to be in percentages or multiple
11:27percentages of total u.s. primary energy
11:29consumption production emissions and
11:34here obviously we're not going to get to
11:36that to that scale so so this wouldn't
11:39pass the significant impact test a
11:42different type of example I have here is
11:45so this is an interesting one okay so
11:48now we've got a new hydrogels technology
11:50that allows you to create a super diaper
11:52which you use the diaper you flash it
11:55very quickly with UV light and all of a
11:57sudden you know it's kind of fully
11:59degradable it can dissolve in water in
12:0130 seconds versus a typical dipole which
12:04would be you know many many years and in
12:07this case the impact is obviously really
12:08really big right this could save you
12:11know 18 billion diapers for an entering
12:13US landfills each year and so you know
12:16this is the type of proposal that comes
12:18into our PE where any individual program
12:20director might say you know i would love
12:22to fund this this is a very high impact
12:24project and then we think about it and
12:26we say the unfortunate thing here is
12:29that it has a big impact but it's not a
12:31big impact on one of our mission areas
12:33right so our PE does not have the
12:34mission of saving you know municipal
12:37waste and and this isn't related to
12:40energy efficiency foreign energy sources
12:42emissions or at least not in a big
12:44enough way and so you know this is kind
12:47of a you know a fail in terms of trying
12:50to seek funding from our be so
12:52insignificant is the first one second is
12:56indistinguishable and basically you know
12:59this kind of goes to that novelty piece
13:02you might give us a proposal which
13:04actually has you know technically sound
13:07could have a very big impact but we may
13:09know that in your field of
13:11there are 30 other projects or 30 other
13:13teams around the country that are
13:15working on something very similar and so
13:19then the question is well what why
13:22should we be funding this specific
13:25proposal and if there are 30 other
13:27groups doing similar work directionally
13:30you haven't really told us enough of
13:32what you're doing different such that
13:33you couldn't you know why aren't you
13:34being funded by the same folks who are
13:36funding all the other folks around the
13:38world that are doing this work and so
13:40you really want to think about
13:41differentiation and say you know here's
13:44exactly what makes it different not just
13:46from the way things are being done today
13:48but also from other competing kind of
13:50emerging technology approaches around
13:53around the world so the third here is
13:57incremental and you know the picture
13:59here is is sort of you know just meant
14:01to be a metaphor right there are a lot
14:04of base hits that can be important but
14:08RP is an agency is not set up to fund
14:11based hits we're set up to fund projects
14:13which are looking for home runs and so
14:15oftentimes we will get proposals in that
14:19you know could potentially have a good
14:21impact could even be novel and creative
14:24but we basically say you know what the
14:28what they're actually asking us to fund
14:30we feel pretty confident that they'll be
14:32able to do it and you know if there's a
14:35high degree of confidence that the
14:37technical proposal the technical program
14:39will succeed there are probably that
14:42applies there are probably a number of
14:44sources of funding available for a low
14:46risk project right and so we want to put
14:50our p.e money into things where there
14:52aren't other sources of funding
14:53available largely because you know no
14:56one no one's willing to consider funding
14:58this proposal because it's sort of so
15:00out there so high risk so you know
15:02really sort of swinging for the fences
15:04and so it's something to keep in mind is
15:08if it seems like this is a low risk it
15:10seems like you're you're definitely
15:12going to succeed in the technical
15:13approach that that might not go over
15:16well when when we're looking at the
15:18proposal
15:20next one is incoherent we get a lot of
15:25proposals from top researchers and top
15:28practitioners around the country and
15:31that's great occasionally we run into
15:34this situation where we actually have a
15:37team with several you know all-stars
15:39superstars you know best in their field
15:42but then we start oh that's exciting and
15:45then we start reading the proposal and
15:46basically we see that it almost looks
15:49like these three or four individuals
15:51that are each amazing in their field
15:53each wrote a section of the proposal
15:55based on their knowledge base and then
15:58someone staples all together and
15:59submitted it if so the analogy here is
16:02you know if you look at this picture of
16:03the Jazz Band now these all might be
16:05world-class jazz players and yet if
16:08they're not coordinated and they don't
16:11have an align vision and they haven't
16:12practiced together I mean everyone looks
16:14kind of confused in this picture right
16:16the outcome could end up being pretty
16:17sloppy and we feel the same way about
16:20proposals if we don't feel like there's
16:21a cohesive vision around a project and a
16:24leader that's driving that vision among
16:26among a team that's working together
16:28that worries us quite a bit and that can
16:30be something that kind of kills a
16:32coastal proposal and then the fifth year
16:36is a particularly frustrating situation
16:40I put here you know it should not be
16:42indefinite which basically you know we
16:45oftentimes get proposals that have all
16:47of the right claims you know the very
16:49high impact seemed innovative etc and
16:52yet once we start reading we realized
16:54there's actually no detail on the
16:57technology being proposed and so I put
17:00an example here of sort of a good way
17:03and a bad way to do this and starting
17:06with the bad right so this is you know
17:07you'll recognize this picture from from
17:09Back to the Future this is the DeLorean
17:10time machine and you know we might get a
17:13proposal that says okay here's a
17:14next-generation vehicle allows for you
17:16know very energy efficient time travel
17:18ten times more efficient time travel to
17:20any date time place in the history of
17:22the Union universe wow that's huge a big
17:25impact and then you know they might say
17:27the technology leverage is novel
17:28proprietary technology from doc in the
17:30fly industries inc say okay
17:33interesting and it's been validated a
17:36proof of concept scale by these industry
17:38advisors who include several Nobel
17:40laureates and they're all fantastic
17:41right and and that's great but you
17:43haven't actually told us what we're
17:46talking about and we can't make a
17:48decision to fund something without any
17:49information and so sort of on the flip
17:52side here you know we would rather have
17:54this look like you know you'll notice
17:56the first bullet point here is the same
17:57major claim right which is great but
18:01then with it you know the proposal would
18:03say okay this is a next-generation flux
18:05capacitor based on x y&z alloy um you'll
18:09notice they don't have to give us any
18:10composition details they're just telling
18:12us you know something about the
18:13technology and you know here's some
18:16unhear some reason some rationale as to
18:19why the technology can give us the
18:22effect that we're claiming and ideally
18:24you have got some references there and
18:26then you know time travel requires 1.21
18:29gigawatts of power and you know we've
18:32actually done a full mass and energy
18:34balance outlined in the table right so
18:36we want to see supporting evidence we
18:38want to see it through references we
18:39want to see it through data if you're
18:41worried about proprietary pneus if
18:44you're worried about giving up you know
18:47we don't want you folks to be giving up
18:49trade secrets etc you need to give some
18:52amount of detail in your proposal and so
18:54I'd say that's a bit of a cost of doing
18:56business but you'll notice in this case
18:59you know you can give a lot of
19:00supporting evidence without you know
19:03going into for instance the composition
19:05the specific composition you know you
19:07can provide data and you know sometimes
19:10you might leave out some of the pieces
19:11of the axes but call out specifically if
19:14you're leaving out information or you're
19:16not telling us something because you're
19:17worried about it being proprietary call
19:19that out so we understand why we're not
19:22getting full information and and we can
19:25find ways to deal with that but
19:27otherwise if you just don't tell us
19:28anything it's very hard for us to
19:30justify fun you know funding that that's
19:32a puzzle so you know this is just you
19:36know in review the five pieces of the
19:39deadly sins we describe the one thing
19:41I'd say is we occasionally get proposals
19:45where it
19:46seems pretty clear that the folks who
19:48are proposed we're proposing looked at
19:51all of the things that are pg wants to
19:52see in a proposal and basically sort of
19:56tailored the proposals to sound like you
19:59know they've really hit it out of the
20:00park on every access that we're looking
20:01for and so the one thing to keep in mind
20:03is you know this is generally these are
20:06the things we're looking for you know
20:07for instance if you think of impacted
20:09novelty oftentimes you know those two
20:11things are a bit at odds right we might
20:14have a very very poser that could be
20:15very high impact potentially but not so
20:18novel or less novel or a proposal that
20:20is a bit less high impact but the
20:24novelty is so interesting that we say
20:26you know we really need to fund this
20:27it's going to change the way people
20:28think about this entire field what we
20:31don't like to see his proposals that
20:32basically sort of try and work it so
20:35that everything looks incredible and so
20:37what I'd say is the sort of last deadly
20:40sin is you know be sincere don't be
20:43insincere in the proposal we'd rather
20:44have you tell us really what the
20:46strengths are and what the potential
20:47weaknesses are and and will respect that
20:50generally versus you know we will notice
20:55if a proposal just seems kind of part of
20:57the proposal really seems kind of out
20:58there and really sort of revved up to
21:02match what we're looking for it tends to
21:04not go over very well so that's that's
21:07my piece and I'm going to hand it over
21:09to deign to talk about some of the
21:12things we'd love to see in proposals and
21:14I think he's going to start by going
21:16through just a little bit of a
21:19description on on what the review
21:21process looks like at RBE to kind of
21:24help help guide that conversation thank
21:28you Elon I appreciate that Elon
21:30definitely hit home I think my
21:33sentiments on things that we don't like
21:36to see when we're reading proposals and
21:39hopefully now I can give you a little
21:41bit of background on things we like to
21:43see first I think it's probably useful
21:46to to go over what the process is our PE
21:53in terms of reviewing proposals to give
21:55you some perspective
21:58we we move very quickly the first thing
22:00to realize it the way RP works is that
22:04it's a what we call a program director
22:07driven agency both Elan and I come from
22:11other places where short term and in
22:14every program director at RP has a term
22:17limit of about three years which means
22:20that we have the very little time to
22:23start a program get it up review it and
22:26and then get it underway and the way it
22:30works is that once we started our PE we
22:34immediately begin doing a deep technical
22:37dies and trying to identify white space
22:39we hold a workshop or two to flush it
22:43out and then develop a program and then
22:46internally we pitch the program to the
22:51other program directors and the director
22:53of our PE and if its well-received then
22:57we will launch a follow up that entire
22:59process is somewhere between two and
23:02four months and once the BOA is released
23:07then typically we receive concepts or
23:12requests concept papers as a first stage
23:14a couple of pages a review of your your
23:17idea and then that those concept papers
23:21are reviewed by external reviewers
23:23typically it three external reviewers we
23:29are not a rack and stack for
23:31organization we don't we are not
23:33required to use what the reviewers or
23:36take the reviewers comments and select
23:41only those with high reviews we have the
23:43ability as program directors to use the
23:47reviewers inputs as as advice but can
23:51select programs or projects that did not
23:57score well in the review from the
24:01reviewers once we make sort of
24:04preliminary selections both at the
24:07concept paper and the
24:09full paper phase we have to we have what
24:13we call it in America Review Board which
24:16is an internal process in which we go
24:19through every single program that we
24:21would like to select our every single
24:24project we would like to select for a
24:26program and then have to defend that in
24:32front of the other people on the review
24:35board so there there is a lot of
24:37internal checks and by the time we
24:40actually make our selections of whole
24:42proposals we usually know the project's
24:45pretty well because we actually have to
24:47descend project internally so if if you
24:53have gotten the project funded
24:54congratulations it means that a program
24:56director championed your project within
24:58our PE so that's I think important to
25:01realize when you're applying the RV is
25:04that that projects are picked up by the
25:07program directors so that's sort of the
25:11first first point now sort of just
25:14getting into what we like to see I this
25:19is just an example of an interesting
25:22paper that I took as a model it's not
25:25it's not illustrated of a technology
25:28that we particularly like to see but
25:30about more about how to write your sort
25:36of i would say particularly concept
25:38paper phase so as to have the best
25:44chance of being selected for full
25:45application and they're there you know
25:48there are a number of things that i
25:52think you can do that could really help
25:54you make that leap you should understand
25:59that in so in many cases we read
26:02hundreds of concept papers in the full
26:07or in the open for the first open flat
26:10there were four thousand almost four
26:13thousand applications which means that
26:15there were 12,000 reviews so it's
26:20it's a mind-numbing Lee large number of
26:22reviews to be done and at some point you
26:27know the program directors read through
26:28all those ones that they end up picking
26:30up so we read a lot of these things and
26:33so my this is as I said just a prototype
26:37example with a formula for you to help
26:42you pitch your technology to rbe so the
26:47first point first thing that we like
26:51seeing is described the technology
26:54innovation in the first sentence get to
26:57the point fast we read a lot of these
26:59things and we're all it RPE as program
27:02directors very technically capable we
27:04usually understand the problem pretty
27:07pretty well and what we like to see and
27:11we're really looking for is at least in
27:14the concept paper is the technology
27:16what's the technology what's new and
27:18innovative about your idea and that
27:21should be right up front so here in this
27:23case of the fluorine ion battery we put
27:28it right up at front we propose we
27:30propose we propose a rechargeable
27:33fluorine ion battery that uses
27:34solid-state fluorine ion conductor with
27:37metal fluorine electrodes so now I know
27:40right away what exactly the idea of the
27:44proposal is going to be around the
27:46second thing we like to see and it's
27:49incredibly useful in reviewing
27:52applications is is is visual aid so
27:56providing a visual aid that gives an
27:58idea of your technology directly after
28:02the first paragraph is extremely useful
28:05again we have to digest information very
28:07quickly because just the sheer volume of
28:09applications that we have so it doesn't
28:13have to be a super pretty picture it but
28:16it does need to be illustrative of
28:17what's happening in your technology oh
28:20it's a visual aids to help us digest the
28:25concept of what you're proposing so
28:28that's the second thing
28:29the third thing is in any new technology
28:36you should backup your your claims with
28:39some liminary data and if you don't have
28:42liminary data there should definitely be
28:44very strong scientific rationalization
28:47for why you think the technology should
28:49work so in this case we put some women
28:51ery charge-discharge cycles with a
28:53fluorine rechargeable fluorine ion
28:56batteries and so this we often get stuff
29:01with pretty pretty pretty big claims but
29:05there's but there's no nothing to back
29:07it up so claims are okay it's either you
29:11have data or you go through
29:13scientifically why what you're proposing
29:17is possible this is this is pretty
29:20critical so this is after we understand
29:22the idea this is the next thing we
29:24really look for is what is what is the
29:27justification for that idea okay or we
29:36generally do have a good idea where the
29:38state of the yard is however it is
29:41important to compare yourself to the
29:44state of the yard right up front in this
29:48case we set the example given the solid
29:52state fluorine ion batteries have a
29:57theoretical energy density of 792
30:00watt-hours per kilogram which compares
30:03favorably to lithium ion batteries at
30:05568 watt-hours per kilogram so here
30:09we've kind of shown right away that from
30:11a theoretical standpoint this battery is
30:13promising and this is basically what
30:16we're looking for we one might argue
30:20that your technology is so radical that
30:25there is nothing to compare it to for
30:28example you developed the first cell
30:30phone and there's only landlines in this
30:33case you should compare it to landlines
30:35this actually does help your proposal
30:39and demonstrating how radical it is
30:42so there always is some state of the art
30:46that can that there is that you should
30:48compare to to give us an idea of where
30:50the impact is okay last but not least
31:00after you've set up what the technical
31:04technological innovation is and you've
31:08said why it's you think it's possible or
31:10given some data the next question that's
31:13always on our mind is why hasn't someone
31:15done this before and so the next the
31:20last sort of thing we really like to see
31:22is a clear identification of what the
31:24technical challenges are why is this
31:27program risky that is and what's going
31:29to be your approach to solving them why
31:31why is it that you are going to be able
31:34to solve this problem and no one else
31:35has so we would get an example here you
31:38know several key challenges remain to
31:41demonstrating a viable chlorine ion
31:44battery including XYZ and then these are
31:48our approaches to solving those problems
31:50so this this is that the last thing in
31:53terms of if you've hit these sort of
31:55five high level items I think you all
31:59have gone a long ways to putting
32:01yourself forward as a winning winning
32:03proposal so just to start summarized in
32:09applying or preparing your technical
32:13pitch these are sort of the five things
32:17best practices one gets get to the point
32:20quickly what the technological
32:22innovation is to provide a visual aid
32:26that helps us and digesting what that
32:28innovation is three backup your data or
32:32give a strong rationale a strong
32:35rational and scientific rationalization
32:37why you think this is possible stay for
32:40say where you are relative to the state
32:42of the art and last identify the
32:44technical challenges so this is this
32:51advice is pretty focused on concept
32:53paper phase a lot of these elements
32:56translate to the full application phase
32:58I think it's important for you to take a
33:04look at what we call the hilum i er
33:07catechism when just after you complete
33:12your application going through this list
33:15of questions George hi Lamar was the
33:17DARPA director from nineteen seventy
33:19five to nineteen seventy-seven he helped
33:22develop digital displays I and he came
33:29up with this list of questions for for
33:31DARPA directors when they first started
33:34and every RPE director gets a copy of
33:38these questions when they start and
33:40these are the questions that we ask
33:42ourselves about our programs and we also
33:44ask these about every individual project
33:47so when you go through your application
33:50I would recommend that you take a look
33:54at these questions and ask if you've
33:56answered them very completely and
34:00they're pretty straightforward you know
34:02what is it you're trying to do and it
34:04articulated with no jargon how is it
34:08done today what's new about your
34:11approach often the most difficult one
34:14who cares why should we care about about
34:17what you're doing and if you're
34:20successful what's the impact that it
34:22will make how much will it cost how long
34:24is it going to take you know what you
34:28know we don't fund typically projects
34:30more than one time so at the end of us
34:36funding your project where will you be
34:39so what are the exams that let us know
34:42that you've been successful so these are
34:44really critical if you can go through
34:47these questions and and feel like you
34:50answered them completely within the
34:52context of the rpe mission I think
34:55you'll be on your way to having a
34:58winning application to RP
35:01and that's it I think we'll now move to
35:04questions great thank you very much
35:06staying any lawn and again today is a
35:09rerecording and we're using the
35:11questions that were submitted during our
35:13live broadcast and to start I wanted to
35:15go back to the issue of teens and ilan
35:18you talked about the kind of challenge
35:20if you've got superstars that don't seem
35:22that they have coordinated several of
35:24our questions asked you know what are
35:25the chances if you have a pure company
35:28as a very short history or maybe you're
35:32a less experienced investigator your
35:35assistant professor you know how
35:37important is experienced in putting the
35:41team together and how you guys look at
35:43those projects uh so this is a lot I
35:48mean I think it's a I think it's a good
35:50question I'd start by saying you know
35:53generally speaking we talked about
35:54wanting to fund the best ideas sort of
35:57regardless of where they come from and
35:59so if you look at where r be projects
36:02get funded you know some are in academia
36:04some are in National Labs nonprofits
36:07traditional small businesses large
36:09company research groups and so you know
36:13we generally don't try not to have any
36:16biases really coming in to to what type
36:19of experience you need to have I think
36:22the two things that we look out really
36:24strongly one that I mentioned is if we
36:27line up all of the technical risks of a
36:29project to the team have the
36:33capabilities and expertise to address
36:37all of the different types of risks so
36:38if your project has a chemical a
36:41chemistry component and electrical
36:44electrical engineering component do you
36:46have a strong chemist in a strong
36:47electrical engineer you know in terms of
36:51experience I think you know we
36:54definitely need to see right summit we
36:56have some expertise in some capabilities
36:58I don't think you can answer that across
37:01the the bad experience obviously helps
37:03in demonstrating capabilities of
37:05expertise but I don't think it's you
37:07know having right someone on your team
37:10that has 50 years of experience and it
37:12is just sort of you know
37:14the Guru in the field and that's that's
37:16in no way a necessary component of a
37:19winning proposal and oftentimes some of
37:20the best new innovative ideas and some
37:23of the sort of hungriest most aggressive
37:25p is our younger folks with less
37:28experience I don't know Dean might have
37:29some other I I completely agree with
37:31Ilan I mean we get a lot of proposals to
37:34say or I've read a lot to say you know
37:37were the experts in this field funda
37:40hahaha so those don't hold a lot of
37:44water at RTE if you're an expert you
37:47better show it through the quality of
37:49your application not through saying that
37:51you're the expert that's that this holds
37:54no water here and I think I completely
37:58agree with you on some of the more
37:59innovative proposals come from the
38:01people that I would say a little on the
38:02less experienced side that doesn't mean
38:05that ultimately when you start to build
38:08out your team you shouldn't start to
38:09filled out some expertise that you're
38:12going to need to be successful but
38:16absolutely it's about the idea yeah I
38:20all just had one last thing I mean you
38:22know when we think about right we talked
38:24about the big things that are P is
38:25looking for you'll notice you know
38:27potential impact was huge novelty was
38:29huge right disruptive but we obviously
38:33care about will it succeed but it's
38:35actually rotor on the list you right
38:37into the question of you know trying to
38:40hit a home run is actually more
38:41important than you know do you have the
38:4450 years of experience that will know
38:45you're going to accomplish it
38:46successfully right one might argue with
38:49all your 50 years experience you haven't
38:51done it yet there might be a
38:55disadvantage follow up on the teeming is
38:59some co Sebastian a desert but you
39:01prefers the industrial applicants rather
39:03than academic ones or are there specific
39:06requirements and combinations of
39:07industry and university you might want
39:10to comment on if there are preferences
39:12or FS
39:13agnostic i would say completely agnostic
39:16we you know a line I think hits the nail
39:20on the head we found ideas I don't care
39:22where they come from yeah I think one of
39:24one of the maybe misconceptions I think
39:27people sometimes people come to us and
39:29say well we know we need to be teaming
39:32you know with industry we know that we
39:34need to be teaming with other we need
39:35multidisciplinary projects to succeed at
39:38our PE and actually I think there might
39:40be correlation there but not causation
39:41in the sense that you know a lot of the
39:44teams we do fund have a
39:46multidisciplinary component have
39:47industry works of academia but
39:50oftentimes that's because a lot of the
39:52really novel interesting ideas come from
39:54you know different fields interacting
39:56come from people from other fields
39:58actually addressing a problem in a new
40:00way so you know basically agreeing
40:04agreeing with day in here yeah yeah
40:07let's move into some questions asking
40:10about the types of research that that
40:12are be like to see what is about basic
40:16research you know if someone is planning
40:18to conduct research that starting to set
40:20with basic materials research that may
40:22lead to eventual application is that in
40:25the RP you will help I would say if you
40:29can draw the correlation to the
40:31application yes research for research
40:35sake is not what we do we do
40:37translational research to technology so
40:41if it's a super-duper electrolyte just
40:45going to enable fast charging those
40:48batteries that's that's definitely of
40:52interest and if it's still pretty early
40:54but there's good foundation for for the
40:57technology I think we'd be interested
40:59and the other thing is to realize that
41:02we've had two types of funding
41:03mechanisms we do a seed funding which is
41:05typically under a million and then we do
41:08a full on which funding which is
41:10anywhere between an outside 2 and 7
41:14million yeah so I mean in that case
41:18right a seed is normally something where
41:20there isn't a lot of data existing
41:22some ideas and we're really funding a
41:24proof of concept which looks a little
41:26bit more like you know the really more
41:29closer to fundamental research but
41:31obviously very much application-oriented
41:33the bigger projects were really looking
41:36for the you know the first real
41:38demonstration that what we thought could
41:41write with what you Scott you could
41:43accomplish with this technology is
41:45actually possible normally that's like a
41:46lab-scale demonstration and so you know
41:52either of those is ok right RPE kind of
41:54sits within the Department of Energy we
41:55have we have the office of science which
41:58is doing really fundamental science
41:59we've got you know the applied programs
42:02like eere which are really funding you
42:05know larger scale demonstrations etc we
42:09can play anywhere in between and I think
42:11Danes initial comment is probably the
42:12most important one which is as long as
42:15you can draw a connection between the
42:16research and development you're doing
42:18and a potential impact in one of our
42:21mission areas you're in good shape great
42:24I think Jane mentioned and during the
42:27presentation about how long we fund we
42:34typically fund something once and some
42:35we have a question here saying for truly
42:37innovative technologies that might meet
42:40or exceed our p's mission goals but will
42:43require a considerable amount of
42:45research to prove viability the basic
42:47concepts behind that technology is that
42:50something how would our ve think about
42:52something that was proposed the kind of
42:54is upfront acknowledging that there's a
42:56lot of research needed here to to get
42:58there even if the potential impact is is
43:01big and significant and it's in the
43:04mission area yeah I mean I think it's a
43:08good question i mean you know generally
43:11speaking I think we think about this a
43:12lot when we construct the programs right
43:14we're trying to put out a problem
43:16statement where we think that we can you
43:20know the proposals we get in will be
43:22such that we can fund you know great
43:24world-class teams for two to three years
43:27on the order of you know as most work
43:30you know we'll be putting in you know
43:31five six million dollars and you know
43:35we're going to try and construct
43:36problem statement such that we feel like
43:38by funding that we're going to actually
43:39move the needle in whether this is a
43:42feasible solution or not and move it
43:45towards impact and so normally you know
43:49that's the sweet spot right now I don't
43:51know if dan has any other thoughts on it
43:52yeah I mean I guess the way I look at it
43:54is it's our function as an agency is
43:57de-risking and so if the technology
44:01concept has a twenty percent chance of
44:04success and rpe could take it to an 80
44:07but there's still ninety percent of the
44:09work left in terms of funding we will
44:13have done our job our you know our job
44:15is not to fund the technology all the
44:18way to a product our job is to be risk
44:22it and show whether or not it's possible
44:24if we've done that successfully we have
44:28accomplished what are sort of our goal
44:30is so we you know we don't fund
44:33long-term what we'll do though is work
44:37with programs if they show a lot of
44:39potential and they can d risk some of
44:41the key scientific challenges work with
44:44some of the other agencies whether it's
44:46in DoD from of Defense or other agencies
44:49within department of energy to get them
44:51follow-on funding to take it to the next
44:53stage following up on the idea of
44:58incremental versus transformative one
45:00question was Elon referring to your
45:03example slides up at the beginning you
45:05know either the more you know fun
45:08examples of 10x you know coffee
45:11filtration you know kind of but there
45:13the person is asking you know that's
45:16great you know if this efficiently
45:18improvement is 10x that that's an
45:20example but what about how do we think
45:22about incremental versus transformative
45:24as the technology improves heat transfer
45:26efficiency by 3x is that incremental or
45:29transformative and maybe you could just
45:31kind of talk about how would we you know
45:34more define what we mean by
45:36transformational and if it is it just
45:39you know it's not the delorean you know
45:41there's gradations back from the
45:43delorean where we see
45:44transformational yeah i mean my answer
45:49would be pretty simple in the sense of
45:51you know we've got three mission areas
45:54we're looking for technologies where if
45:57they're successful they can move the
45:59needle significant advances in one of
46:02those and i use the example you know
46:04what we think in terms of quads here
46:05right so you know if you want to know
46:08kind of what's significant its quads or
46:11quads equivalent of whatever you're
46:13talking about you know the example that
46:16you gave adam of just heat transfer
46:18generally yeah i think raises the
46:20question of well what if it's a platform
46:23technology and the connection is not
46:24just okay for this specific application
46:27I threat I've developed a better or
46:29solar panel and so now we have better
46:31you know solar power generation you know
46:34heat transfer could have impacts across
46:36a lot of different applications and
46:38that's okay and those could be very big
46:41opportunities for impact normally when
46:44we set up a program description and
46:46solicitation will try and point out that
46:48different application areas that we
46:50think are relevant and and where the
46:52impact is going to come from but as an
46:54applicant you should you should draw
46:56that connection yourselves and as long
46:58as you feel like there's a credible
46:59story drawing the connection between
47:01your advanced and making those big
47:03impacts that's great I don't think
47:04there's any issue there and I'm just on
47:07to score for our listeners angle on that
47:09read the FOA no really a lot of effort
47:12goes into that and I think a lot of the
47:14questions that we receive during the
47:15live broadcast were about how can we
47:17understand what RV is looking for how
47:19can we understand you know what the goal
47:22is when the metrics are and NRP puts a
47:24lot of effort into crafting the funding
47:26opportunity announcements to give that
47:28guy that's very clearly yeah I mean Dana
47:30talked about all the different all the
47:32different internal reviews we go through
47:34for project selection and we also go
47:36through a bunch of rounds of reviews for
47:38what the program description looks like
47:40so a lot of thought has gone into every
47:42line in those program descriptions right
47:44do market projections play a role in
47:48either the development of foa's or in
47:51your review and evaluation of proposals
47:57ah yeah i bet that detective I think
48:02it's phrased in a tough way so my take
48:10on this you know is we we very
48:13consciously have decided that we want to
48:17make an impact we want there to be a
48:20credible path from the technology
48:22demonstration to some impact as an
48:25applicant we don't expect you to have
48:28knowledge about you know the
48:30nitty-gritty of a commercial space or
48:33commercial acumen and so we're going to
48:37take our knowledge base our thinking
48:39about the program look at your
48:40technology and and if we believe there's
48:44potential for that impact that's good
48:45enough I don't I don't think people
48:48should should feel as though they need
48:50to have some you know business plan in
48:53the back of their head when they propose
48:55they may have some no I agree with that
48:56and you know its technology first the
49:00impact obviously at a high level has to
49:02be there but you know we don't expect
49:06you know Marcus projections to be
49:09critical part of an application yeah I'm
49:12it may be an example there is you know
49:13we've got a program on you know we see
49:17our role is as kind of developing
49:18technology options right right and
49:21towards our mission areas right at RB we
49:25can't control things like policy things
49:26like markets so we want to keep we try
49:29and keep them in mind but they're
49:32they're not necessarily hard filters on
49:34what we're doing great I on the spirit
49:39of options one question comes SS in the
49:42most recent open fo I had over 50
49:45subtopics how do you manage deciding
49:48impact and one sub topic being more
49:50important than another you know and
49:52weighing through all of those and not
49:55you know just for everyone listening we
49:57can't comment specifically on open pro
49:59but just at a process level
50:01strategically how do you go about
50:03balancing choosing between the
50:08well I mean I write generally speaking
50:10it's not you know we're not comparing
50:12these proposals to one another in most
50:14cases right within specifically in our
50:17review process we're reviewing each
50:19proposal on the merits and thinking
50:21about you know how does that align with
50:24what we're looking for and so there
50:26might be 57 subgroups you know it's not
50:30like we need a fund that you know not
50:32Noah's Ark here we don't need to fund
50:33two in each subgroup and so right i mean
50:36i'd say you know I'd say it's pretty
50:40easy to distinguish because we're just
50:42looking at he once each one saying is
50:43this our PE or not is that yeah I agree
50:46I mean we look for impact you know
50:49certainly within the field but also more
50:52broadly and so yeah I would say it just
50:57depends on the quality of the proposal
51:00and the quality of the technical idea
51:02you know it could be if it really
51:04transformative in biofuels for example
51:07and advanced that field biofuels we
51:13recognize as being potentially impactful
51:15and RP mission areas would it be as big
51:19of an improvement as ten percent
51:24increase in solar panel efficiency it's
51:27hard to stay it's an emerging field so
51:29we generally just take the approaches as
51:32Ilan said of not picking sort of
51:36technological approaches but but
51:38creating technological options yeah I
51:41mean one thing to keep in mind is when
51:43you when you read our solicitations we
51:45normally have the review criteria that
51:47the reviewers are using and that we're
51:49using to assess project proposals and
51:52then there's something there that talks
51:54about basically you know program policy
51:56factors one of which often stubbe it
51:59usually ends up being sort of a balance
52:01of different approaches or different
52:03ideas and i think that the important
52:05point there is we do think about sort of
52:06balancing things in portfolios in the
52:09sense of you know right if we look at
52:14something in a very conventional area
52:16you know
52:17something that we know the the industry
52:20is already focused on we might look at
52:22those proposals slightly differently
52:24than if we have a proposal where we said
52:26wow we didn't even know that problem
52:28existed right and so you know this
52:30proposal out something about it that's
52:32really special and different and that
52:35might make it stand out or be unique
52:37okay well thank you both very much for
52:41today's presentation and I know we have
52:43a lot of other questions that we can't
52:45get to today but continue to tune in for
52:48future editions of our be University
52:50will continue to find ways to to bring
52:53you webinars on topics that can help you
52:55and your own work RVE has limited funds
52:57we do attempt to fund the best
52:59technologies but we know there are more
53:01ideas and there are dollars and so this
53:03is our effort here is to help give some
53:06support and encouragement to everyone
53:07but we can't give you money but we can
53:09hope to give you guidance and making
53:12your technology successful so that's all
53:14from RP until next time
