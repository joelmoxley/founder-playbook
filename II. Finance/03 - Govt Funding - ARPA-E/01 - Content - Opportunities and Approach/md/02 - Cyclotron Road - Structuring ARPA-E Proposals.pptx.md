Impact Opportunity and Need
* Impact opportunity aligned with ARPA-E mission
* Impact opportunity can be Quad scale
   * Ideally the direct impact can scale to quads, but otherwise you could argue for this scale of impact under certain plausible scenarios
   * Must draw some credible connection to large scale impact

Your novel tech approach to address impact opportunity
* Why this approach and not all the other competing approaches (consider both other classes of solutions as well as other approaches within this class)?
* How is it novel and distinct and why hasn’t it been tried already?
  * E.g. builds on a breakthroough, creatively brings ideas from another field, looks at the problem in a whole new way, leverages another technology learning curve that has hit an inflection, etc.
* If ARPA-E didn’t fund it, is it likely to be tried anyway by someone somewhere?

Tech & T2M targets that demonstrate impact potential
* Have you justified why these targets are what’s necessary to unleash this technology?
* Targets can be aligned with an entry application as a stepping stone to the final cost/performance needed for the impact application
* Targets must be quantitative and measurable
* T2M targets: what do you need to demonstrate outside the lab to validate that your technology will be impactful (see arpa-e tech to market website)

State of the art and gap analysis b/w current state and targets
* Where is your tech cost/performance now and how does that compare to the targets
* Each technology will have an array of performance categories and metrics – make sure you are comprehensive
   * E.g. efficiency, lifetime, density, cost, etc.
* Highlight and focus on the gaps that represent the highest risks and/or the most important performance metrics

Major technical risks that must be overcome to reach tech targets 
* Analyze the risks in terms of type, degree, etc.
* Come up with a system to rate and prioritize the risks
* Focus on technical risks, but consider non-technical risks as well
* Ultimately, you will want to show how your activities, targets, and team are aligned with your risks.

Activity streams that must be carried out
* Each activity stream should have an owner
* Activity streams should align with targets and risks
Berkeley Lab

Best possible team to carry out activities and address risks
* Align people/expertise with risks/activities
* Clarify which orgs/people are leading different activities and/or risks
* The project will formally have one lead PI (generally at the prime institution), but can be structured to functionally have multiple lead PIs based on function or topic
* Can you justify why the team members are uniquely qualified/positioned to address activities/risks?

Detailed plan with interim targets that show risk abatement
* Start with the final targets / milestones aligned with the various activity streams / risks
* Add in the high-level go/no-go interim targets / milestones
  * generally with no more than one go/no-go per activity stream per year
* Project plan generally plotted out at quarterly intervals
* Have a lead owner for each activity/milestone

Budget that credibly allows you to perform work within project timeline
* Start by building a bottom-up budget based on what it will cost to do what you want
* If that number is between $1M and $6M, you are probably ok; otherwise, you’ll need to rethink the plan
* $1-2M considered early-stage, $3-4M is standard, $5-6M is getting to a big project (rare for academic)
* Think about how much money is going to each team
  * Practical and political aspects
* Bear in mind arpa-e may cut budget/activities
