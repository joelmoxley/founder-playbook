ARPA-E Program Framing Questions  
What is the problem to be solved?   
What is the current state of R&D? How is the proposed program a transformative and disruptive approach?  
What are the program goals and how will progress towards those goals be measured?  
What  research communities need to be brought together?   
How does the program complement R&D efforts in other DOE programs, federal agencies, and the private sector?    
Why is now the  right time to solve this problem?   
What happens at the conclusion of the program? What are the barriers to commercialization and how might these problems be overcome?    
If successful, how will the proposed program impact one or more of ARPA-E’s mission areas?   
Adapted from the DARPA Heilmeier questions 


If it works…   
will it matter?

Creating a Successful ARPA-E Project  
The ability to make an  IMPACT  
The potential to  TRANSFORM  our energy future  
A  BRIDGE  from science to breakthrough technology    
A  TEAM  of best-in-class experts 


Top 5 Tips for Writing a Competitive Proposal  
1. Read the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)  
2. Demonstrate impact  
3. Describe the technology  
4. Compare to state of art  
5. Identify challenges and solutions  


Top 5 Tips for Writing a Competitive Proposal  
1. Read the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)  
  * Motivation for the program  
  * Program objectives  
  * Technical categories of interest  
  * Technical performance targets  
2. Demonstrate impact  
3. Describe technology  
4. Compare to state of art  
5. Identify challenges and solutions  
Read the FOA!   
Then read it again,  carefully . 


Top 5 Tips for Writing a Competitive Proposal  
Read the Funding Opportunity  
Announcement (FOA)  
1. Read the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)  
2. Demonstrate impact  
  * How does it impact ARPA-E mission areas?  
  * What problem are you trying to solve?  
  Reduce Imports
  Improve Efficiency
  Reduce Emissions
Your first question should not be “will it work?”  
“If it works, will it matter?” 
3. Describe the technology  
4. Compare to state of art  
5. Identify challenges and solutions  


Dos and  Don’ts of Demonstrating Impact  
Hydrogen-based super biodegradable diapers 
* Exposing diaper to UV light activates ability to fully dissolve in water in 30 s vs. 300 y biodegradation of conventional diapers  
* Will save ~18 billion diapers a year from entering US landfills  
Does not address an ARPA-E mission  
Carbon-reducing biocatalyst for human waste  
* Novel carbon reducing bio-catalyst reduces human wasteto pure carbon and water (CH2)n  + n/2O  = nC(s) + nH2O
* Technology acts as carbon sink using human waste, potentially reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1 Giga-tonne per year  
Addresses an ARPA-E mission area 


Top 5 Tips for Writing a Competitive Proposal  

1. Read the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)  
2. Demonstrate impact  
3. Describe the technology 
  * How does it work? Describe with absolutely no jargon.  
  * What’s new in your approach?   
  * Why do you think it will be successful? 
4. Compare to state of art  
5. Identify challenges and solutions  


Dos and Don’ts of Describing Technology  
Too vague, no content
* 10x more efficient time travel to any date and place in the history of the universe  
* Leverages novel proprietary technology from Doc and McFly Industries, Inc.  
* Validated at proof-of-concept scale by D&M Industry advisors, including several Nobel laureates   
Flexible, energy efficient time travel
* Next generation flux capacitor based on proprietary hafnium alloy is the key enabling technology  
* Capacitor placement within metallic vehicle body perturbs the flux dispersal field, allowing smooth passage through the space-time continuum (see references 3-8)  
* Time travel requires 1.21 Gigawatt-hours of electrical power, with allows for 10x efficiency gain as validated via the mass/energy balance outlined in Table 3  
Backs up claims, gives specifics

Why should we fund you?  
Provide  key insight/unique approach  to solve a problem where others failed 


Final Remark on Pedigrees
* It doesn’t matter  who  you are…
  * Nobel prize winner or  
  * Founder of a tiny startup company 
* We only care about the  quality of the idea  
If you’re really good, let it show through in the  quality of your proposal.
