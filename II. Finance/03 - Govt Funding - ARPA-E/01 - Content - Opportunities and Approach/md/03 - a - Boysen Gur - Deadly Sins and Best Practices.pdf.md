5 Deadly Sins 


5 Deadly Sins of an ARPA-E proposal  
Thou shall not submit a proposal that is…  
1. Insignificant   
2. Indistinguishable  
3. Incremental  
4. Incoherent  
5. Indefinite 


5 Deadly Sins of an ARPA-E proposal  
Insignificant:  The proposal does not draw a clear connection showing that a successful project would lead to significant impact on on of ARPA-E's mission areas 


5 Deadly Sins of an ARPA-E proposal  
* Insignificant:  The proposal does not draw a clear connection showing that a successful project would lead to  significant impact  on on of ARPA-E's mission areas  
Our advanced block copolymer membrane technology will dramatically improve energy efficiency of coffee filtering:  
 * 10X more energy efficient than state-of-the-art coffee filtration  
 * Impact over 100 million coffee drinkers in US 


5 Deadly Sins of an ARPA-E proposal  
* Insignificant:  The proposal does not draw a clear connection showing that a successful project would lead to significant impact  on one of ARPA-E's mission areas  
Our novel hydrogel technology will allow for a new generation of super biodegradable diapers: 
* Exposing diaper to uv light activates ability to fully dissolve in water in 30 seconds, vs. the 300 year biodegradation time scale of conventional diapers  
* Will save ~18 billion diapers from entering US landfills each year 


5 Deadly Sins of an ARPA-E proposal  
* Indistinguishable:  The proposal fails to communicate how the proposed approach is innovative and differentiated from commercial or emerging technologies being funded or developed elsewhere. 


5 Deadly Sins of an ARPA-E proposal  
* Incremental:  The proposal describes a low-risk approach that seems more like an engineering development project vs. disruptive R&D 


5 Deadly Sins of an ARPA-E proposal  
* Incoherent:  The proposal reads as though several disparate sections by different team partners were written independently and \"stapled" together -- lacks cohesive vision/teaming 


5 Deadly Sin\" of an ARPA-E proposal  
* Indefinite:  The proposal generically describes ideas being proposed without any detail on the technology, and/or provides no justifications for the claims that are made.  
Next generation vehicle allows for flexible, energy efficient time travel
* Allows for 10X more efficient time travel to any date and place in the history of the universe  
* Technology leverages novel proprietary technology from Doc and McFly Industries, Inc.  
* Technology has been validated at proof-of-concept scale by D&M Industry advisors, including several nobel laureates 


5 Deadly Sin\" of an ARPA-E proposal  
* Indefinite:  The proposal generically describes ideas being proposed without any detail on the technology, and/or provides no justifications for the claims that are made.  
Next generation vehicle allows for flexible, energy efficient time travel  
* Allows for 10X more efficient time travel to any date and place in the history of the universe  
* Next generation flux capacitor based on proprietary hafnium alloy is the key enabling technology  
* Capacitor placement within metallic vehicle body perturbs the flux dispersal field, allowing smooth passage through the space-time continuum (see references 3-8)   
* Time travel requires 1.21 Jigawatt-hours of electrical power, with allows for 10x efficiency gain as validated via the mass/energy balance outlined in Table 3 


5 Deadly Sins of an ARPA-E proposal  
1. Insignificant:  The proposal does not draw a clear connection showing that a successful project would lead to significant impact on on of ARPA-E's mission areas  
2. Indistinguishable:  The proposal fails to communicate how the proposed approach is innovative and differentiated from commercial or emerging technologies being funded or developed elsewhere.

Literature Example  
Rechargeable Solid State Fluorine Ion Battery   
We propose a rechargeable fluorine ion (F-ion) battery that uses a solid state fluorine ion conductor (e.g. La Ba F ) with metal fluoride electrodes, such as the Ce//CuF2  couple.  Solid state F-ion batteries with electrodes such as Ce//CuF2 electrodes have a theoretical energy density of 792 Wh/kg (2.9 V) that compares favorably to state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries such as LiC6 //CoO2  at 568 Wh/kg (3.6 V). To date, we have demonstrated that the Ce//BiF3 electrode couple is rechargeable (Figure 2).  Several key challenges remain in demonstrating the viability of a F-ion battery including: 1) decreasing electrolyte resistance losses, 2) increasing electrode material utilizations, and 3) maintaining capacity over long cycle life. In the proposed work these challenges will be addressed by 1) decreasing the electrolyte thickness and doping the electrolyte to increase conductivity, 2) engineering electrode microstructure to better utilize electrode material; and 3) selecting optimal electrode materials for enhanced cyclability.

The Heilmeier Catechism  
George H. Heilmeier  
DARPA Director (1975-1977)  
* What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives with absolutely no jargon.  
* How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?  
* What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?  
* Who cares?  
* If you’re successful, what difference will it make?  
* How much will it cost?  
* How long will it take?  
* What are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success?
