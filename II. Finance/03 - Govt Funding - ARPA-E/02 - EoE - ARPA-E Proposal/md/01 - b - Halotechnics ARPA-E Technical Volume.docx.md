Abstract (1 page): Halotechnics proposes to develop a thermal storage system utilizing a low melting point molten glass as the heat transfer and thermal storage material. An advanced oxide glass promises a potential breakthrough in a low cost, earth abundant, and stable thermal storage material. This novel material will enable unprecedented efficiency with thermal energy storage exploiting sensible heat. We will develop a two-tank thermal storage system operating at a high temperature of 1200 °C and a low temperature of 400 °C. This project will leverage technology used in the modern glass industry, with decades of experience in handling high temperature viscous materials. Halotechnics will integrate its proven expertise in combinatorial chemistry with advanced techniques for handling molten glass. The molten glass thermal storage system has the potential to reduce thermal storage costs by a factor of ten once developed and deployed at commercial scale. Thermal storage at the target temperature can be integrated with existing high temperature gas turbines that significantly increase efficiencies over today’s steam turbine technology.
We will take a systematic approach to eliminating risk from critical components of the molten glass thermal storage system. The proposed project scope includes both the development and optimization of a novel molten glass for heat transfer and thermal storage, as well as the system to pump, heat, and store the novel material. The first aspect of this program is to develop an advanced glass with sufficiently low melting point, low viscosity, and low cost to achieve the performance targets of the program. We have identified a promising proof of concept material and measured its physical properties in our laboratory. Halotechnics is a proven leader in combinatorial chemistry and materials science and we will leverage our expertise to optimize the material for heat transfer and thermal energy storage at large scales. The second aspect of this program is to develop a prototype system to pump, heat, store, and discharge the molten glass fluid. Halotechnics staff has deep experience in thermal system design and high temperature engineering. We will leverage existing techniques borrowed from the glass industry to efficiently and reliably transfer and store heat in our prototype system. Halotechnics has formed a project team with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, a proven leader in engineering for severe environments.
If successful this project will be both transformative and disruptive. We propose to translate technology developed by the glass industry and use it to transform a new sector – to develop cheap thermal energy storage for concentrating solar power (CSP). Once deployed, our technology will provide thermal energy storage at such a low cost that it will make today’s technology obsolete. Our proposed solution reduces the cost of CSP and thermal energy storage by two routes: 1) enabling significantly higher operating temperatures in the plants and more effective sensible heat thermal storage, and 2) enabling the use of a lower cost thermal storage material. 
The SunShot Initiative sets the goal of making solar electricity cheaper than fossil fuels by 2020. To achieve this vision we must push for a breakthrough in low cost thermal energy storage. We must push for significantly higher operating temperature in CSP plants in order to use more efficient power conversion technology. Halotechnics has identified a pathway to enable this vision via advanced molten glass.

RD&D Strategy (20 pages)
Innovation: Current commercially deployed thermal storage systems are two-tank sensible heat designs using molten salt as the thermal storage media [1].This technology has been deployed in many commercial CSP plants in Spain and others under construction in the U.S. The most significant drawback of this technology is its high capital cost – up to $120/kWht [2].This high cost represents a significant impediment for project developers seeking to finance and build plants with thermal storage. The high cost is due primarily to the inefficient use of the most expensive component of the system – the thermal storage media – which typically makes up 50-60% of the total cost of the storage system [3]. With sensible heat systems, the amount of thermal energy stored is directly proportional to the temperature difference of the storage material. Today’s plants using this technology have a small temperature difference between the hot tank (at 400 °C) and the cold tank (at 300 °C). Our innovation will increase by a factor of eight the temperature difference in the storage system, resulting in equal heat being stored with 1/8th the material relative to the state of the art technology. Furthermore, our advanced molten glass material could be 50% cheaper than the molten salt used for today’s technology. Based upon our estimates including the higher cost of high temperature structural materials, we anticipate a potential 10X reduction in the cost per unit energy stored with our proposed innovation – as low as $12/kWht once deployed at commercial scale.
The higher operating temperature enabled by the success of our innovation will dramatically increase the efficiency of the power block available to CSP project developers. Today’s steam turbines used for commercial CSP plants achieve a gross conversion efficiency of approximately 38% [4], constrained primarily by their lower operating temperature (under 400 °C). A combined cycle gas turbine with an inlet temperature of 1200 °C can achieve a conversion efficiency  of 52%. The outlet temperature of the gas from the compressor of such a turbine is just under 400 °C, setting the temperature of the cold tank in our system. We will develop an optimized glass material and thermal storage system with operating temperatures tailored to commercially available gas turbines. 
It is imperative that we reduce our usage of fossil fuels to address pressing societal concerns – climate change and environmental degradation, energy security and price volatility. If successful, our innovation would both reduce the cost of CSP and enable economic thermal storage, bringing the nation significantly closer to eliminating the use of coal and furthering ARPA-E’s Mission Areas. This will result in enhanced energy security for the United States – by enabling clean reliable solar electricity day and night. 
Approach: Halotechnics has formed a project team with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, a world leading engineering firm with experience in aerospace and power generation. We propose to design and build a complete system prototype of an advanced sensible heat thermal storage system, shown in Figure 1. In place of a central receiver we will use a standard laboratory tube furnace to heat the molten glass as it flows through the pipes. Rocketdyne will select the piping material and joining techniques for containing the advanced molten glass at 1200 °C.

We have identified five critical components that must be developed and validated in order for our thermal storage system to be successful. Our strategy is to leverage the knowledge of an expert with world-class experience in each of these critical areas and utilize their skills as a consultant, employee, or project partner to accelerate the development of their respective subsystem. In this manner we will minimize the time necessary to quickly internalize previous work for each component and go beyond the current state of the art into advanced designs. We will take a two-step approach to developing the critical pump and heat exchanger components: 1) build a proof of concept alpha prototype that operates with a proxy fluid at ambient conditions, and 2) build a full temperature beta prototype operating with molten glass and building off the results of the alpha prototype. 
Critical Component 1: Heat transfer and thermal storage fluid
Expertise from Leo Finkelstein, low melting glass scientist
At the heart of our design is a pumpable molten glass – dirt cheap and stable. Glass is most commonly a mixture of oxides, the most abundant materials in the earth’s crust. Oxides are typically what one digs out of a mine – raw ore. A common glass such as Pyrex is a material made up of silicon dioxide, boron oxide, and sodium oxide. Oxide glasses have many compelling characteristics:
Very high thermal stability. As typical end products of thermal decomposition in air, metal oxides are stable against further decomposition up to very high temperatures, far beyond molten salt. Oxides typically have very low vapor pressure at high temperatures.
Very low cost. Production of oxide ores occurs worldwide, in quantities of millions of tons annually. Purified silicon dioxide, for example, sells for as low as $80 per ton.
Low environmental impact. Oxides are typically not water soluble and therefore represent a low risk of entering the water table in the event of a spill. They are very stable and typically do not react violently with other chemicals.  
We have identified a promising proof of concept oxide mixture that is suitable for further development into an advanced heat transfer and thermal energy storage material. It is a composition of sodium oxide, phosphorous pentoxide, and molybdenum trioxide (Na2O-P2O5-MoO3), called the “moly glass.” We have performed sufficient analysis on the moly glass to verify that as a proof of concept material, it appears suitable for heat transfer and thermal storage applications from 400 °C up to 1200 °C. We will use it as a starting point from which to begin our high throughput combinatorial chemistry work and optimize its properties.
Critical Component 2: Piping material
Expertise from Pratt & Whitney ¬Rocketdyne, leading aerospace engineering firm
Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne will leverage its expertise with engineering materials selection for severe environments to address the critical issue of material selection for the molten glass piping. Molten glass is corrosive to pure iron, nickel, and cobalt, especially at high temperatures [5]. Furthermore, the creep resistance of common alloys is not sufficient for applications at 1200 °C. To solve this problem we will select from commercially available refractory alloys that are available in common tube and sheet sizes. Alloys of nickel, cobalt, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, and other metals are commercially available in sheets, tubes, and other forms. Piping of this design will have a higher per foot cost than stainless steel alloys when scaled up for commercial applications. This additional cost for molten glass service will be offset by the higher overall efficiency enabled by the high temperature operation of our system and the low cost of the glass material. 
Critical Component 3: Tank design 
Expertise from RHI Monofrax, leading supplier of refractory ceramics
We propose to modify a commercially proven internally insulated tank design for storing molten glass at high temperature. Glass melting furnaces, operating for extended periods up to 1600 °C, are constructed of a refractory ceramic material known as “Monofrax.” This material contains zirconium oxide, fusion cast in graphite molds. It costs as low as $9/kg when purchased in bulk. Our concept for the hot tank is an internally insulated design using Monofrax in direct contact with the molten glass and surrounded by a low-cost insulation material. The exterior of the tank can be constructed of a steel alloy since it will be thermally isolated from the hot interior. We have had discussions with the staff of the leading U.S. supplier of refractories, RHI Monofrax in Falconer, New York. RHI is capable of custom designing the shape and composition of its Monofrax material. Halotechnics will work with RHI to procure the necessary materials for the construction of the hot thermal storage tank.
Critical Component 4: Molten glass pump
Expertise from Dr. Michael Tenhover, glass technology expert
The high viscosity of glass can be used to the designer’s advantage with a device called a “viscosity pump.” [6] This device uses a roller clad with a thin layer of refractory alloy that sits partially immersed in a pool of molten glass. As the roller spins the high viscosity of the glass causes it to be dragged along in the direction of rotation. The glass is skimmed off the roller by a wiper and directed into a passageway. In this manner a high pressure flow can be generated with a simple, elegant design that minimizes the use of expensive materials. We will design a small viscosity pump and demonstrate its functionality for both the hot tank and cold tank in our prototype system. 
Critical Component 5: Heat exchanger
Expertise from Dr. Adam Bruckner, one of the original inventors of the liquid droplet heat exchanger
We propose to develop an internally insulated liquid droplet heat exchanger [7]. This type of device is used at large scale in the chemical industry and once validated with our prototype could be scaled up to commercial size for CSP applications. The direct contact design facilitates an extremely high heat transfer coefficient between the molten glass and the working fluid, and allows a compact design that minimizes the use of expensive construction materials. The design we propose is a vertical column of Monofrax bricks with an internal passage for the glass/air cross flow. Glass flows down in droplets produced from a nozzle, air flows up. The Monofrax is surrounded by low cost ceramic insulation, which is in turn enclosed by a steel column. In this manner the steel housing provides rupture strength but is insulated from the high temperature inside the column.
Technical Work Plan: The following tasks describe the step by step process we will follow in order to develop the critical components described above.
Task 1: Glass screening workflow development
Halotechnics has developed world class experimental techniques, software tools, and data handling capabilities for combinatorial chemistry R&D. We have successfully used our techniques for a variety of applications in developing patent-pending heat transfer fluids [8]. Figure 2 shows the high throughput workflow we will utilize for rapidly screening thousands of candidate glasses for desirable properties and narrow the candidates down to one optimal material. Each stage is labeled with the approximate number of experiments to be performed. The workflow acts as a sieve and screens a large number of candidate materials, eliminating the majority at each stage and reducing the number of experiments necessary at the subsequent stage.

Figure 2: Screening workflow for advanced molten glass.
Formulation: The glass mixtures will be dispensed in powder form with the automated powder dispensing robot at Halotechnics (MTM Powdernium, Symyx Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Glass mixtures will be dispensed onto a plate with 50 separate wells. The mixtures will be melted and homogenized in a furnace at 1200 °C for 12 hours. Once cooled a 20 mg sample of each mixture will be harvested and loaded onto an aluminum pan for melting point testing. Throughput: 50+ samples per day.
Melting point: Halotechnics will purchase a high performance differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) to function as the primary screening device (Discovery DSC, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). With autosampling capability the DSC has the ability to screen 50 samples per day. In this manner we will rapidly measure the melting point of up to 2500 unique mixtures in search of optimal properties.
Heat capacity: The heat capacity is a critical property for a thermal storage material; a higher heat capacity means less material is needed to store a given amount of thermal energy. We will use the DSC to accurately measure the heat capacity of the hits resulting from primary screening. Each heat capacity test takes several hours and so must be done on a smaller number of samples in order to maintain high throughput. Throughput: 2-3 samples per day.
Viscosity: A low viscosity is desired to reduce parasitic pumping losses in the CSP plant. Halotechnics will purchase a molten glass viscometer capable of measuring a wide range of viscosity up to 1600 °C (RSV-1600, Orton Instruments, Westerville, OH). The device uses a spindle immersed in the glass melt which is contained in a platinum crucible. Throughput: 1-2 samples per day 
Corrosion: Quantifying the corrosion behavior of the glass with common structural alloys is critical to understand for long term operation of CSP plants. Halotechnics has developed a device for measuring long term corrosion behavior with a variety of stainless steels or other alloys.
Equipment necessary to complete the high throughput workflow will be procured and set up at Halotechnics facilities. The methods necessary for sample preparation and accurate data acquisition will be developed. Experimental protocols will be developed to ensure consistent and reliable data handling.
Key risks and recovery plan: There is a risk that the methods necessary to properly synthesize the glass materials reduce the throughput of the workflow. For example, laborious mechanical mixing may be necessary after powder dispensing in order to later achieve a homogeneous glass melt. We will leverage the knowledge of the expert team at Halotechnics and their successful experience with similar materials in order to maximize the chance of success with method development.
Task 2: Optimize glass material
The workflow developed in Task 1 will subsequently be used to optimize the advanced glass heat transfer and thermal storage material. Halotechnics will begin this process with the moly glass previously identified and subsequently reduce its cost and viscosity. See Figure 3 for a phase diagram containing the moly glass mixture. We have synthesized this material in our laboratory using commonly available chemicals. We have measured its melting at 349 °C, very close to the literature value. The moly glass is stable to at least 1200 °C. We have heated it to this temperature and held it for over one hour, then re-measured its thermal properties after the test. The melting point results and the weight of the sample were unchanged within experimental error. The moly glass forms a clear reddish brown melt and at 700 °C has a viscosity near water based upon qualitative observations. See Figure 4 for data from melting point and stability testing of this material.
We have performed sufficient analysis on the moly glass to verify that as a proof of concept material, it appears suitable for heat transfer and thermal storage applications from 400 °C up to 1200 °C. However in its current form it is too expensive (molybdenum oxide is the most expensive component at over $30/kg) and is too viscous at low temperature (at 400 °C it has a higher viscosity than honey, based upon qualitative observations). The optimal combination of these properties with an acceptable melting point will be a primary focus of our work. Large changes in glass physical properties (hundreds of degrees in melting point, orders of magnitude in viscosity) can be induced by adding or removing components from a glass melt. Reducing the amount of molybdenum will significantly lower the cost. We will develop models for physical properties and materials cost to complement experimental work in our R&D program.

Figure 4: Moly glass testing (a) DSC with melting point, (b) TGA data showing stable behavior. Inset shows view inside furnace heating moly glass at 1200 °C.
Target: Low cost, low melting point, low viscosity: We will select from a variety of earth abundant components to lower the moly glass melting point and viscosity. These candidate components include alkali, alkaline earth, and transition metal oxides, such as silicon dioxide, iron oxide, manganese oxide, vanadium oxide, and many others. We will also consider additional non-oxide components, such as fluorides, chlorides, nitrides, or sulfides, which may have desirable effects on the physical properties of the fluid. We will target a melting point of 350 °C or below in order to achieve our desired cold tank temperature of 400 °C.
Figure 5: E490 phase diagram [9].
Our technique to develop advanced low melting point materials involves selecting a simple two component baseline mixture and adding a third component to that baseline mixture, measuring the resulting properties, and searching the phase space until the ternary eutectic is found. We will continue this search with all feasible earth abundant components in three component mixtures. Then we will select the most promising components and begin the same process with four component (quaternary) mixtures to develop high order eutectics.
To begin the screening process we have eliminated the expensive molybdenum trioxide from our proof of concept glass mixture and selected a two component eutectic mixture consisting of sodium oxide and phosphorous pentoxide. This mixture, called E490, has a eutectic melting point at 490 °C as shown in Figure 5. 
We have performed a preliminary literature review and have identified a list of earth abundant oxides that reduce the melting point when added to the E490 baseline. For example, the addition of calcium oxide reduces the melting point by approximately 80 °C [9]. Other oxides have a similar effect: magnesium oxide, boron oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, potassium oxide, and others. We will first perform a complete literature review to assess the current knowledge with two or three component mixtures of the oxides of interest. Then we will systematically screen the melting point of ternary mixtures based on E490 with one additional component. The most promising components that had the biggest melting point reduction from 490 °C will then be combined to explore the quaternary phase space based upon E490. In this manner we have the ability to explore high order mixtures, including five components (quinary) and more. See Table 1 for the materials palette we will draw from as candidate glass mixture components. The materials are listed in approximate order of earth abundance. We are confident that we can eliminate the molybdenum in our advanced glass and replace it with two or three different oxides to maintain the melting point near 350 °C at a much lower cost.
Based upon our preliminary experimental work, some components increase the glass viscosity when used in higher proportions in the melt; others dramatically lower it [10]. We will use glass components that act as network modifiers, weakening the interactions between glass molecules (often referred to as inducing ‘fragility’ in the network) and thereby reducing viscosity [11]. For example, sodium oxide dramatically lowers the viscosity at a given temperature when added to a glass melt. Other alkali and alkaline earth oxides have a similar effect [12]. Silica on the other hand, greatly increases the viscosity of the melt; eliminating it entirely dramatically reduces the viscosity. We have identified a list of glass components that tend to lower the viscosity when used in larger proportions in silica melts. We will use these materials as possible candidates with which to formulate our glass. Halotechnics’ superior capability in combinatorial materials synthesis will enable fast screening of the glass compositions with different modifiers to minimize and achieve optimum glass viscosity at 400 °C.

We will use the molten glass viscometer to measure the viscosity of approximately 25 hits resulting from the melting point and heat capacity screening process. We will measure the viscosity as a function of temperature across the full operating range of the fluid – from the melting point up to 1200 °C. In this manner we will develop a fundamental understanding of how the viscosity changes as a function of glass composition. We are targeting a maximum viscosity below 1000 cP for easy pumping and low parasitic losses. At this viscosity the ratio of delivered thermal power from the flowing glass to the mechanical power required to pump the glass is high. This translates to low parasitic losses from pumping the molten glass out of the cold tank, up the tower and through the receiver tubes, and into the hot storage tank. Assuming typical pipe geometries, a 500 MWt receiver would require less than 5 MW of pumping power, or less than 1% parasitic loads. Pumping the glass out of the hot tank and through the heat exchanger will require much less power due to the low viscosity of the hot glass.
Phase 1 work will focus on developing an optimized glass formulation for subsequent system testing in Phase 2. In parallel to system testing, work will continue to develop alternative formulations for the glass to further improve the physical properties, logistics, or manufacturing techniques. These alternative formulations will improve the robustness of the heat transfer fluid to changing market conditions. For example, it may be possible to achieve the same target properties for the molten glass by using different earth abundant components than those first utilized in Phase 1. It is important to assess different routes for achieving the same goal in order to develop a robust heat transfer fluid. Supply chain disruptions, price volatility, or some other events may necessitate the use of alternative formulations.
Sufficient quantity of the optimized glass material will be synthesized and produced in powder form for easy melting in subsequent component tests. Halotechnics will work with a toll manufacturer capable of producing small batches of specialty glass and then grinding it into a uniform powder.
Key risks and recovery plan: There is a risk that no glass materials tested in Phase 1 will conform to the project objectives. For example, there may be a family of oxide mixtures with low melting points but high viscosity. The risk from this possibility is likely low since we have obtained preliminary data showing candidate glass materials with favorable properties. This risk will be reduced by the throughput and flexibility of the workflow. If a system of oxides is not generating candidates that meet the criteria, the search may be expanded to include more components or oxides of a different variety. 
There is a risk that the workflow will not achieve the throughput or sufficient weeks in operation to successfully screen the total number of desired formulations. This risk will be addressed during the discovery program by using a flexible design of experiments methodology. If during the discovery program the total number of experiments is not on track to meet the initial target, subsequent library designs will be adjusted appropriately.  It is possible that the available design space may be sufficiently explored with a number of experiments smaller than the initially proposed target.
Task 3: Piping material selection
Several types of alloys are commercially available candidates for containing molten glass at 1200 °C. Rocketdyne will develop a matrix with candidate alloys, the relevant properties of each such as creep strength and density, joining techniques, and cost. Advanced coating techniques will be considered to improve oxidation resistance. Based upon a preliminary review, possible candidate materials include alloys of molybdenum (TZM), cobalt (Haynes 188), or nickel (Haynes 230).
Molybdenum has exceptional creep resistance at elevated temperatures. TZM, an alloy of Mo with small amounts of Ti and Zr, has improved mechanical properties versus the pure alloy and is easier to fabricate. However, molybdenum alloys must be protected from oxygen to prevent severe oxidation and spalling. To solve this we will passivate the moly with a commercially available siliciding process. This technique results in a thin layer of silica on the surface of the molybdenum which prevents oxidation. Welding molybdenum alloys is difficult and they are quite expensive.
We will consider cobalt and nickel alloys as alternative to molybdenum. Cobalt alloys have strength approaching molybdenum at high temperatures, with improved weldability and cost. Haynes 188 for example exhibits excellent strength and oxidation resistance for applications approaching 1100 °C. Nickel alloys are commonly used in gas turbine and other high temperature applications where long life is desired. Haynes 230 for example is rated for applications approaching 1150 °C. Alternative coating techniques are possible with these alloys. Depending on required creep resistance conditions, aluminum diffusion-coated alloys could work and can be prepared by a number of commercial coating outfits. This coating forms an alumina layer for protection and has good oxidation resistance. 
Key risks and recovery plan: There is a risk that no commercially available alloys can meet the requirements of the proposed application due to insufficient strength or oxidation resistance at high temperature. We will consider alternatives such as ceramic and ceramic composite materials for the piping application; such materials are used at temperatures exceeding 1600 °C. 
Task 4: Corrosion testing
Figure 6: Multichannel Corrosion Analysis Tool for testing alloy and glass compatibility at 1200 °C.
Corrosion testing of candidate structural alloys and refractory ceramics will be crucial in order to assess long term materials compatibility with molten glass at elevated temperatures. Silica is the primary component of most commercially relevant glass materials and is the cheapest material, but also the most corrosive. Other oxide components have varying degrees of corrosion behavior. Halotechnics has developed a four channel device called the Multichannel Corrosion Analysis Tool (MCAT) for testing molten salt corrosion up to 700 °C. A modified version of this device will be developed capable of extended operation at 1200 °C (see Figure 6). It will consist of four independently controlled crucible furnaces, with several kilograms of molten glass held in a refractory crucible. Metal coupons of alloys of interest will be immersed in the molten glass and held at 1200 °C for extended durations (up to 3000 hours). Thermal cycling between 1200 °C and 400 °C to mimic the daily operation in a CSP plant will also be used as a test condition. Coupons will be periodically removed from the glass and subsequently analyzed for mass changes and cross sectional metallography. Samples of Monofrax will also be submerged in the glass and subsequently analyzed for mass loss and corrosion rates. The measured corrosion rate will allow us to design the hot glass storage tank with sufficient Monofrax lining to provide for a 20+ year plant lifetime. 
Due to the limited throughput of this method, this work will be performed on only a few glass materials resulting from primary and secondary screening late in Phase 1 and extending into the first half of Phase 2.
Key risks and recovery plan: Corrosion may be unacceptably high with all feasible alloys. Modifying the composition of the glass will significantly affect corrosion; this option will be used in order to develop a low-corrosion glass that is compatible with our chosen alloys. As a fallback plan it may be possible to form Monofrax into hollow cylinders and join them together to function as a pipe. 
Task 5: Tank modeling
The hot tank operating at 1200 °C is a critical component of the prototype system. See Figure 7 for a cross sectional diagram of our proposed design as well as an image of the Monofrax material.

Figure 8: Temperature proceeding radially outward from center of tank.
The first step in the completion of the hot tank design task is to develop a complete thermal-mechanical-economic model of the tank so its design can be optimized. The optimal design will involve calculating the minimum installed cost of the tank at an acceptable level of thermal losses. The SolidWorks 3D solid modeling software package will be used to design parts and make mechanical drawings for manufacturing. SolidWorks will also be used to simulate mechanical loading and thermal performance of an assembly of parts. The results of thermal and mechanical simulation will be complemented by our supply chain analysis of the cost of materials and estimates of labor rates for tank construction at commercial scale. 
Thermal issues: The thickness of the internal and external insulation affects the temperature of the steel housing and therefore will drive the materials selection of the tank. The optimal design is a balance of many tradeoffs [13]. Increasing the thickness of the external insulation decreases thermal losses (increasing charge/discharge efficiency) but also increases the temperature of the steel structure which may necessitate more expensive alloys. Similarly, increasing the thickness of the internal insulation reduces the temperature of the steel housing but requires more ceramic material and more labor expense to construct the complete tank. See Figure 8 for a schematic of the temperature of the tank materials proceeding radially outward from the molten glass interior. The tank will be designed such that the temperature just inside of the steel shell is below the freezing point of the molten glass. In the event of a leak, as the glass permeates to this location it will freeze and form a self-sealing barrier.
Mechanical issues: The internal insulation must be able to transmit the hydrostatic pressure of the molten glass inventory directly to the steel structure. The rupture strength of the ceramic is a critical property and must be understood in order to produce a reliable design. At the same time the diameter and height of the tank affect the thickness required for the steel housing in order to keep stresses at an acceptable level. The tank interface to the molten glass pump must also be designed.
Economic issues: Materials and labor costs are key drivers in the tank economic performance. By using the internally insulated concept we project significant savings by eliminating the need for expensive nickel alloys in the tank construction since stainless steel costs approximately 1/8th as much per pound. Additional savings may be possible by using carbon steel (less than one half the cost per pound relative to stainless steel) for the tank housing, by increasing the internal insulation thickness and reducing the shell temperature to acceptable levels. However this must be balanced by the increased labor cost from installing thick ceramic bricks inside the tank. 
Our innovation will achieve a high exergetic efficiency when charged and discharged. The thermal storage tanks at Andasol lose approximately 1 °C per day when full [1]. For our prototype we estimate 10 °C lost per day in the hot tank due to the higher storage temperature and smaller volume and 3 °C per day in the cold tank. This results in a round trip exergetic efficiency of 98% after storing heat for 12 hours. The expression for exergetic efficiency, assuming an incompressible fluid with an average specific heat simplifies to:

where Tdo and Tdi are the temperature of the fluid during discharging (out and into the storage system), Tco and Tci are the temperature of the fluid during charging (out and into the storage system), and Tamb is the ambient temperature. Inserting the temperature targets for the hot and cold tank during charge and discharge results in a round trip exergetic efficiency η of 98%. This calculation neglects the parasitic pumping loads from the molten glass pumps. This load is expected to be small relative to the power output of the plant due to the high density of molten glass and the relatively short length of required piping in the proposed two-tank thermal storage system. The hot tank and cold tanks will be used as molten glass reservoirs for subsequent component testing. 
Task 6: Tank design and testing
Hot tank: We will select materials for the internal insulation, tank housing, external insulation, and external skin of the hot tank. We will design the tank with internal immersion or radiative heaters to maintain the glass at high temperature for initial filling or other testing purposes. These heaters will be turned off during full system testing. The tank will be capable of draining the inventory using gravity to facilitate repair and maintenance. 
Once we have modeled the tank and arrived at an optimal design, we will perform a detailed design and fabrication of the necessary components. The complete tank will be assembled and filled with a full inventory of molten glass for validation testing. 
Validation test protocol:
	1. Fill with molten glass inventory (powder form).
	2. Heat tank using internal heaters. 
	3. Maintain temperature at 1200 °C until equilibrated.
	4. Turn off internal heaters and measure temperature of glass over a 12 hour period.
	5. Verify that thermal losses are below target level.
Cold tank: The cold tank design must be capable of operating at a temperature of 400 °C with the molten glass. We will use a scaled version of the commercially deployed hot tank designs in current CSP plants [1]. This design uses a stainless steel alloy with external insulation only, and a thin aluminum skin. Heat losses from this design can be reduced to negligible levels by designing sufficiently thick external insulation. A review of literature and any relevant testing data will be conducted first to verify the compatibility of the chosen steel alloy with molten glass at 400 °C. Tank modeling, detailed design, and validation testing will proceed in a similar fashion as the hot tank described above.
Validation test protocol:
	1. Fill with molten glass inventory (powder form).
	2. Heat tank using internal heaters. 
	3. Maintain temperature at 400 °C until equilibrated.
	4. Turn off internal heaters and measure temperature of glass over a 12 hour period.
	5. Verify that thermal losses are below target level.
Key risks and recovery plan: For the hot tank, there is a risk that the internal insulation is not compatible with extended direct contact with molten glass. For example, if the glass permeates through the seams of the Monofrax bricks all the way to the external steel shell, the thermal conductivity may increase to unacceptable levels and result in greater heat losses, high shell temperatures, and shell corrosion. We will use advanced Monofrax sealing and joining techniques as a fallback, at an increased liner cost.
For the cold tank, there is a risk that steel is not compatible with the molten glass. This compatibility will be assessed first by a literature review and then by corrosion testing if necessary. We will use a nickel alloy as a fallback if steel proves inadequate.
There is additional risk that the tanks successfully hold the molten glass but have unacceptably high thermal losses, due to the small volume or the thermal leaks caused by instrumentation. We will attempt to create a conservative design with adequate thermal insulation in order to achieve the high efficiency we desire. We have also set a fallback target to hit if our aggressive target is not feasible. 
Task 7: Pump modeling
Figure 9: Viscosity pump for pumping molten glass [6].
The viscosity pump concept is a unique pump design that was developed for the production of glass fiber. This process involves the extrusion of the glass at elevated pressure through nozzles. We will develop a theoretical model to predict the flow and efficiency of the pump as a function of glass viscosity. The focus of this modeling work will not be on rigorous computational fluid dynamics or finite elements analysis; rather it will be a design tool only so we can verify the function of our design with adequate accuracy before fabricating the necessary components and building the system. The pump model will allow us to verify its suitability for both the hot and the cold tank.
Parasitic pumping losses are expected to be small at commercial scale, likely less than 1% of gross plant output [7], since molten glass has a high volumetric heat capacity and therefore will have low volumetric flow rates. See Figure 9 for a schematic diagram of this concept.
Task 8: Pump design and testing
Once we have a complete model to be used as a design tool we will fabricate a proof of concept alpha prototype viscosity pump and use it to pump a fluid of similar viscosity at ambient temperature. For example, if we expect the molten glass to have a viscosity of 1000 cP at 400 °C we will select a proxy fluid with a viscosity of 1000 cP at room temperature in order to validate the functionality of our design. This low temperature prototype will be constructed from readily available materials such as plastic and aluminum as appropriate. 
The design and fabrication of beta prototype viscosity pumps capable of operating at full temperature a (400 °C and 1200 °C) will be the next step in pump development. The overall geometry developed in the previous task will be used for this design, with modifications made to account for the high temperature operation. The design will consist of a drum with axial cooling passageways to keep moving parts at an acceptable temperature. The surface of the drum will be clad with a refractory metal such as molybdenum or alternatively a thin platinum or ceramic layer. The geometry for the cold pump (high viscosity, low temperature) will vary as necessary from the hot pump (low viscosity, high temperature) in order to achieve the desired flow and pressure.
Hot pump validation test protocol:
	1. Fill hot tank with molten glass inventory (powder form).
	2. Heat tank using internal heaters. 
	3. Maintain temperature at 1200 °C until equilibrated.
	4. Activate pump and pump molten glass into the cold tank or external storage vessel.
	5. Verify satisfactory pump performance.
Cold pump validation test protocol:
	1. Fill cold tank with molten glass inventory (powder form).
	2. Heat tank using internal heaters. 
	3. Maintain temperature at 400 °C until equilibrated.
	4. Activate pump and pump molten glass into the hot tank or external storage vessel.
	5. Verify satisfactory pump performance.
Key risks and recovery plan: There is a risk that the viscosity pump concept cannot generate sufficient pressure or flow to achieve the desired performance for the prototype. Or the pump may function at very low efficiency. We will use a compressed gas method to force the molten glass through the pipes as a fallback plan. Pressurizing the cold tank with an inert gas such as argon would reliably move the glass through the heater. The method could similarly be used to move the glass from the hot tank through the heat exchanger. Positive displacement pumps made of stainless steel or nickel alloys (for the cold pump) or refractory alloys (for the hot pump) are another alternative design. If the glass is too viscous to pump at 400 °C, we will consider raising the minimum temperature of the cold tank in order to reduce the glass viscosity and enable satisfactory pump operation. A cold tank at 500 °C, for example, will still allow us to demonstrate the validity of our design.

Task 9: Heat exchanger modeling
We will develop a thermal model of the direct contact heat exchanger in order to predict its performance during system testing. We will first assess available literature on similar designs [14]. Again, our focus will be on design and not extended theoretical exercise. The goal of this task will be to develop a tool to predict the necessary height, flow rate, and droplet geometry of our design. The inlet manifold “showerhead” design will be modeled to understand methods for producing uniform droplet size. Sonication methods will be considered to achieve this if necessary. See Figure 10 for a schematic diagram of the liquid droplet heat exchanger (LDHX) exchanging heat between falling glass droplets and pressurized air flowing up.
Task 10: Heat exchanger design and testing
Once we have completed the modeling work we will construct a proof of concept prototype heat exchanger to use at low temperature. This alpha prototype will consist of a vertical polycarbonate pipe (clear for visual observation of the droplets) with an inlet manifold and droplet nozzle at the top. At the bottom will be a collection manifold and inlet for cold air. We will use a proxy fluid with similar viscosity and density to the expected molten glass (such as glycerine or silicone oil). This fluid will be heated to a moderate temperature of approximately 80 °C and exchange heat with air pumped through the device at ambient temperature. The outlet for the heated air will be at the top of the device. 
The design and fabrication of a LDHX beta prototype capable of operating at full temperature a (400 °C and 1200 °C) will be the final step in heat exchanger development. The overall geometry developed in the previous task will be used for this design, with modifications made to account for the high temperature operation. The vertical column will consist of a stainless steel shell lined with Monofrax bricks. Molten glass will enter the top of the column at 1200 °C and exchange heat with air flowing up the column. The glass will be collected at the bottom of the column at 400 °C. Air will be pre-heated to 400 °C and pumped into the bottom of the column. The hot air at temperatures approaching 1200 °C will exit the top of the column and be allowed to dissipate. 
A full pressure prototype heat exchanger feeding hot gas to a small turbine is beyond the scope of this project, but is not necessary to prove the validity of the design. The pressure inside the column will be kept near ambient levels for safety and simplicity. Full scale designs must operate at the pressure of the outlet of the compressor on the gas turbine, typically 20-30 bar. Once our design has been proven to operate at full temperature, it will be readily scaled up and utilized at full pressure in future development efforts. 
Validation test protocol:
	1. Fill hot tank with molten glass inventory (powder form).
	2. Heat tank using internal heaters. 
	3. Maintain temperature at 1200 °C until equilibrated.
	4. Activate pump and pump molten glass into the cold tank through the heat exchanger.
	5. Measure heat output to verify adequate radiator performance.
Key risks and recovery plan: There is a risk that the LDHX will not achieve the desired heat flow out of the molten glass. The detailed design, with complex fluid dynamics and steep thermal gradients may require too many iterations to be successful within the project period. We will use a simple radiative heat sink as an alternative fallback design consisting of a series of small diameter molybdenum tubes in quartz sleeves through which the glass flows in parallel. A large aluminum panel rests behind the pipes. A fan blows across the pipes and the aluminum panel, producing a large heat transfer coefficient and allowing the heat flux to be controlled by varying the fan speed. We will use a powerful fan for forced convection. We will also consider a cold water jacket to achieve sufficient cooling, increasing the length of the cooling pipes, or increasing the allowable discharge period.
Task 11: Furnace modeling
A key focus of the proposed project is to build a prototype thermal storage system that in every practical way mimics a full scale commercial CSP plant. We propose using a radiant heat source to heat the molten glass as it flows through a pipe, much like a full scale receiver would do when subjected to concentrated insolation. We will use a commercially available laboratory tube furnace as the heat source of our prototype system. Many models are available from manufacturers such as Blue M and others for maximum temperatures up to 1700 °C. However, these furnaces are designed to operate under near adiabatic conditions. We will be actively cooling the furnace with the flowing molten glass. We will develop a thermal model of the furnace and molten glass coolant to verify that we can reliably heat the glass to 1200 °C using radiative heat transfer. We will use MATLAB to develop a numerical model of the tube furnace, metal pipe, and flowing molten glass system. This modeling work will result in a design tool that we can use to verify the function of our design with adequate accuracy before purchasing the necessary components and building the system. 
Task 12: Furnace testing
Validation test protocol:
	1. Fill cold tank with molten glass inventory (powder form).
	2. Heat tank using internal heaters. 
	3. Maintain temperature at 400 °C until equilibrated.
	4. Activate pump and pump molten glass into the hot tank through the tube furnace.
	5. Measure heat input to verify adequate furnace performance.
Key risks and recovery plan: There is a risk that the radiative heater tube furnace cannot achieve sufficient heat flow into the molten glass. We will reduce the flow rate and thermal power input of the molten glass as a fallback in order to achieve the desired temperature.
Task 13: Full system design and assembly
The full system test of our thermal energy storage prototype is the final hardware deliverable of the proposed project. Phase 1 of this program focuses on developing the critical components necessary for the proposed thermal storage system. Phase 2 focuses on integrating the separate components into a complete prototype system, capable of heating, pumping, storing, and cooling the molten glass. We will fully instrument the prototype system, including measuring the temperature, pressure, and flow rate at key points. See Table 2 for a list of the instrumentation. Thermocouples will typically be K-type or another variety suitable for a molten glass environment. Pressure transducers will use a manometer design with the fluid column height measured by laser [15]. This design avoids direct contact with the hot molten glass. Flow sensors will be a thermal flow meter design which inputs a known heat flow and measures the temperature rise in the fluid. This data can be used to calculate the mass flow rate. All data from the instrumentation will be monitored and recorded with a data acquisition system operated with LabVIEW. 
The full system design includes important items such as balance of plant components, instrumentation, connectors/fittings, facilities, ventilation, and safety equipment/procedures. The facilities where we will assemble and test the full prototype will be capable of high voltage electrical service adequate for running the furnaces and pumps simultaneously. It will also have sufficient ventilation to dissipate the hot air generated by the process.

Task 14: System testing
Complete system testing will verify the performance over a 24 hour period.
Validation test protocol:
	1. Fill cold tank with molten glass inventory (powder form).
	2. Heat tank using internal heaters. 
	3. Maintain temperature at 400 °C until equilibrated.
	4. Activate cold pump and pump molten glass into the hot tank through the tube furnace.
	5. Charge for 6 hours at 5 kWt.
	6. Monitor heat input to verify adequate furnace performance.
	7. Hold glass at 1200 °C in hot tank for 12 hours. Monitor heat losses.
	8. Activate hot pump and pump molten glass into the cold tank through the heat exchanger. 
	9. Discharge for 6 hours at 5 kWt.
	10. Monitor heat output to verify adequate heat exchanger performance.
The complete system prototype will function as a flexible platform for subsequent testing and development, including startup/shutdown procedures, freeze recovery techniques, materials compatibility studies, heat transfer coefficient measurement of molten glass, and many other possible tests. This in-depth testing is beyond the scope of the proposed 24 month project but will be pursued in future development efforts leading to commercialization.
Key risks and recovery plan: The major risk for the final task is a failure of component integration to achieve full system operation. We will attempt to fully validate each subsystem as a fallback. For example, if there in an issue with controlling the cold pump and the tube furnace simultaneously, we will validate each component separately to show charging capability, then use the hot pump and heat sink simultaneously to show integrated discharge capability. The system as a whole can be run as two independent subsystems: the charging subsystem (cold tank, cold pump, tube furnace) and the discharging subsystem (hot tank, hot pump, heat exchanger). This modularity allows flexibility in system control and validation testing.
Task 15: Technology transfer and outreach
The overall goal of the proposed program is to develop a commercially viable thermal energy storage system. In order to accomplish this goal we will focus on engaging target customers, suppliers, and the general public in addition to the technical tasks of the program. The project team will attend relevant industry trade shows and conferences, discussion panels, and symposia. We will visit key customers and partners. We will purchase market reports and publications in order to stay abreast of our technology developments. 
Our efforts will be structured around a comprehensive outreach program: “The Promise of Thermal Storage,” focused on educating stakeholders (utilities, customers, and the general public) on the value of our proposed technology. Activities under this program will include workshops, discussion panels, blogs, interviews with the media, and appearances at local governing body meetings.

a Projected cost at commercial scale. Cost for developing first of a kind prototype will be higher.
b Estimate from measured corrosion rate (TBD) of refractory tank lining.
We estimate capital costs of storage by first assuming we can develop an advanced molten glass that costs $500/ton (50% less than currently used molten salts). We estimate capital costs for the tank and balance of plant by scaling to 1/8th in volume (vs. Andasol) but 50% higher unit costs due to more expensive construction materials. This estimate results in $12/kWht, a 10X reduction in costs vs. today’s technology.
We estimate approximately 88 kg of molten glass to achieve 30 kWht of energy storage with our prototype. Assuming a low density for glass (2 kg/L) and allowing for generous insulation and pump volumes results in a volumetric energy density of 170 kWht/m3.

Statement of Project Objectives (1 page)
Objectives:
Halotechnics proposes to develop a thermal storage system utilizing a low melting point molten glass as the heat transfer and thermal storage material. An advanced glass represents a potential breakthrough in a low cost, earth abundant, and stable thermal storage material. This novel material will enable unprecedented efficiency with thermal energy storage exploiting sensible heat. We will develop a two-tank thermal storage system operating at a hot temperature of 1200 °C and a cold temperature of 400 °C. This project will leverage technology used in the modern glass industry, with decades of experience in handling high temperature viscous materials. Halotechnics will combine its proven expertise in combinatorial chemistry with advanced techniques for handling molten glass. The molten glass thermal storage system has the potential to reduce thermal storage costs by a factor of ten once developed and deployed at commercial scale. Thermal storage at the target temperature can be integrated with existing high temperature gas turbines that significantly increase efficiencies over today’s steam turbine technology.
Scope of Work: 
Halotechnics has formed a project team with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, a world leading engineering firm with experience in aerospace and power generation. We propose to design and build a complete lab scale prototype of an advanced sensible heat thermal storage system. Phase 1 of the program will focus on validating the critical components of the system at a prototype level. We will optimize the glass material and develop a pump, tank design, and heat exchanger capable of performing under aggressive thermal environments. Phase 2 will focus on integrating each component into a complete thermal storage system capable of pumping, heating, storing, and discharging the advanced molten glass.
If successful this project will be both transformative and disruptive. We propose to translate technology developed by the glass industry and use it to transform a new sector – to develop cheap thermal energy storage for concentrating solar power (CSP).
 
Technical Milestones and Deliverables (5 pages)
The advanced molten glass thermal storage system is currently at TRL 3. We have a proof of concept glass material and conceptual designs for critical components of the system. At the conclusion of Phase 1 of the project (months 0-12) we will have progressed the technology to TRL 4. The glass material will be optimized; the glass pump will be built and a viscous fluid will be pumped, other critical components will be identified and engineering specifications developed.  At the conclusion of Phase 2 of this project (months 13-24) we will have advanced the technology to TRL 5. We will integrate all the critical components and build a high-fidelity laboratory prototype that operates at full temperature.

Dr. Robert W. Bradshaw
I was a Principal Member of the Technical Staff (Chemical Engineering) at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA until retiring in 2010. My technical work has involved a broad range of areas related to high temperature materials and chemistry and corrosion of metals (both high temperature and aqueous environments). I have conducted studies of gaseous reactions of bromine to produce hydrobromic acid at elevated temperatures and the equilibrium behavior of the Iodine-HI-H2O system. I have developed modified Fe-Cr-Mo steel compositions that demonstrated superior corrosion resistance in molten salt environments compared to the standard alloy. I developed high-temperature alloys for coal gasification applications and conducted experimental evaluations of their sulfidation resistance in laboratory tests at high pressure and temperature to simulate coal gasification environments. 
My other recent R&D work involved materials and process chemistry issues related to chemical munitions disposal and a novel freeze desalination method that was awarded a patent. I have conducted experimental studies the oxidation reactivity of hydrides for hydrogen storage media and evaluated novel bench-scale reactors for reforming hydrocarbons. I have conducted materials compatibility studies in a variety of environments related to Sandia’s defense projects and 
My molten salt research has spanned several decades at Sandia beginning with the initial development of solar central receiver technology in the 1980's. I was generally responsible for establishing Sandia’s molten salt research program which supported the Laboratory’s development of advanced concentrating solar power (CSP) technology. I developed innovative methods to expand the working temperature range of molten nitrate salts for the primary solar thermal energy collection systems (towers and troughs) and thermal energy storage. These approaches enabled reducing the freezing point of molten salts (simplifying system operation) or increasing the maximum operating temperature (raising system efficiency). Two patents were awarded for these low-freezing molten salt formulations. I determined experimentally the chemical stability limits (equilibrium chemistry properties) of various molten salt mixtures and measured their physical properties, viscosity and density. I designed corrosion experiments to evaluate the compatibility of engineering alloys and other materials under conditions that prevail in CSP systems and conducted the metallurgical evaluation of the alloys. These studies qualified materials that were subsequently used to construct CSP demonstration systems and operating plants. I developed and demonstrated a technique to reduce the cost of phase-change thermal energy storage.

Participating Organizations (1 page)
The capabilities of the proposed project partners – Halotechnics and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne – are complementary and result in a strengthened team. Halotechnics has expertise in materials science, chemistry, and thermal systems engineering. Its strength is in novel discovery and design at a laboratory scale. PWR is a leader in advanced engineering and design for extreme environments in the aerospace and power generation industry. By leveraging each party’s strengths we propose to design a thermal energy storage prototype with maximum commercial relevance. The proposed prototype will be designed with an eye toward scaling to full commercial size, using relevant component designs, alloys, and other materials that are commercially available at a large scale. 
About Halotechnics: Founded in 2009 by Dr. Justin Raade as a spin-out from pioneer Symyx Technologies, Halotechnics draws upon a rich heritage in combinatorial chemistry extending back to 1996. The innovation proposed here fits squarely into our company mission: to develop and commercialize advanced thermal energy storage systems enabled by our proprietary materials. Receiving the ARPA-E award would be instrumental in making our vision a reality, since the project’s risk cannot justify venture investment or traditional corporate R&D funds. We must prove that the system works before securing traditional funding to scale it up for commercial deployment. 
Halotechnics has a proven track record of early stage product development and is currently commercializing the results of R&D. Our core expertise leverages high throughput materials discovery methods to rapidly develop novel materials. We have developed powerful software tools and experimental apparatus for synthesizing and characterizing materials. Halotechnics has the chemistry and materials science expertise to synthesize and screen thousands of candidate materials for desirable properties and low cost. We have the informatics know-how to design, analyze, and store the data resulting from our materials screening. We have the engineering expertise to take the hits from our materials screening and build them into advanced thermal energy storage systems, validating their performance under realistic operating conditions at the laboratory scale and larger.
About Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR): Located in Canoga Park, PWR is a global engineering leader that designs and produces some of the world's most sophisticated hardware. Our emphasis on high power density energy conversion brings knowledge of extreme operating conditions (cryogenic to 3300 °C, vacuum to 9,000 psi), cutting-edge material developments and objective application of engineering and scientific methods. We have five decades of rocket engine experience covering safety, conduits, mixing, combustion, pumping, and storage in liquid and gaseous states. We use a multi-disciplined, systems approach to assure a comprehensive result.
PWR has unique abilities and experience that make it qualified for the alternative energy industry and in particular the solar energy industry. PWR has the infrastructure and resources consisting of processes and personnel to develop and advance energy technologies. In addition, PWR’s experience with liquid metals and molten salts from its heritage nuclear programs at Atomics International and the Energy Technology Engineering Center (ETEC) is invaluable in understanding materials compatibility.
PWR has been involved in solar power programs since the 1980s. PWR has experience in molten salt receiver systems stemming back to the Solar Two pilot plant project in the 1990s, which was an extension of the work done before on the Solar One project. PWR has extensive experience in many technologies relevant to CSP systems including solar power tower designs and technologies extensible to thermal storage systems adapted for solar trough plants.

Management Plan (1 page)
Roles of Project Team Members: Halotechnics will lead the development of the advanced molten glass and the critical components of the thermal energy storage system (pumps, tanks, and heat exchanger design). PWR will be responsible for surveying feasible alloys and joining techniques that may be compatible with the molten glass. PWR’s contribution will be embodied in the Materials Survey Report deliverable (Phase 1). PWR will also provide input during review meetings of corrosion testing data (Phase 2).
The main objectives of the procedures presented in this section are:
	* To establish clear organizational structure and working procedures, which will ensure smooth flow of the work and seamless interfaces between PWR and Halotechnics.
	* To allow effective control of the work process and to supply measures that will assure the required quality. 
	* To ensure that the work will be documented, distributed and filed properly, during and as well as at the end of the development project.
	* To allow remedial actions to be performed professionally and swiftly. 
Meetings: Internal meetings will be held within each company as required or directed by the project manager. Regular teleconferences will be scheduled between Halotechnics and PWR as necessary in order to stay on schedule and meet milestones. Face to face meetings will take place periodically; transportation is readily available between Halotechnics in the San Francisco Bay Area and PWR in southern California.
Any meeting, discussion or telephone conversation which has record value will be recorded and summarized in minutes that will be distributed to meeting participants. It is the responsibility of meetings participants to agree at the start of each meeting on the person assuming the task of summarizing and distributing the meeting notes.
The minutes contents will note, at least, the following items: 
	* Place and date of meeting
	* Meeting participants
	* Meeting aim
	* Issues discussed according the meeting agenda
	* Meeting conclusions
	* Actions to carry out including execution dates and the people in charge of them
Schedules & Follow-up: Halotechnics and PWR will prepare an overall and detailed project schedule identifying critical path, priority activities, target dates for milestones completion and material flow, along with required resources to accomplish the work. The schedule will be reviewed with both companies management and finalized per their inputs. Schedule will be updated periodically according to the actual work performed and actual progress done. 
Periodical review meetings with project member management will be scheduled in order to follow up on project progress, pin-point outstanding problems and decide on remedy actions.

Table 5: Major equipment purchases.
Manufacturing costs:
The advanced glass developed by this project will be manufactured at large scale using well-established techniques practiced by the modern glass industry. Glass raw materials are first crushed and mixed in the desired proportions, heated in large refractory lined furnaces until a homogeneous mixture is reached, and then formed into the desired shape. Commercial glass furnaces typically produce 400 tons per day or more.
The glass developed by this project will be formed into fine pellets or a powder for distribution to customer’s solar plants. The glass will be melted and loaded into the customer’s storage tanks on site.
We are targeting a cost less than $500/ton for the raw materials and production cost of our advanced molten glass (50% less than currently used molten salts). The earth abundant components are intend to use in our glass are commonly available for $80-$500/ton, produced in quantities of millions of tons worldwide. Glass containers and flat glass with traditional compositions are commonly produced today for costs near $100/ton.
We estimate capital costs for the tank and balance of plant by scaling to 1/8th in volume (vs. Andasol) but 50% higher unit costs due to more expensive construction materials. This estimate results in $12/kWht, a 10x reduction in costs vs. today’s technology.

 
Transition/Commercialization Strategy (2 pages)
Halotechnics is developing the most advanced heat transfer fluids in the world for high temperature industrial processes. We have secured government research funds from DOE and NSF and are currently in the process of commercializing the advanced molten salt products resulting from those projects. We believe that the sun is the ultimate energy source. By leveraging government funds for high risk, high reward R&D, followed by private investment directed toward commercialization, we aim to make the biggest commercial impact possible in order to achieve the vision of the SunShot Initiative and reduce the nation’s dependence on imported energy.
As a first mover in the field of molten glass heat transfer and thermal energy storage, Halotechnics stands poised to capture a significant portion of this emerging market. Our strategy is to gain first-mover advantage, build a name for the company by establishing a presence at industry conferences and trade shows, and to get out in front and keep innovating. 
Business Model and Customers
Halotechnics is the architect of thermal storage. Our thermal energy storage systems will achieve market-leading low installation cost due to our advanced designs enabled by proprietary storage materials. We are the world expert in molten salt – its chemistry and how it behaves, how to procure it, how to manufacture it, and how to use it in full-scale plants. CSP plants are typically built by EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) firms. Halotechnics provides Engineering services for the thermal energy storage system to project developers. We do the detailed engineering design of the thermal energy storage system – the pumps, pipes, tank design, materials selection, and preferred suppliers. This is the ‘E’ in EPC. 
For the molten salt, our area of expertise, we provide the complete engineering, procurement, construction, and management solution to our customers. We leverage our relationships with salt suppliers to procure the lowest cost components. We understand the chemistry of our proprietary salt products and know how they behave at large scale during long term operation. We coordinate the logistics to deliver the raw material components to the customer’s site. We set up mobile manufacturing facilities to crush, mix, melt, and install our products into the thermal storage tanks of the customer’s plant. And finally we offer complete maintenance, diagnostic, and repair services for the molten salt inventory.
Ours is a capital efficient business model since our main product is the know-how for building a competitive thermal energy storage system. The manufacturing equipment necessary for the installation of the molten salt inventory is readily available and can be set up under tents in temporary facilities at each plant site. The U.S. based plants we design will be built with U.S. labor and will typically source a majority of the components from domestic sources. 
We see an opportunity to take a leading position in high temperature thermal energy storage at operating temperatures greater than 565 °C. Halotechnics has invented breakthrough heat transfer fluid enabling operation at 700 °C. The proposed project would allow us to expand our expertise to include molten glass in addition to molten salt, for applications up to 1200 °C. There are currently no commercially available components for pumping, storing, and controlling the flow of storage fluids at these temperatures. Receiving the proposed award would provide a jump-start on developing our advanced prototype systems. 
The concentrating solar power industry is constrained by the requirements of project finance; every aspect of a $1-2 billion plant must have a 20 year track record of proven performance, or have the guarantee of a company with a big balance sheet willing to back the technology. Halotechnics will form strategic alliances with leading EPC firms in order to achieve bankability with our technology. We will build a pilot scale thermal energy storage system with our partner firm to build confidence in the performance of our products. We will then do the detailed engineering for a full scale commercial plant. We must establish a strong relationship with our EPC partner and they will then provide a guarantee on the performance of our designs. In this manner Halotechnics will provide the ‘E’ and our partner firm will provide the ‘PC.’ We have a goal to achieve bankability (technology capable of securing project finance) with our products by 2013. Potential EPC partners include Bechtel, Fluor, Sener, Abener, and other who are active in CSP project development. 
Post Award Activities Leading to Commercialization
Our strategy with the proposed project will be to eliminate the science risk associated with our advanced molten glass thermal storage concept. We will obtain data validating the performance of the novel material and thermal storage system by successfully completing the project. At the conclusion of the ARPA-E project we will seek venture funding to build a pilot scale system and develop the full-scale engineering design for deployment at commercial CSP facilities. After proving the technology at pilot scale we will enter the full scale commercial market as a thermal storage system technology provider. We intend to become a reliable partner for CSP project developers seeking to build low-cost, high temperature plants. We will partner with large companies in order to make our technology bankable.
If we are successful in the proposed project for a 1200 °C thermal energy storage system we will seek to scale up the prototype to a pilot scale system built with additional grant funds and private capital. This pilot system will include a molten salt inventory of approximately 1,000 tons and will cost $8-10 million. Halotechnics will seek private investment from venture capital firms or strategic partners in order to leverage any federal funds provided for pilot scale development. We are projecting a total venture investment of $12-15 million in order to build out our sales and business teams, expand our engineering and services capability, and provide for materials and construction costs of pilot scale plants. After securing this investment and successfully completing a pilot project we anticipate that we will have sufficient data and proven performance with our system designs that we will be able to secure an EPC partner and a bankable guarantee for our designs. At this point we anticipate receiving an increasing number of contracts to sell our guaranteed designs to project developers who are building advanced CSP plants with thermal energy storage. We will be cash flow positive and profitable due to our capital efficient business model. Our most likely exit scenario would be acquisition in 5-6 years by a large EPC firm or solar technology firm who wishes to gain exclusive access to our must-have thermal energy storage technology.
 
Intellectual Property Strategy (no limit)
Halotechnics has filed one provisional patent relevant to the proposed project: “Molten glass for heat transfer and thermal energy storage,” U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/486,046. Additional patent applications will be filed to protect the technology proposed in this document. Expected patents fall in the following general categories:
	* Composition of matter. These patent claims cover the proportion of each oxide or other constituent in the preferred mixtures; the formula.
	* Synthesis process. These patent claims will specify the temperature, duration, and other steps and techniques for synthesizing the proprietary glass materials.
	* Novel use. It may be possible to develop an existing material for a novel use, analogous to a pharmaceutical firm patenting a previously known chemical compound to treat a disease.
	* Related equipment. We will expand our IP portfolio to include related technology for wetted components in the plant: coatings, pumps, tanks, system design.
As of the date of this submission there has not yet been a memorandum of understanding signed between team members. Intellectual property will prospectively be allocated as follows: 
	* Materials for heat transfer and thermal storage (Halotechnics)
	* Component and system design (Halotechnics)
	* Techniques and apparatus for synthesizing and screening materials (Halotechnics)
	* Pre-existing IP related to alloys and joining techniques (PWR)
SaltstreamTM Product Line
Halotechnics is developing a suite of branded molten salt products for heat transfer and thermal energy storage in applications ranging from 500 °C to 1200 °C. 
	* Saltstream 500 is a mixture of nitrate salts designed for next generation trough CSP plants operating at 500 °C. Previously available molten salt mixtures melt at 140 °C or higher, but Saltstream 500 melts at 65 °C. 
	* Saltstream 565 is a drop-in replacement for central receiver CSP plants operating at 565 °C. It has similar physical properties as previous molten salt materials but 20% lower cost due to our use of earth abundant components. 
	* Saltstream 700 is designed for next generation central receiver CSP plants. It consists of chloride salts stable to 700 °C and has an unprecedented low melting point near 250 °C.
	* GT 1200 is the prospective trade name for the material to be developed by the proposed project. It is a tailor-made fluid for the requirements of commercially available gas turbine combined cycle power blocks. It is a novel earth abundant material suitable for pumped heat transfer and thermal energy storage applications at extremely high temperatures up to 1200 °C.
We have patents pending on each of the proprietary materials described above. We intend to use this IP protection to give us a competitive advantage in achieving high performance thermal energy storage systems that cannot be duplicated by any competitor.
 
Additionality and Risk (2 pages)
We believe our proposed thermal storage system represents a challenging project with significant technical risk. We have constructed a reasonable approach to tackle the design problems step-by-step. And if we are successful in demonstrating our prototype we will make today’s thermal storage technology obsolete. We are driven by the promise of an earth abundant thermal storage material and system that couples directly to high performance gas turbine combined cycle power blocks. The reward of developing such a technology would be electricity from the sun, day and night, at a cost cheaper than fossil fuels.
At the current level of technology readiness, the technology for thermal energy storage at high temperature is too risky for traditional venture capital investment or corporate R&D budgets. ARPA-E provides a crucial role in funding high impact R&D at this stage. Thermal storage at 565 °C is established technology. However thermal storage at 1200 °C represents a significant risk to project developers. There are no commercially available pumps, pipes, storage vessels, or heat transfer fluids that can reach this operating temperature. Even if isolated components were available there has never been a demonstration of a heat transfer and thermal storage system operating anywhere close to this temperature. For this reason solar companies cannot justify their R&D investments to invent this technology from scratch. Leading central receiver developers are looking to 700 °C for their next generation plants. Going to 1200 °C would leapfrog the intermediate temperature entirely.
The proposed technology must overcome significant market risk. Venture capital investors typically do not fund R&D. They fund commercialization. If we are successful in demonstrating at a lab scale a breakthrough fluid with compelling heat transfer properties and dirt cheap cost, as well as the system to pump and store that novel fluid, this is the natural entry point for venture capital. Halotechnics intends to raise venture capital once we have developed the technology and removed the science risk. The analogy venture capitalists like to say goes as follows: “Bring us your magic fluid in a vial. We’ll invest and turn that vial into thousands of tons.” ARPA-E funding would allow us to develop that vial and subsequently begin the process of scaling to full commercial deployment. The proposed market for our technology, concentrating solar power, represents large growth potential but today is still relatively small. Investors will come to the market once scale takes hold and a positive feedback loops occurs – more people, including the public and politicians, seeing CSP plants under construction and operating, delivering the goods of clean reliable electricity. 
We believe that the heat transfer fluid and thermal storage system is the key enabling technology that will open up a new field for concentrating solar power and set us on the path toward achieving the SunShot goals by 2020. However, after a successful R&D program focused on thermal storage, additional challenges will remain. The receiver design capable of operating at 1200 °C represents a significant challenge. We will lay the groundwork for this subsequent development effort by working with PWR on material selection and joining technology for pipes compatible with molten glass. However the detailed design and demonstration of such a receiver will require future R&D. The next step after the successful development of a thermal storage system and prototype receiver operating at 1200 °C would be the development of a pilot scale plant that integrates these two crucial subsystems. A project such as this would also require the integration of a commercially available gas turbine. Such turbines are available in a wide variety of sizes from 5 MW up to 500 MW, but all are design to burn fuel internally with a combustor. The plant envisioned by this proposal would require a turbine to be modified to accept heat from an external source. By focusing first on thermal storage, then on receiver design, and finally on pilot scale system integration, we believe that the goals of the SunShot Initiative are within reach.
The proposed project will enhance economic security by promoting domestic mining and manufacturing. The raw materials and components we propose to use in our prototype could come primarily from domestic sources and therefore enhance domestic economic productivity. The U.S. glass industry would benefit by an injection of new technology and access to a new growth market – concentrating solar power – with significant social and economic benefits.

Deep Eutectic Salt Formulations Suitable as Advanced Heat Transfer Fluids
	Funding amount
$1.5 million
	Beginning and end dates
September 30, 2008 to June 30, 2012
	Abstract of project
Halotechnics is conducting a high-throughput combinatorial research and development program focusing on deep eutectic salt formulations.  Molten salts exhibit many desirable heat transfer qualities within the range of the project objectives but typically have high freezing points.  Halotechnics is investigating complex mixtures of inorganic salts to discover deep eutectic or low freezing point formulations suitable as advanced heat transfer fluids.  In order to effectively map out the phase space in a reasonable amount of time, Halotechnics is combining the power of high throughput combinatorial discovery tools (for fast materials synthesis and characterization) with an efficient methodology for the design of experiments (to eliminate redundant or infeasible zones of the design space).  Approximately 10,000 candidate formulations have been screened to date.  The discovery program will focus on experimental methods to acquire data on the behavior of salt formulations and will utilize theoretical modeling techniques where advantageous.  The final HTF candidates will be submitted for scale-up field testing at Sandia National Laboratories which will serve to validate their performance under pilot scale CSP plant conditions.
	Specific aims
The aim of this project is to develop advanced heat transfer fluids for applications in solar thermal power generation. Halotechnics is targeting two materials under this program. 1) A low melting point nitrate/nitrite based fluid stable to 500 °C. This fluid is designed for advanced parabolic trough plants. 2) a low cost nitrate based molten salt stable to 565 °C. This fluid is designed for central receiver power plants.

Advanced Molten Salt Heat Transfer and Thermal Storage Material for Central Receiver Solar Thermal Power Generation
	Funding amount
$150,000 (SBIR Phase 1)
	Beginning and end dates
January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011
	Abstract of project
Intellectual Merit: This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project proposes developing a novel molten salt heat transfer and thermal storage material for central receiver solar thermal power generation. Solar thermal technology developers are pushing to increase the operating temperature of their systems, thereby lowering their levelized cost of electricity and reducing the cost of storage. Known salt mixtures considered for heat transfer fluids have high melting points typically over 300 °C or insufficient thermal stability. Halotechnics will conduct a high throughput materials discovery program to rapidly screen over 2000 unique mixtures of inorganic salts and to discover a novel eutectic mixture with a low melting point of 200 °C and a high maximum temperature of 700 °C. This broad operating range is currently unavailable with any commercially feasible material in the marketplace. Discovering new eutectic mixtures is a combinatorial problem, since the number of possible mixtures increases exponentially with the number of components. We will apply combinatorial chemistry techniques, originally developed for pharmaceutical applications, to a new field: solar thermal materials.  Halotechnics will combine the power of high throughput discovery tools (for fast materials synthesis and characterization) with an optimized methodology for experiment design (to efficiently constrain the design space).
Broader Impacts: It is imperative that we reduce our usage of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and especially coal) to address pressing societal concerns – climate change and environmental degradation, energy security, and price volatility. Solar thermal power, a compelling source of renewable electricity at large scale, represents a possible solution to fossil fuel use. However, electricity from solar thermal power currently costs too much to be directly competitive with fossil fuels. Furthermore, although solar thermal plants have the capability of storing heat in order to produce power after sundown, this represents a significant capital cost to plant developers. In order to achieve large scale deployment and to compete with fossil fuels, there is a crucial need across the solar thermal industry to lower costs and develop viable thermal storage. At the heart of these plants is the heat transfer fluid and thermal storage material. The market for this crucial component is projected to reach $5.5 billion by 2020. The development of the proposed innovation would both reduce the cost of solar thermal power and enable economic thermal storage, bringing the nation significantly closer to eliminating the use of coal.  The goal is to enable cheap power from the sun day and night.
	Specific aims
The aim of this project is to develop advanced heat transfer fluids for applications in solar thermal power generation. Halotechnics is targeting a molten salt fluid with a melting point at 200 °C and stable to 700 °C. Candidate materials include novel mixtures of chloride, carbonate, and sulfate salts. This fluid is designed for next generation central receiver power plants.

	Title of project
Advanced Thermal Energy Storage System with SaltstreamTM Molten Salt
	Requested funding amount
$1 million
	Proposed beginning and end dates
November 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012
	Abstract of project
Halotechnics proposes to develop a thermal storage system utilizing a high stability, low melting point molten salt as the heat transfer and thermal storage material – SaltstreamTM 700. This advanced molten salt stable to 700 °C represents a potential breakthrough in a high performance thermal storage material for applications in concentrating solar power (CSP). This novel material will enable unprecedented efficiency with thermal energy storage exploiting sensible heat. This project will leverage technology used in the metal heat treating industry, with decades of experience in handling high temperature molten salt. We will develop a two-tank thermal storage system operating at a hot temperature of 700 °C and a cold temperature of 300 °C. The proposed project scope includes the development of the system to pump, heat, and store the novel material. Halotechnics will combine its proven expertise in combinatorial chemistry with advanced engineering designs for handling molten salt. The molten salt thermal storage system has the potential to reduce thermal storage costs by a factor of five once developed and deployed at commercial scale. 
Halotechnics has formed a project team with BrightSource Energy, the nation’s leading developer of utility-scale solar power. BrightSource will develop the system architecture of an advanced CSP plant operating at supercritical steam conditions approaching 700 °C. The proposed thermal storage system will be designed to fit directly into the plant envisioned by BrightSource. By leveraging the strengths of each project participant we intend to maximize the commercial impact of this technology and accelerate its deployment at full scale. 
	Specific aims
We propose to build a miniature CSP plant at a laboratory scale, with each critical component designed with an eye toward scalability to commercial size. This systematic approach will eliminate the greatest amount of risk from critical components of the molten salt thermal storage system. We will use a pipe passing through a tube furnace to simulate the radiant heating environment of salt flowing through the tubes of a receiver. We will design the molten salt pump using a long-shaft design conceptually similar to commercial-size molten salt pumps. We will use relevant alloys for piping and tank construction, not specialty items available only for small scale niche applications. Our 700 °C tank will be internally insulated with ceramic materials available in bulk quantities; once proven at laboratory scale, this tank design will lend itself naturally to scaling up to storing thousands of tons of salt and eliminating the need to use expensive nickel alloy construction. Our 300 °C tank design will be scaled directly from the cold salt tank design used at today’s commercial CSP plants (such as Andasol and Gemasolar).

	Description of project
Halotechnics proposes to build a complete thermal energy storage system prototype using SaltstreamTM molten salt, operating up to 565 °C. We will design and build a scaled down concentrating solar power plant in our laboratory to validate the performance of our products. Concentrating solar power plants generate electricity by focusing sunlight using mirrors onto a receiver, then passing a fluid through the receiver to collect the heat, and finally using the heated fluid to boil water and drive a steam turbine generator. Our prototype system will use radiative heaters to simulate the solar receiver and a heat sink to simulate the steam generator in a full size plant. This prototype is crucial to generate realistic operating data on our materials and designs. We are in discussions with five leading customers who are currently building molten salt concentrating solar power plants, but they must see real data of successful prototype operation in order to have confidence that our products will function as expected at large scale. Once successful at lab scale we will begin design and construction of a pilot scale system before full scale commercial deployment of our products.
