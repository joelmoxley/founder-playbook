Instructions and Summary																				
Control Number:	0471-1528		Date of Submission:			07/18/2011														
Award Recipient:	Halotechnics, Inc.		Submitted by: 			Halotechnics, Inc.														
																				
"Please read the instructions on each page before starting.  
If you have any questions, please submit to ARPA-E-CO@hq.doe.gov.  It will save you time!  "																				
"On this form, provide detailed support for the estimated total project costs identified on the SF-424A form (Budget).  X

• The totals in each budget category and the Total Project Cost must be the same in the SF-424A and the Budget Justification Workbook.  

• The Prime Recipient must complete the Budget Justification Workbook.  In addition, each Subrecipient incurring greater than or equal to 10% of the Total Project Cost must complete separate tabs in the Budget Justification Workbook to justify its proposed budget.  The tabs must be included in the Prime Recipient’s Budget Justification Workbook.  The term “tab” refers to a worksheet within the Budget Justification Workbook.  Each tab may be found and accessed at the bottom of the Workbook page.

• The total budget presented in the Budget Justification Workbook and the SF-424A must include both Federal (ARPA-E) and Non-Federal (cost share) expenditures, the sum of which equals the Total Project Cost proposed by the Applicant.  All costs, whether paid with Federal funding or by the Project Team, must be justified.  

• For costs in each budget category in the SF-424A, complete the corresponding worksheet in this Workbook.  The totals in each budget category and the Total Project Cost must be the same in the SF-424A and the Budget Justification Workbook.  

• All costs incurred by the Prime Recipient’s Subrecipients, vendors, contractors, consultants and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), must be entered only in section f. Contractual.  All other sections are for the costs of the Prime Recipient only.

• No individual may be paid more than $200,000 per year under an ARPA-E funding agreement. 

• All expenditures must be allowable, allocable, and reasonable in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles.

d. Equipment											
"PLEASE READ!!!

""Equipment"" is generally defined as an item with an acquisition cost greater than $5,000 and a useful life expectancy of more than one year.  Further definitions can be found at 10 C.F.R. 600.

List all proposed equipment below, providing a basis of cost such as vendor quotes, catalog prices, prior invoices, etc., and briefly justify its need as it applies to the Statement of Project Objectives and accompanying Technical Milestones and Deliverables.  If it is existing equipment, and the value of its contribution to the project budget is being shown as cost share, provide logical support for the estimated value shown.  If it is new equipment which will retain a useful life upon completion of the project, provide logical support for the estimated value shown.

For equipment over $50,000 in price, also include a copy of the associated vendor quote or catalog price list.

Add rows as needed.  If rows are added, formulas/calculations may need to be adjusted by the preparer. "

AdditionalExplanations/Comments (as necessary)											
Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne costs are budgeted based upon previous work with similar scope conducted at PWR. Since this previous experience was for a power system operating at lower temperatures and a less corrosive fluid environment, and because joining techniques is added beyond the scope of the previous work, the task budget was increased 2X to cover the extra technical challenges that include a small set of readily available engineering data for material selection at 1200C. PWR will  provide a Materials Survey Report, including candidate alloys matrix with properties, costs, and joining techniques. PWR will be involved in Piping Material Selection (Task 3) and will also review data resulting from corrosion testing of selected alloys (Task 4).

h. Other Direct Costs						
"PLEASE READ!!!

Applicants must provide and justify proposed costs related to Other Direct Costs for each year of the entire budget period.  Other Direct Costs are direct cost items required for the project which do not fit clearly into other categories, and are not included in the indirect pool for which the indirect rate is being applied to this project.  Other Direct Costs include Technology Transfer and Outreach (TT&O) activities.  Examples of TT&O activities that are allowable under Federal costs principles are provided in Section IV.G.8 of the FOA.   Applicants must provide a basis of cost (e.g., vendor quotes, prior purchases of similar or like items, published price list, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Note for TT&O Activites:  Every Project Team is required to spend at least 5% of ARPA-E funding on TT&O activities to promote and further the development and deployment of ARPA-E-funded technologies.  All budget activities must relate to achieving specific objectives, Technical Milestones and Deliverables outlined in the Statement of Project Objectives.  Applicants must list TT&O costs with a clear description of what activities are to take place (e.g. travel to the Annual ARPA-E Innovation Summit, work devoted to a commercialization plan, etc.).  

Only TT&O costs that relate to a specific technology funded by ARPA-E will be allowed, if the costs are allowable in accordance with Federal cost principles.  For TT&O activities aimed at advancing a portfolio of technologies and/or products owned by the Recipient or Project Partner, only the portion of costs specifically attributable to advancing the ARPA-E funded technology will be reimbursed.  Applicants are required to certify in the Full Application that they have met the 5% requirement for TT&O expenditures in their SF-424A and Budget Justification unless they submit an accompanying waiver request.  Applicants may seek a waiver of the TT&O requirement in whole or in part by including an explicit request in their Full Application.  In their request, Applicants must describe the proposed technology’s stage of development (i.e., early-stage or late-stage) with reference to Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  In addition, Applicants must describe in detail why the TT&O requirement should not be applied to their project or why they are proposing less than the required 5%.
 
Note for Patent Costs:  ARPA-E will reimburse up to $15,000 in expenditures incurred under the funding agreement for costs and fees relating to the filing and prosecution of U.S. patent applications on subject inventions disclosed to ARPA-E and DOE in accordance with Attachment 2 to the funding agreement (http://arpa-e.energy.gov/FundingAgreements/CooperativeAgreements.aspx).  Prime Recipients may use costs and fees in excess of $15,000 to meet their cost share obligations under the funding agreement.  

ARPA-E will not reimburse any costs and fees relating to the filing and prosecution of foreign patent applications on subject inventions disclosed to ARPA-E and DOE in accordance with Attachment 2 to the funding agreement.  However, Prime Recipients may use such costs and fees to meet their cost share obligations. 
For examples of allowable patent costs, please see Section IV.G.3 of the FOA.

Additional Explanations/Comments (as necessary)											
"Halotechnics has a provisional indirect rate from its existing DOE award (No. DE-FG36-08GO18144, Golden Field Office). However projected indirect rates are expected to drop versus 2010 incurred costs due to higher direct labor costs. The indirect rate in this proposal is estimated from historical costs from January to May 2011. The historical costs were adjusted to account for the expected change in cost structure if the award is received. One contractor working at Halotechnics has been hired full time and his projected wages are included in the direct labor pool. Total direct labor is used as a base. Indirect cost pool includes fringe costs and allowable overhead costs. 
Total overhead pool = $99,201
Total direct labor pool = $124,054
$99,201/$124,054 = 80%
