PROJECT TITLE (250 characters or less)

Principal Investigator, Lead Organization (City, State)

1. OVERVIEW
ARPA-E Contact:	Enter the name of any ARPA-E contact spoken to about the proposed concept prior to applying (if any).

Technical Subcategory:	Enter the most relevant technical subcategory for the proposed concept from those given in Table 1, Section I.D of the FOA (e.g., a battery concept would be “3.4 Chemical-Electrical”). Select the only one technical subcategory, even if the proposed topic falls within multiple categories. 

Funding Request:	Enter the funding request in U.S. dollars (no more than $500,000).

Project Duration:	Enter the project duration in months (no longer than 12 months).

Project Abstract:	Write brief abstract (1-3 sentences, 4000 characters or less) that describes the proposed concept, the problem that it solves, and the impact it could have on energy.

2. IMPACT
*	What is the current U.S. energy problem this concept will address? 
*	If this concept is successful, will it matter? Quantify how this concept will make a positive impact on at least one of ARPA-E’s Mission Areas (see Section I.A of the solicitation).

3. STATE OF THE ART
*	What solution is practiced today? What other competing technologies are being developed? 
*	Why is the current technology insufficient or undesirable?

4. INNOVATION
*	What is the new idea or information that will be obtained?
*	How does it work? Describe in detail how the new concept works, with no jargon. Use a diagram if appropriate. 
*	Has this concept been tried before? If so, what new developments will enable a working concept or overcome past failures?
*	If successful, how would the proposed technology/work advance the state of the art? To the extent possible, provide quantitative metrics in a table that compares the proposed technology to commercial and other competing technologies.

5. RISKS AND CHALLENGES
*	What makes the proposed technology/work a significant challenge? What are the technical risks for the proposed concept?
*	Does the approach require one or more entirely new innovations to be successful? (e.g.; a never-before demonstrated fabrication technique, greater-than-previously-shown subcomponent performance, or material property for a yet-unknown material).
*	What techno-economic challenges must the proposed technology overcome to be relevant in the marketplace? 

6. PROJECT PLAN
*	What will be accomplished by the end of the project? What are the objectives and performance characteristics of the proposed effort? Indicate the technical goals and anticipated results using appropriate metrics for the project.
*	What work will be associated with the proposed effort? (e.g.; algorithm development, prototyping, modeling and simulation, architecture definition, study, etc.).

7. TEAM
*	What organizations will be involved with the proposed effort and what will each contribute?
*	Who are the key team members on the proposed effort? For each key team member, include their name, position, institution, and 1-2 sentences about the skills or experience that make them ideally suited for the proposed effort.
