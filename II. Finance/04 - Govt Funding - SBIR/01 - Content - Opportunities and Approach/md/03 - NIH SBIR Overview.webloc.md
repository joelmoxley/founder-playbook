 What are SBIR and STTR Programs?
The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America’s Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs allow US-owned and operated small businesses to engage in federal research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization.

In Fiscal Year 2016, NIH’s SBIR and STTR programs will invest over 870 million dollars into health and life science companies that are creating innovative technologies that align with NIH’s mission to improve health and save lives. A key objective is to translate promising technologies to the private sector and enable life-saving innovations to reach consumer markets.

We invite you to explore our website to learn more about NIH's SBIR & STTR programs, or get started on an application!

SBIR
The NIH SBIR program funds early stage small businesses that are seeking to commercialize innovative biomedical technologies. This competitive program helps small businesses participate in federal research and development, develop life-saving technologies, and create jobs.

STTR
The NIH STTR program is similar to the NIH SBIR program, but requires that the small business formally collaborate with a research institution in Phase I and Phase II. Learn more about the NIH SBIR and STTR programs, including their critical differences.
