SBIR / STTR America's Seed Fund

The NSF Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program seeks to transform scientific discovery into societal and economic benefit by catalyzing private sector commercialization of technological innovations. The program increases the incentive and opportunity for startups and small businesses to undertake cutting-edge, high-quality scientific research and development.

We provide grants in phases: a proof-of-concept / feasibility grant (6-12 months, $225k) can potentially be followed by a longer development grant (2 years, $750k).

Catalyzing Commercialization at Startups & Small Businesses
The NSF SBIR/STTR program seeks to assist early-stage companies with innovative technologies that require additional research and development in order to advance commercialization. You can think of an SBIR/STTR grant as angel funding, except it is non-dilutive and federally funded. Click here to find out if your company is a good fit.

The NSF SBIR/STTR program welcomes proposals for research and development in all areas of engineering and science and related education. Click here to view all technology topic areas for the upcoming submission.

The NSF SBIR/STTR proposal submission deadlines are generally in early June and December. Online submission resources include a YouTube channel and a preparation booklet that provides a detailed step-by-step guide to assist applicants through the Phase I proposal submission process. Before submitting a proposal, first-time applicants must register at the New Organization and FastLane Contact Registration website.
