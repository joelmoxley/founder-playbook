Items of Interest

* SBIR 2017.2 BAA and STTR 2017.B BAA are now open for proposal submission.
* DoD BAA/Solicitation Changes: The Small Business Administration, through its SBIR/STTR Policy Directive, purposely departs from normal Government solicitation formats and requirements and authorizes agencies to simplify the SBIR/STTR award process and minimize the regulatory burden on small business. Therefore, consistent with the SBA Policy Directive, the Department of Defense is soliciting SBIR 16.3 and STTR 16.C as Broad Agency Announcements (BAA).
* SBA Reauthorization Implementation Policy – Congress has reauthorized the SBIR/STTR Programs through September 30, 2017. While this Reauthorization contains many changes, all DoD SBIR/STTR Programs will continue to follow the current SBIR and STTR Policy Directives (unless otherwise noted in the SBA Implementation Policy) until new policy directives are released by the SBA and the DoD develops policy to implement any changes.
