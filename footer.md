  # About the Founder's Playbook

  The Founder's Playbook was developed by Cyclotron Road and Moxley Holdings

  Cyclotron Road, along with the community of educational partners and practitioners
  below, will serve as a living laboratory for these resources, continually
  bulding upon and refining the content contained within based on their
  day-to-day engagement with leading hard tech innovators and entrepreneurs.
