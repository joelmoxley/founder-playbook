Perfecting Your Pitch

By Garage Technology Ventures

Endless articles,  books,  and  blogs  have  been  written  on  the  topic  of  business plan  presentations  and  pitching  to  investors.  In  spite  of  this  wealth  of  advice, almost every entrepreneur gets it wrong. Why? Because most guides to pitching your company miss the central point: The purpose of your pitch is to sell, not to teach. Your job is to excite, not to educate.
Pitching  is about  understanding  what  your  customer  (the  investor)  is most interested in, and developing a dialog that enables you to connect with the head, the heart, and the gut of the investor. If you want advice about pitching, you can ask a  venture  capitalist,  but  you  probably  won’t  get  a  very  good  answer.  Most VCs  are  analytic  types,  and so  they  will  give  you  a  laundry  list  of  topics you should  cover.  They  won’t  tell  you  what  really  floats  their  boat,  mainly  because they  themselves  can’t  articulate  it  in  useful  terms.  “I  know  it  when  I  see  it,”  is about the best answer you’ll get.What  is  the  investor  most  interested  in?  Contrary  to  popular  belief,  the  venture capitalist sitting at the other end of the table glaring inscrutably at the presenting entrepreneur  is not  thinking,  “Is  this  company  going  to  make  a  lot  of  money?” That is the simple question that most entrepreneurs think they are answering, but they  are  missing  the  crux  of  the  venture  capital  process.  What  the  investor  is really thinking is, “Is this company the best next investment for me and my fund?” That is a much more complex question, but that is what the entrepreneur has to answer.To win over the hearts and minds of investors, your pitch has to accomplish three things: 
Tell a good, clear, easy-to-repeat story—the story of an exciting new startup. Position your company as a perfect fit with other investments the investorshave made and their firm is chartered to make.Beat out the other investments the firm is currently considering. These latter two issues are beyond the scope of this modest guide. So for now, let’s just concentrate on telling a good story.
Tell a good storyMost of the articles on pitching are generally right about the topics, even if they miss the  nuance  (sell,  don’t  explain).  But  don’t  take  any  template  as  graven  in stone. Your story may require a moderate or even a dramatic variation on the list of slides below. You may need to explain the solution before you can explain the market; or if you are in a crowded space you may need to explain why you are different  than  everyone  else  early  on  in  the  conversation;  or  you  may  want  to drop  some  very  impressive  brand-name  customers  before  you  explain  your product or your market. The one thing you may not do is expand the number of slides  to  20  (or  30  or  50)!  Other  than  that,  let  the  specifics  of  your  situation dictate the flow of your slides.Nevertheless, it is useful to have a guide. With the caveats above in mind, here is a basic outline for your pitch:Cover  Slide:  Company  name,  location,  tagline,  presenter’s  name  and  title.  If there are multiple team members participating in the pitch, put names on the next slide  instead.  Key  objective:  Everyone  in  the  room  should  know  the  basic  idea and  value  proposition  of  the  company,  including  the  target  market,  before  the next slide is shown. All the words should not be on this slide, but with one or two sentences orally, reinforcing and extending the tagline, everyone should have a foundation  for  what  is  to  come.  Cardinal  sin:  Launching  into  your  presentation with an investor at the table thinking, “I wonder what these guys do?” Intro  Slide:  Team.  The  three  or  four  key  players  in  the  company.  For  some reason,  everyone  puts  the  team  slide  at  the  end,  but  investors  almost  always want to know this at the beginning, and it is just common courtesy to make sure everyone is  introduced.  But  make  this  short,  crisp  and  relevant.  This  is  not  the time to share everyone's life story, or detail the resumes of all six members of the advisory board. Focus on a significant, relevant accomplishment for each person that identifies that person as a winner. In 10 to 15 seconds, you should be able to say  three  or  four  sentences  about  your  CTO  that  says everything  the  investors want  to  know  about  him  or  her  at that  moment.  Key  objective:  Investors  should be confident that there is a good credible core group of talent that believe in the company  and  can  execute  the  next  set  of  milestones.  One  of  those  milestones may be filling out the team, and so it is important to convey that the initial team knows how to attract great talent, as well as having great domain skills. If there is a gap in the team, address it explicitly, before investors have to ask about it.

Please do   not   interpret   our   exhortation   to   “sell”  as an   endorsement  of   hype, exaggeration,  misrepresentation,  spin,  or  lying.  The  best  salespeople  are credible and trustworthy. It is more important that investors trust you than that they understand every nuance of your business.Pitching  investors  is  different  than  pitching  customers.  If  you  have  a  sales presentation  for  customers,  do  not  think  you can  simply  modify  it  slightly  for pitching  to  VCs.  Start  from  scratch,  keeping  in  mind  with  every  slide  that  an investor has a very different perspective than a customer. You  don’t  have to  be “conservative,” but  you  do  have  to  be  realistic.  Almost every entrepreneur fails to be realistic about how long things take in the real world  (vs.  the  spreadsheet  world).  Whether  it’s  the  time  to  complete product development,  or  the  time  to  close  the  next  ten  sales,  entrepreneurs  are pathologically optimistic. As with your financials, find examples of comparable challenges addressed by other companies, and use that data in your model.Never  ever  put  so  much  text  on  a  page  that  the  investor  has  to  read  it. Everything should be short, content-rich bullets in a font large enough to read without  squinting.  The  words  are  simply  reinforcement  of  the  points  you  are making  orally.  Pictures,  graphs,  and  charts  should  be  uncluttered  and  make clear, compelling points. If they have to be deconstructed and explained piece by piece, you will lose focus and momentum.And  never  use  your  presentation  stack as  a  standalone  document.  It  is perfectly okay if it is not readable when you are not around. That’s the job of your executive summary or your business plan.A good pitch is very rare. It is so hard executing on everything else that has to be done to build a successful company, pitching often suffers. But the ability to pitch is a key indicator for investors—if the entrepreneur doesn’t know how to sell, how can he or she build a great company?At  Garage  Technology  Ventures,  we  appreciate  how  hard  you  have  worked  to get  to  where  you  are,  and  how  hard  you  have  worked  to  craft  your  investor presentation.  We  wish  we  could  work  with all  the  great  entrepreneurs  we  meet, but unfortunately we can’t. Please help us get to know you better by telling your story clearly and concisely.If you are looking for a guide to writing an executive summary, you can find our version online: “Writing a Compelling Executive Summary.”
