Our Strategy
BFV’s investment strategy is based on the hypothesis that population growth up to a peak of 11 to 12 billion people (vs. 7+ billion currently) will place a tremendous burden on resource availability for a growing earth population having increasing amounts of discretionary spending capability. All nations must have access to energy, food, and water free from threat of shortages and, with minimal impact on the global environment and climate conditions.  
 
BFV applies supply chain and economics analytics (follow the product) to define the superordinate limitations in each market we address. BFV also applies both impactful and multidisciplinary technologies to transform the way people do things or think about things associated with making and selling products and services (follow the money). The outcome is to realize potential for growth, crisis resilience, and, strong returns. We believe that competently organized and executed multidisciplinary technologies are usually 4 times more likely to achieve disruptive outcomes by also changing the context, and the way we do things. An individual technology more often does not disrupt than does disrupt. When multidisciplinary technologies are combined, it is disruptive when the outcome results in new ways of making products, new businesses, or, services. 
 
All companies require strategic insight, enlightened leaders and capital. BFV leverages its founders’ extensive network of dynamic entrepreneurs, thought leaders, researchers in emerging technologies, and industrial infrastructure. We also engage with influential investors and project finance professionals to enhance the knowledge base, contacts, and business insights of our portfolio company innovators and entrepreneurs. 

Supporting the innovation revolution that matters
