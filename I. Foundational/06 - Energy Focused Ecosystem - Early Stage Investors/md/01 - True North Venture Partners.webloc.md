TRUE NORTH VENTURE PARTNERS

True North Venture Partners invests in and supports early stage businesses that have the potential to transform, expand and lead global industries. We are focused on industries such as energy, water, agriculture and waste, where the need for disruptive innovation is great and the challenges faced by entrepreneurs are daunting. Our goal is to identify exceptionally talented entrepreneurs with the vision, drive and business potential to significantly improve the world and help them realize their dreams by providing capital and expertise.

MORE THAN JUST CAPITAL

We are an early stage venture capital company founded by Mike Ahearn, who guided First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) from start up to an S&P 500 company and a global leader in the solar energy industry. We are backed by a small group of families who themselves have started and scaled leading global businesses and who are aligned with our mission.

We are building a team of partners, associates and advisors that combines investment experience with proven track records in developing start-up businesses into leading enterprises and successfully navigating the obstacles entrepreneurs face in fundamentally transforming global industries.

PARTNERS FOR THE LONG TERM

We seek to partner with entrepreneurs interested in building businesses that create fundamental economic value, stand the test of time, and most importantly have the potential to make significant and transformative contributions to the world.

We are structured to invest early in the life cycle of a business and to continue to invest in and support a successful business over time. We do not plan for liquidity events in assessing investments and our decision making after we make an initial investment is aimed at helping entrepreneurs build fundamental value rather than at generating liquidity events.
