Reliable, Affordable Energy for the World

Investing in a Carbonless Future
A future of emission-free innovation
By the middle of the century, the world will use twice as much energy as we do today, much of it in places that have never had access to power before. And that’s a great thing: the more access to energy people have, the larger our economies grow and the better our lives become.

But to get there, we need different tools than the ones that have served us in the past. Breakthrough Energy is committed to investing in new technologies to find better, more efficient and cheaper energy sources. The global energy market is massive, and finding a way to open it up is an investment opportunity worth getting right.

Breakthrough Energy Coalition
The Breakthrough Energy Coalition is a partnership committed to broad investment in new energy technologies. We are investing our own capital and are working with over 20 countries around the world who have committed to significantly increase their investments in the basic research that leads to breakthrough innovations.
ABOUT THE COALITION
Breakthrough Energy Ventures
Breakthrough Energy Ventures is a group of investors who have chosen to work together in a new investment fund that is patient, flexible, and committed to the guiding principles of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition.
ABOUT THE FUND
The Landscape of Innovation
To provide reliable and affordable power without contributing to climate change we need to address emissions in five key areas: electricity, transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, and buildings. We have mapped out a landscape of innovation that we believe will help humanity meet those challenges.
