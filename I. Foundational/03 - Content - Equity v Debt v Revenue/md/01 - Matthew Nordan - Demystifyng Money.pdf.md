What’s a convertible note?
* Used when a valuation is impossible to agree on
* A convertible note is a loan (with interest)…
* …that converts into shares the next time that money is raised with a valuation attached
* Example
  * Jan 2012: I write you a $100k note @ 10% interest
  * Jan 2013: You raise $2.2MM (including my note) which buys half the company ($4.4MM valuation)
  * My note converts into stock worth ($110k / $4.4MM) = 2.5% of the company
