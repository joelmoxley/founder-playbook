D. School Bootcamp Bootleg

Check this out - it's the d.school bootcamp bootleg.

The bootleg is a working document that captures some of the teaching we impart in "design thinking bootcamp", our introductory course, so that you can go try it out in the world for yourself. The guide outlines each mode of a human-centered design process, and describes a number of methods which may support your design thinking throughout the process. These process modes and methods provide a tangible toolkit which support the seven d.mindsets - shown on the following page - which we feel are vital attitudes for a design thinker to hold.
We have collected the methods presented in this guide from a wide range of people and organizations who have helped us build the content we use to impart design thinking. Think of this guide as a curation of the work of many individuals, who hail both from the d.school and also from other far-reaching areas of the design world. We are continuing to think about the challenge of referencing collectively developed content and acknowledging individuals' efforts to create that content. For now, in place of a proper solution, we thank all the people who have contributed to the methods collected in this guide. We welcome your reactions to this bootleg edition, and invite you to share the stories of how you use it in the field. Let us know what you find useful, and what methods you'd suggest we add, along the way.
Cheers,
d.school teaching team
