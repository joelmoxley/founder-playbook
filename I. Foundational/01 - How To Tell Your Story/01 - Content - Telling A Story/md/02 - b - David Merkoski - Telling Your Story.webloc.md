Telling Your Story: Effective Presentation Techniques [ARPA-E University]

Thanks for having me Adam and all the folks at arpa-e. it was great to do this talk earlier this year. it's great to give it again with some updates and changes and also to have knack for you with me here from ride pal to put it into practice and talk about how we use some of the exercises around storytelling and give you a little bit more sort of credibility in detail about how those how those function.
this talk is about telling your story and so I'm going to assume the most of the folks here the participants on the line have a story to tell or maybe you just want to be told a good story and that's why you're here. so either way I'm going to start by actually telling someone else's story this was the story told by my four-year-old when looks like this, he's the one there on the left, so there's a very early moment in storytelling istory. and here's this story once upon a time the end and it made us all laugh. and it made me laugh in particular because it kind of discovered an essential feature of stories at that age which is they have frames. all stories are framed. how do we learn this? where do we learn this? 
you know we discover sounds and then words and language. and that's the path to discovering that there are these things called stories. and they have structured. and we're all familiar with the idea of a beginning, middle and end, but the real question I
 have is we all want to hear a story but how did we learn to tell them? well for most of us we learn to tell stories from listening to people who tell stories. that could be our parents, could be our grandparents, a teacher or a mentor. someone we either had to listen to or maybe wanted to listen to because at some point all of us have been captivated, spellbound, hooked by a story. and we learned to tell the story that is frame them just like they did. we copied and pasted their techniques without even knowing it, and that's what was going on with my four-year-old with once upon a time the end yet figured out that essential frame. so we want to have the same power we want to tell our own story.
the problem is today the most powerful storyteller isn't really even a person at all. in our Google+, blog, Yelp, wordpress, Facebook, tweeting lives, were under a tidal wave of stories. an unprecedented volume of new stories washes over us every single day. were over indexed in storytelling and storytellers. we have become to think that we are great storytellers because we see so many stories. so if you want to tell your story and if you're in this room and on this call that I think you do, then you're going to have to tell better stories and you're going to have to tell your stories better. so that's what I'm here to talk about is telling your stories.
I'm going to do this in 10 slides, followed by three techniques and then we'll talk about right pal, the case study.
ok so that was me telling you I'm going to tell you a story. that's stage A, that's sort of the Once Upon a Time moments, of the in a galaxy far far away. stage A of telling a story is tell them  you're going to tell a story. always start a story by telling them you're going to tell a story. it can take just a second. we could take longer too. for instance, here's what my research is about. or my companies for work my company's vision for world domination, I'm glad you asked. it's a way to basically engage your audience before you actually tell your story. you want to create space for that story to take place. you want to create that frame. you want to make it clear that there is in fact a frame before you talk about what's inside that frame. you want to signal you're going to tell that story. Something like dimming the lights in a movie theater or turning up the music at a concert. it allows your audience's imagination to open up and be somewhere else. so that's the first part about telling a story, stage A, tell them you're going to tell a story.
now let's talk about the actual story. you know a lot of people talk about things like unique value proposition or talking points or marketing messaging and and that's all very important stuff to understand, how to sort of tell your story particularly in a business context. but before we even get to any of that kind of stuff, the meat and potatoes, I want to talk about how you get there. how do you actually find what it is you want to tell your story about. and to do that we practice an exercise here at greenstart and my former company frogs called the hook. now remember when I said stories are these kind of incredibly important things people get hooked by, spellbound, entranced by. the hook is the actual sticky bit. it's the thing you kind of hang your hat on, the thing that your audience can grab onto. and to do that you need to find something that's real and tangible. because we live in a complex world of ideas and abstractions and processes, it's hard to find what the story is if there's nothing being said. so the book is an internal activity to identify the nouns and the verbs or the objects and the actions of your story. for those of you starting a business it could sound like the unique value proposition. but the point is it's not dressed up in pretty language. it can seem easy at first, you can look at this and say oh I totally know how to do that for my product, for my research, for my idea. when you actually go through the activity and exercise, we're going to ask not to talk about that in just a second, you'll find it's much harder than you first thought. because it's about words and again we're all such good storytellers we think we're all such good storytellers from seeing so many stories, that we get caught up in marketing and tag lines and branding. that is to say, things like adjectives and adverbs. so the important thing here is to focus on nouns and verbs.
let me take you to a couple examples and then we'll talk to Nat, get some examples from her about her process, of going through that and then we'll come back and talk about how you actually use the results of the hook. so the first example we're going to do is 9Nissan and in particular we're going to talk about their car the Nissan Leaf. here's their hook: drivers don't need gasoline. that's it, it doesn't get more complex than that. it's not cars don't need gas. it's not drivers don't need fuel. it's not keeping drivers away from gasoline. and most importantly, it's not saving the world or going green things, that you might see on advertisements, marketing slogans, websites, etc, because remember this is an internal clarifying tool. it is not how you publicly tell your story. once you have your hook once you internally, as an organization or as a group or team, agree on what the nouns and the verbs, the basic option objects and actions are, then you can dress it up in a thousand different ways.
here's an example of that from Nissan: "what if everything ran on of gas? then again what if everything didn't? to 100% electric 0 gas nissan, the innovation for the planet innovation".
so that's a great example of breaking down the essence of what story you're trying to communicate first and then bringing it forward into something much more expressive. and we're going to talk about things like metaphor and analogy and repetition. all techniques is used in the actual telling of the story, after they first arrived at what the essential message is. 
let's do another example, you know I know a lot of folks on this call are very much on this road of scientific side, the research and development, looking at things at a very deep level that require an immense amount of understanding, to even begin to understand what the breakthroughs are that you're developing. another way of saying that is that science doesn't have to be uncool. and I kind of want to show an example around how to do the exact same trick of the hook, this internal exercise around something that might seem a whole lot more complex and show how inside even science and basic deep research lies the same process for being able to tell your story more simply and constructively to an audience. 
so here is a headline, an article from Reuters, explaining a new scientific breakthrough. one of the great things about scientific journalism is it does a really good job of finding the hook for you and often publishing it that way because they can't help but figure it out themselves. so this headline roughly is the hook: "nanotechnology turns plants into common plastic now". if you were actually in this research team and you have been plugging away at this effort for years, if you were these Dutch scientists and you had your breakthrough, you might actually arrive at the hook that sounds more like this: "ethylene and propylene nano particles of iron catalysts that synthesize oil based fuel alternatives". that's not a hook. while it is full of nouns and verbs, you've got to take out your Occam's razor you've got to make things simpler, because simpler explanations are better than complex ones. so another way of looking at this same exact basic research is "plants turning into plastics". now plants isn't technically right, plastic isn't technically right either, and turning into isn't technically right either. but this again is not about being technically right, it's about getting the story tight not right. and if you can understand how to look at your research and your work and see it through the eyes of an audience that doesn't have a depth and understanding of what you've been experiencing, then you'll have a much better time of going through this exercise of the hook. 
just to give you a couple more examples and then we'll turn over to Nat and talk about the process. here are some other companies, other brands give you a sense of what i mean by basic language and nouns and actions nouns and verbs. 
facebook, it's a website that keeps relationships. does it do far more than that? absolutely! is there a marketing language they've developed that pushes far beyond this emotionally? absolutely! but is this the essential action of the story that that nouns and verbs they would be telling about themselves? it is.
Pinterest, one of the reasons it's so successful as a website was it's a lot like Facebook and you could say it's a facebook for your favorite things and that's because it does essentially the same thing when you tell a story about it. it's a website to keep your favorite things. gatorades, a drink to replenish energy. virgin america, airplanes that fly with style.
you can imagine on these last two very brand strong, sorry, very strong brands, you go lots of adjectives, lots of marketing language to express the story and in fact these two brands do that quite often and quite well. but before they do they have to arrive at the essential hook that binds all their stories together.
so now I'm going to invite Nat for you, founder and CEO of RidePal, talk to me today about the case study that we went through here at Greenstart to develop her hook. Nat, welcome. thanks for joining. 
thanks for having me. 
so the first thing I'm gonna ask before we get into is just basically give people sort of the pitch the description of what ride pal is, so that we can kind of talk about how we got there.
you mean very original pitch or the pitch now?
the very original pitch.
okay so the very original pitch was actually geared toward commuters themself and it was about having a better life, having the ability to use their commute time to themselves 
and maybe for the folks in the calls its more a description of what the company does 
and so the way right now was doing this was the same, even if you don't work at a large company like Google or Apple that have shuttles that are paid for by the company and they will carry you from home to work. right now I can provide the solution to you commuters because we can aggregate all of you commuters living from one place, arrange for a bus to pick you up from that one place near your home and take you to your workplace. and you all kind of work into any location 
so it's kind of like Google shuttle the way they work but now for everyone, all companies in all markets
correct 
cool 
and so talk to me about your original marketing language and sort of how you guys came to that on your own 
the way we came to this on our own was Regis by talking to people and just listening to their own problems. and like I said, we focused on the riders initially because we actually believed they were the one hurting most and it turns out that it wasn't necessarily true, and there were two components in this market, the companies and the riders. and riders were really telling us that what they didn't like about their commute was that it was a waste of time. they would spend a lot of time driving because there was no alternative and they couldn't do anything else while they were driving. and then the second thing that seemed to be most important to them was their quality of life was not very good. they felt tired, they felt stressed and most of it had to do with the fact that they were driving. so our marketing language was just saying, you know, these are your problems and RidePal can help you eliminate them.
cool. it's a very common approach right, you should identify what problems your audience has and then you tell a story in emotional language that draws that you are the solution to that problem. so now we're going to go through and we take a look at three iterations of the hook. and as I told you before it can seem like a simple process from the outset but it actually takes a lot of sort of mental grinding work to really get there. so the first one hook one talk to me about this.
so when we got to, you know, looking at the hook I think one thing that it forced us to do was to look at the actors our system because we were looking at the story from the riders' perspective and we also realized that these riders of these commuters had a relationship with our employers. and we probably could have done that before but because we were focusing only on one side of the problem we didn't get to that. and it's actually when we looked at the hook, one thing that, one question that came up is like who who is involved in that whole relationship those now just basic
15:14exactly know what order now right and
15:17initially when we just said the writers
15:19it just didn't seem right so this is
15:20actually when we started to do a lot
15:23more research like this hook process led
15:26us back to the marketplace and companies
15:29actually kind of first in terms of how
15:32much they were hurting and from their
15:35perspective meaning was getting in the
15:37way of hiring people and then keeping
15:40them so a first book actually completely
15:44left the riders out and use the very
15:49similar approach okay your company this
15:51is your problem so right that is a
15:52solution so we switch to the other side
15:54now and so then books to is interesting
15:56because now you're starting to try to
15:57balance the two by talking more about
15:59yourself exactly so what the the next
16:03general when we looked at this first row
16:05of like always we the way we're testing
16:07it was talking to everyone in the
16:09company that well does that represent
16:11what we do is that the problem that
16:13we're married to and and there was
16:17something there that was in settings
16:19because the first book was about writers
16:21that they can hook was about company so
16:22obviously the first comment
16:23yet from everyone at the company was
16:25like what about the writers now so that
16:28second who doesn't seem complete and so
16:32we've the challenges okay how do we
16:34marry the two and we said well the only
16:36one thing in the middle between the two
16:38is the company so let's talk about the
16:41company so next book was what do we do
16:44and what we do is just we take care of
16:47all of you know the commuting things
16:50that need to happen for companies to
16:52attract talent and commuters to live a
16:53better life so will be the program
16:55management for community right on there
16:57was a mixup and then hook 3 you sort of
17:01came back around so hook 3 we came back
17:07around and the reason for that was its
17:11again know what is so first of all let
17:14me step back we realized that really
17:16though it wasn't about the company the
17:19hook is about really the a problem or
17:22something that the company is really
17:24trying to do the hook was not a
17:27statement of identity of the company it
17:30was really a statement of the what the
17:32company was about the story you're
17:34trying to tell ya so we went away from
17:37the second hook and then we go to get
17:39well what is these other relationships
17:41that exist between these commuters and
17:43the companies what is what makes that
17:46work what solves the problem for both
17:49writers and the company and that was
17:52basically what people didn't have today
17:54which was a commune experience it could
17:55love that's right end of four witches so
17:57that was Odin is happy the next hook and
18:00then that leads us into something we'll
18:01talk about after this case study which
18:03is the power of metaphor because once
18:05you find a hook that works for you the
18:08real power of course is how you spin
18:10that into a story how you dress that up
18:12in marketing language and a great way to
18:14do that is to sort of think about
18:15metaphors and analogies to the kind of
18:18story you're trying to tell so talk to
18:20me about this moment that you had so
18:22this was actually part of the exercise
18:24that was very helpful because we're
18:26talking about marketing language we did
18:28pick one side even though the hope was
18:30marrying the two sides when we were
18:33addressing the marketplace when
18:36to dig an audience and talking to a
18:38company is a different conversation and
18:41talking to the writers so we as related
18:43the company part and the way we went
18:47about this was just searching for images
18:49and so we just entered some terms from
18:54the hook for the for the company so we
18:56actually went back to one of our
18:57previous hopes that was still very
18:59useful to us and we put you know
19:02attractive we put something around
19:06talent and we had a bunch of images that
19:10came up and then we're just steps next
19:13to these images and there's ok what
19:14seems to be the one that just you know
19:17seems to embody bath what is that we're
19:18trying to do and the one that really
19:21came out with like ultimately these
19:23companies need to retain this talent to
19:25stand out there competing in the
19:28marketplace of hiring and they need to
19:30stand out so they need something that
19:32makes them stand out and what a good
19:34benefit does and so that's what the
19:36image steps that came back was ok there
19:38is one flower in a field of seemingly
19:42identical flower that has to be the
19:45flower that was working with right now
19:46and so that's how we came up with that
19:49marketing language yes and it's
19:51entertainment there's no this image is
19:53metaphoric powerfully led to this idea
19:55of attracting right and that's the sort
19:58of unique flower and so and extracting
20:00was also then that you know we were
20:03looking for the definition of that
20:04relationship between the company and the
20:06writers and that is I think where we
20:09found out what that real relationship is
20:11right and so now the hook begins to
20:12mature into truly the public-facing
20:14marketing language and this is the first
20:16sort of step at that we provide hassle
20:18free world-class commuting services blah
20:21blah blah begin the main point here is
20:22adjectives are now being inserted words
20:24are becoming more dressed up it's not
20:26just basic nouns and actions now we're
20:28starting to get into it and this is a
20:31great the simplicity moment right is
20:33taking something as complex as that
20:34statement and essentially boiling it
20:36down and keeping the essence of what you
20:38discovered in that book into this
20:40recruit and retain the best talent it
20:42says nothing about shuttle buses nothing
20:45about transportation it's a message
20:47that both sides can resonate with
20:49particularly the company side and then
20:52what I love is ultimately where I can go
20:53right which is connecting bunch with
20:55seats which is a line that i think if i
20:57remember correctly sort of just
20:58generally used in the transportation
21:00industry is kind of like a joke is that
21:02right the bus we see putting busking to
21:05seek is a is a fish ille terminology in
21:08the transportation industry connecting
21:10bus we states was not used freitas
21:12exactly and so there is that attract
21:14there is that recruit and retain even
21:16boil down simpler and is just a basic
21:18word like connect but receipts and so
21:20it's possible to come back all the way
21:22from women to go backwards real quick
21:23here from reclaim your commute time for
21:26yourself and live a happier fill their
21:27life something which you know doesn't
21:29really say that much to something that
21:31we connect two bucket seats so much
21:33province's at playfulness of the brand
21:35as it was developing and it becomes more
21:37akin to what you've discovered in the
21:39hook which is the essential story that
21:40you're trying to tell that's right cool
21:43thank you so much that for your time for
21:44the case study well you know once you
21:46get this hooked down and you begin to
21:48express it into language the in
21:52marketing language in particular there
21:54are a couple techniques that you can use
21:55but i really want to focus on two to
21:58make sure that your story is stronger
22:01than just having a good line and that's
22:03one of those is repetition you know the
22:05great thing about repetition is
22:07repeating things accelerates their
22:09essence and i can't stress that point
22:11enough so i'll say it again repeating
22:12things accelerates their essence it's a
22:15way to tell the signal from the noise
22:16think about the I have a dream speech
22:18right you you keep hearing the refrain
22:20you keep hearing I have a dream might
22:22have a dream you know the it that you
22:25want to repeat again and again is the
22:27hook but again that's a private internal
22:30activities which is trying to get you as
22:32a way of dressing that thing up and so
22:34we've talked about a little bit here but
22:35what I want to talk about now is how do
22:37you get it to become a story how do you
22:39actually get take the essence of the
22:41idea the hook that you've developed and
22:43turn it into a story well story is the
22:46deep structure of being and I use the
22:48capital be there intentionally it's
22:50actually from heidegger's a little bit
22:51of a philosophy moment here but in being
22:53in time tiger says what is the being
22:56that will give access to the question of
22:58the meaning of being and I have no idea
23:00what
23:01that means and his answer of course is
23:02it can only be that being for whom the
23:04question of being is important to being
23:05of whom beating being matters the point
23:08is trying to make here is that stories
23:10are the deep structure it's how we hold
23:13on to the world it's an hour confusion
23:15in our dread of being capital B in this
23:18world that we fight against the dark
23:20that we push against that wilderness we
23:22tell stories to stay alive to stay warm
23:24and safe it's what we do before we dream
23:27they're not abstractions they really are
23:29how we engage with the world and there
23:32are two very profound techniques that we
23:34have at our disposal to engage the world
23:37at this level with our stories the truly
23:40a motive and deep connection that we can
23:43forge over a story the first is analogy
23:47you know Douglas Hofstadter has a great
23:49line analogy is the core of cognition
23:53analogy this is like that one thing is
23:56logically like another in part the car
24:00is like a horse and that's a very
24:02logical argument basic building blocks
24:05of making a logical argument is to use
24:07an analogy but we are as much effective
24:11creatures as we are cognitive we are
24:13both head and heart and if you want to
24:16get to the level where story is that the
24:18deep structure of being you need to tell
24:20a good story to both and that's where
24:22metaphor comes in if analogy is this is
24:26like that logically then metaphor is
24:29this is that directly it's kind of
24:33almost like going from a laptop to an
24:35iPad where instead of tapping the
24:38buttons with a mouse and a keyboard at a
24:40distance you're doing it directly with
24:42your fingers metaphors or the iPads of
24:45storytelling so let me explain there's a
24:48conceptual theory of metaphor and it
24:50suggests that knowledge is structured
24:51around mappings in the brain derived
24:54directly from physical experience that
24:57is when I use a metaphor I'm not
24:59appealing to your head and your
25:02cognition but your actual sentence eight
25:04abilities of touching smelling seeing
25:06things like that now there have been two
25:08camps on this one says when you hear a
25:11metaphor like I've had a rough day you
25:13only under
25:14Stan me because you've heard that
25:15metaphor so many times and you've
25:17learned that rough means abrasive and
25:19bad and so your brain is toggling
25:22quickly from one definition to the other
25:24the other camp says the brain calls on
25:28sensory experiences that it has stored
25:30such as what roughness actually feels
25:33like to understand the meaning of the
25:35metaphor now recent functional MRI
25:38studies on metaphors of texture and
25:39touch suggest that the right turn of
25:42phrase the right metaphor does in fact
25:44activate the brains sensory centers the
25:47researchers scan subjects brains as they
25:49listen to textual textual textural
25:51metaphors and their literal counterpart
25:53so he's wet behind the ears versus he's
25:56naive it was a hairy situation versus it
26:00was a challenging situation now both lit
26:03up the language processing centers of
26:04the brain right because we are hearing
26:06language and processing it but metaphor
26:08is also activated the regions of the
26:10brain involved in textures and touch and
26:12the same part of the brain does not
26:14light up when you listen to the literal
26:16versions so next time someone says
26:19PowerPoint is just words and pictures
26:20you can now also tell them it's touch
26:22texture if you use metaphors I mean it's
26:26pretty awesome if you think about it
26:27storytelling becomes a physical process
26:29like sticking your fingers into
26:31someone's brain and massaging their
26:33thoughts out and the best kind of
26:35massage that I have discovered is
26:37provocation and the best kinds of
26:40stories are provocations like I have a
26:43dream or most of the things that Steve
26:46Jobs famous for doing on as keynotes
26:48you're moving back and forth between two
26:50messages what is versus what if and
26:54that's just the position that difference
26:57between those two is causing you to try
27:00to resolve the answer to what is versus
27:04what if like a picture like this try to
27:07suggest what could be even if it's not
27:10actually possible so that storytelling
27:14in a way of thinking about it from
27:17deriving your basic hook your basic idea
27:20and then dressing it up in the language
27:23of either an analogy or more powerfully
27:25a metaphor to both
27:28head and heart effectively and
27:30cognitively communicate the idea that
27:33you came up with during the hook now to
27:36end this presentation I want to talk
27:37about three quick tips that have more to
27:39do with the discourse of storytelling
27:41that is how you actually perform the
27:44story not what the content of the story
27:46is the first one is your script think
27:51about how many presentations are going
27:52on right now beyond this one in schools
27:54laboratories clinics in Afghanistan in
27:56this building right now every one
27:58seemingly today uses some kind of visual
28:01aid or prop I don't know about your mom
28:03but mine didn't use PowerPoint but now
28:06my kids use PowerPoint it's important to
28:09understand presentation is both what
28:11happens on the screen and what comes out
28:13of your mouth that's the discourse now a
28:16lot of people write their script on the
28:17screen they confuse the map for the
28:19territory so here's your first tip don't
28:22do that don't write your script in
28:26PowerPoint write it in paper write it in
28:29a word processor write down the boss
28:31that you are trying to communicate first
28:32rather than trying to fit them into a
28:34template and even better for the people
28:36on this call who are very well practice
28:38whether in a research setting or a
28:40classroom setting of giving the same
28:42presentation again and again year after
28:44year to the same audience throw away
28:46that presentation start fresh with a
28:49script and think about your idea from
28:52the hook activity perspective think
28:54about the basic nouns and verbs first
28:56derive your message and then move
28:59backwards into dressing it up and you
29:01might arrive at an incredibly different
29:03story to tell put your script in your
29:05mouth where it belongs and that is off
29:08screen not on screen the second is
29:11improvisation knowing your material
29:13isn't good enough you need to make it
29:15appear that you know your material but
29:17that you're not stiff that you can react
29:20in real time even if you are the only
29:22one presenting you know there's a
29:24there's a game that goes on in most
29:27cities worldwide section event called
29:30pecha kucha and if you've ever been to
29:32one you'll know what I'm talking about
29:34started in Japan it's in every major
29:36city in the world it means chit chat and
29:38all it is is 20 images for 20 seconds
29:41long and then you have
29:42present click open mic night for
29:44presentations one great example or its
29:46or one great tip i can give you all is
29:48look for that in your city and and it's
29:50like that open mic night it's a little
29:52nerve-wracking but try it out go on
29:54stage with whatever your presentation is
29:5620 images 20 seconds long for each image
29:59and try to give your talk to a very
30:01willing audience they'll give you great
30:02feedback and it allows you to improvise
30:04and learn the art of telling your story
30:06without sticking to your script and
30:09finally the last tip is three three is
30:12the magic number really it is and you
30:14should use it and when you're in doubt
30:15about how many things to name or list or
30:17choose on a slide it's three and why
30:20well because we have so much tied up in
30:22three beginning middle and thesis
30:25antithesis synthesis setups conflict
30:28resolution love triangles we expect
30:31three you should deliver on three it's
30:34what people are expecting course the
30:36great thing about three that you can
30:37then break it once you set it and so
30:39I'll say one more thing for tips and
30:41that is this idea of battle decks
30:43probably we did actually at arpa-e I
30:45think with great success very hard to
30:47explain on the phone much better to live
30:49it and feel it but what I can recommend
30:52is get a friend put together five images
30:55in a PowerPoint deck that you've never
30:57seen before and then give yourself two
31:01minutes in the mirror in a camcorder or
31:03two that friend to try to pitch or give
31:06a presentation or tell a story to those
31:09five images that you've never seen
31:11before the better that you can map what
31:14you're telling to the random images that
31:16are put on screen the more connected
31:18fluid and improvisational you will be
31:20with your story it's another rehearsing
31:23technique like improvisation only it's
31:25even stronger because it makes you
31:27realize how on or off message you are at
31:30any given moment depending on the
31:32circumstances so those are the three
31:35tips really for and that was me telling
31:38the story part b of the overall
31:41structure of how to tell a story I
31:42opened up by telling you I'm going to
31:44tell a story I then told you a story in
31:46this case about storytelling and now I'm
31:48going to do the thing you need to do to
31:50end the story to complete the frame of
31:53the story and that's to tell you I just
31:55told you is
31:56you know my story because it's a story
31:58also has a structure and therefore also
32:00had a book and my basic nouns and verbs
32:03were story telling to an audience that's
32:06you I told you how to tell stories
32:08better I told you how to tell better
32:10stories things like analogies metaphors
32:12repetition provocation in the hook and
32:14so now it's time to raise the lights
32:16turn off the music finish the frame to
32:19close the story and bring it to an end
32:23because unlike once upon a time the end
32:26is the hardest part of telling a story
32:28you've got your audience to open up
32:31their minds to engage emotionally with
32:33you on the story they've believed
32:35ideally what it is you were trying to
32:37tell them and now you actually have to
32:40tell them it's over you have to make the
32:42magic go away and for most of the time
32:44nothing is final we're always kind of in
32:47the middle that's why closure so hard
32:49the project keep going the research
32:51keeps going the presentation may end but
32:54the conversation keeps going and with
32:56that I'll end on this presentation and
32:59turn the floor back over to our PE and I
33:02think Adam were along and ask if there's
33:04any questions that i can answer about
33:06this process the hook or otherwise great
33:10well thank you very much David and I
33:13really appreciate it as well Nats
33:16contribution and hearing her experience
33:18we do we have a fair number of folks on
33:20the line so if you've got your WebEx
33:23browser there look for the Q&A box
33:25notably not not the chat box with a Q&A
33:29box and you can put some questions and
33:34David if you see that box there they
33:37should they should come in beige well
33:39what I was I gonna get off I'm sorry
33:43sorry yeah I got it up soon okay and but
33:48I'd like to start off this bike doing a
33:49couple things first off we had someone
33:51ask how did you how do you spell the
33:53pecha kucha or or maybe that's something
33:56that a bad spelling into Google can help
33:59us
33:59synthesized but I wanted to know about
34:02that yeah let me let me go ahead and
34:04make sure I get the correct spelling and
34:06i'll just type it into the Xu and a
34:08window there for everybody okay it's PE
34:14ch a que ucha and I can't send it in the
34:23Q&A window guess I can't ask myself a
34:25Q&A for the problem here you could oh
34:27wow you can put it into the chat yeah
34:29I'll put into the chat okay it will also
34:32send that around to everyone that's on
34:34the line as well and I wanted to ask I'm
34:38sorry I was going to happen to you I'll
34:41also add the URL in there as well so
34:42people can see which city is closest to
34:44them thank you perfect okay there we go
34:48so one question was thinking about the
34:55Viet essence of the story and talking
34:59about the what is versus the what is and
35:00what that struck me as something for
35:02particularly people who are working on
35:04it's something that might be pretty
35:05esoteric it might be a power electronic
35:08component that is is not something
35:12easily understood you know we have
35:13people especially here at our PE but but
35:16throughout the energy technology
35:17landscape that are working on a part of
35:18a balance of system but I just wanted to
35:21see especially in your experience I know
35:23three start made a transition from
35:26focusing on one portion of the energy
35:29technology world to another but if you
35:31had maybe just an experience with
35:33someone that sort of that struck me the
35:36idea of talking about so what is versus
35:39of what it could even really help
35:40something that at first you know seem
35:43like a very small component of a larger
35:45system to kind of bring out its
35:47magnitude in this impact yeah and
35:50there's a great presentation online at a
35:54TED conference by a woman named Nancy
35:56Duarte dua arte in which she went
36:01through and analyzed great speeches in
36:04history like Martin Luther King's I have
36:06a dream like Steve Jobs keynotes and
36:08many others that were familiar with
36:10specifically on the idea of provocation
36:14and and what you realize in her mapping
36:18is that what provocation is doing is
36:21something very similar to what we see in
36:24in preaching in motivational speaking
36:27and coaching which is generally to whip
36:29your audience up into a frenzy by
36:33constantly balancing in time the
36:36differences between what is and what
36:38could be so if you think about it what
36:41we're all engaged in particularly the
36:43audience to folks that the member that
36:44you just mentioned is we are trying to
36:47design solutions to problems right we
36:51have identified that there is a problem
36:52in the world and we are trying to design
36:54the solution for it dieter Elms bring
36:57designer once said design is an argument
37:00about the future and I think that's what
37:03provocation is most sort of credibly
37:06identified as is it's an argument about
37:08what could be and so when you're trying
37:12to express in a story what it is your
37:15solution to the problem that you've
37:17identified with you've identified then
37:20casting that as a provocation by saying
37:23not just what it is that I'm doing and
37:26here's its solution to the problem but
37:28what it is that I'm doing could lead to
37:30this kind of future it could be this
37:33kind of world that we live in I know the
37:36image that I showed there you could
37:38imagine what it would be like if we can
37:40all control our cars big and small alike
37:43by remote control now I could just focus
37:46on the idea if I was maybe the engineer
37:48behind that project i've created a
37:50wireless frequency modulator chip that
37:52allows me to insert it into any
37:54transportation it's like but then that's
37:56not really a story that's just basically
37:59describing the solution to the problem
38:01by casting your solution in context to
38:04the world we could be living in the
38:07argument for the future you'll much more
38:09likely engage your audience with the
38:12problem that you are solving and more
38:14specifically your solution because now
38:16they can grasp it they can put it into
38:18their own mind and if you do that with
38:20metaphor better than analogy but either
38:23then you'll do that even more
38:24emotionally right you'll appeal to their
38:26heart as much as they're ahead in the
38:28future that you're talking about in the
38:30argument that you are designing you know
38:34and what strikes me about that is is
38:37what NAT said about her process she said
38:39you know we got out there and we talked
38:41to people and we listen to how they
38:44describe their own problems which is a
38:46little reminiscent for those folks that
38:48were here for seedlings presentation his
38:50big secret sauce for building your
38:53business model was to get out and talk
38:54to customers and so it sounds like you
38:56know maybe for that for the
38:58technologists in the lab that you might
39:01have a good handle on the the ins and
39:03outs of the scientific challenges that
39:05you're working on but you might be
39:07framing those in a way that the end user
39:09might not describe their problem in the
39:11same way and so as you're saying to
39:13connect to the head in the heart with
39:14analogy that would be I'm sure you have
39:18some inch I'm sure you're the green
39:19start the companies that work with green
39:22star has some pretty wild experiences
39:24going out talking to their customers
39:26yeah maybe tell us a little bit about
39:29about green start we had one question
39:31come in asking you to elaborate how
39:34green start helps our PE RP green start
39:38helps other technology companies so
39:41there's the the friendships between
39:43David and our PE is is that exactly as a
39:46friendship there's no official
39:47partnership but just to give folks a
39:50little bit of an idea of what green
39:51start does and then yeah sure great we
39:56there is a little bit of an official
39:58partnership only in that we are a on the
40:01on the sunshot on the ue SunShot program
40:03so you know kind of cousins to some
40:06degree but but what green starts job is
40:09is to focus on work with startups in the
40:13digital clean tech space and so that's
40:15just basically thinking about
40:16traditional clean tech as we all
40:18understand it but that uses software in
40:21some fashion right so it could be the
40:24central business model or innovation is
40:26software it could be the distribution
40:27mechanism is software but really
40:30interested in kind of thinking that what
40:32happened to let's say mobile and
40:35happening right now so retail and
40:36transportation and happen to media what
40:39digital technology did to those
40:40industries it's going to do in some
40:42fashion to the energy or clean tech
40:44industry so we work with startups who
40:47are practicing or have products and
40:49services in that space and our job is
40:51essentially to make them better by
40:54telling better stories having better
40:57brands that tell those stories and most
41:00critically helping them design the
41:02products and services themselves and so
41:05that's everything from a mobile phone
41:07app to we recently like ride pal the who
41:11just meant literally talking about what
41:13is that shuttle experience what is it
41:15like when you get on what does it look
41:17like at the sign at the stops what is
41:20the online ticket buying process like so
41:23it's the full experience of what a
41:26product or service experience could be
41:29plus as i said the brand and also the
41:32storytelling the pitch itself so it's
41:33really kind of a a workshop environment
41:35for startups in that space excellent um
41:4311 good question here is elaborating on
41:46how storytelling has changed or maybe
41:49changes depending on the communication
41:52tool you know and the person list a
41:54couple of different mediums in websites
41:56video podcasts and so I guess you
41:59especially with companies that sometimes
42:02you know today's presentation I think
42:04was focused on delivering it live you
42:07know the hook I guess process can feed
42:08into any different channel but any
42:12thoughts do you have on how the story
42:13should evolve as as you use different
42:16communication tools whether the websites
42:19video podcasts things like that
42:22absolutely I think it's really important
42:24to recognize that while your story will
42:27change depending upon the medium of its
42:30discourse that is to say whether it's
42:33PowerPoint or a movie or a forum like
42:36this which involves going to promote
42:37void the the two things are separate you
42:41really should try to understand what
42:44you're communicating as content or
42:47narrative and disk
42:49course right so there is the actual
42:51messages that you are trying to get
42:53across and the hook as one technique for
42:56doing that but then there is the actual
42:58discourse and all the kind of props that
43:00you use to tell that story and there is
43:03no best method in fact more often than
43:05not you're shoehorned into a discourse
43:08method right if you're talking to a
43:10venture capitalist they'll want to see a
43:1215 slide deck or something like that if
43:16you're in the elevator then all you have
43:17is a one minute conversation right so
43:20more often than not it's not about
43:22choosing the best medium to tell your
43:24story but trying to find a consistency
43:27across all the mediums and keep your
43:30narrative your content your story so to
43:32speak as similar as possible across all
43:36of those and so while it's true that
43:39images and video and visually rich
43:41mediums will be more successful at the
43:45aspect of the emotional storytelling
43:47quality the same is true you can be as
43:51effective and emotionally engaging with
43:54just your voice in your body language
43:55and have to say that's something which a
43:57lot of the startups who come to green
43:59start are very surprised to not learn
44:01but but actually experience and discover
44:03because at the end of our program we
44:06have a sort of big pitch day where they
44:08get in front of about 300 investors and
44:10so it's very much their body language
44:13and their confidence the tonality the
44:17amount of pacing where you put your
44:18hands when you're talking all of that is
44:21equivalent to the slide the images that
44:23you might use in PowerPoint and many of
44:26us still either too confident or unable
44:28to ask for coaching there for help from
44:30our friends or professionals around that
44:32that discourse side of storytelling but
44:35it is as important if you want to tell
44:37an effective emotional story as the
44:40images that you might use as well so for
44:43me I'd say there's a lot more work we
44:45can all be doing on that side of
44:46discourse and worrying about whether or
44:48not I've got the right template for this
44:50slide that I'm showing great now that
44:54that is it's really helpful and I think
44:57also just emphasizes what might be
45:00painful advice to hear which is just
45:03yes you know it is practice practice
45:06practice and as a result one thing I
45:09want them very clearly no there isn't
45:11any kind of magic to any of this it
45:13really is more of a confidence game and
45:15the way that you can get there is just
45:18ask people who you trust you are closest
45:20to you friends family colleagues to
45:23participate with you in these activities
45:25you can't develop the hook on your own
45:28you will be trapped in your own mind and
45:29use your own words ask your mom in
45:32Estill Eamon to look at the thing you've
45:35written basic nouns and verbs and see if
45:37they understand it ask ask your friend
45:40to suffer through a five minute pitch of
45:42yours with the battle deck images random
45:45images and you'll find that well it may
45:47not be in the best interest of their
45:48time it will remarkably increase your
45:51abilities but you need to reach out to
45:52these people and engage them though they
45:54may have no idea what you're doing in
45:56the practice of storytelling right right
46:00well and i think is well the point i
46:03just wanted to bring it up again that
46:04you had said you know you might be a
46:06career professor you've given lectures
46:09every day for 30 years but you might
46:13have been rehearsing to reach a
46:15different audience than that you're
46:16going to go reach whenever you need to
46:18sit in and present to whether it's
46:21venture capital or whether it's just
46:23another research team where you're
46:24trying to recruit a new partner for your
46:26project so not just practice but also
46:30recognizing the need that you might you
46:34might have already done some rehearsing
46:35but you might need to do some different
46:36type of rehearsing to be really
46:39effective yeah it's this I can say with
46:43certainty every startup that comes in to
46:45the program within the thing it's week
46:48one day one we throw those slides away
46:51and we may actually end up on the end of
46:55the program 90 days later we bring a lot
46:57of it if certainly not some of it back
46:59in it's just that you can't make
47:01progress on developing a new story or
47:04most quickly what you're talking about
47:06speaking to a new audience if you're
47:08using an old story that you've sort of
47:12built a battle sort of a wall
47:14around you feeling comfortable and safe
47:17that you know that material just because
47:19you feel confident and safe that you
47:20know the material doesn't mean you're
47:23achieving your goal of communicating
47:24that material successfully to all the
47:27audience's that might or need to know
47:29that material so the exercises of today
47:32the idea of reaching out to other people
47:34the tips that I shared all of those will
47:36help you essentially throw out your
47:37existing PowerPoint slides starts from
47:40scratch it's a hard process blank canvas
47:43but you know takes these exercises to
47:45heart go through them and you'll arrive
47:47back at something which means even if
47:49it's not the best new presentation I'm
47:51sure you'll find improvements for the
47:53one you're currently doing now we have
47:57interesting two different but related
47:59questions and both kind of about
48:02convention in presentations in the
48:04technology world one person is asking
48:07you know what should be the kind of the
48:09proficiency of the credentials of the
48:11person presenting if you have small team
48:13and you're going in because of the need
48:15is you've been talking about to connect
48:17with both the head in a heart should you
48:18put maybe you're both your best
48:19presenter to the most natural presenter
48:22forward versus someone who who is maybe
48:25the most expert at the technical
48:27material you're covering and someone a
48:29related question and answer either of
48:32them or or none of that a related
48:34question is you know saying like there's
48:37a lot of people advising at these
48:38conferences to just stay with a very
48:40strict you know focus on just the facts
48:43and that where there might be some
48:45concern about kind of looking like
48:47you're going rogue or you're maybe being
48:49catchy or following a sad and following
48:52this different approach so how would you
48:54kind of balance attention I guess where
48:55you know people want to be taken
48:57seriously and be seen as expert but at
49:00the same time as you're set advising
49:03having the ability to connect with you
49:06know words pictures and air with these
49:09things like that sure so i'll come back
49:12to the high degree line of stories are
49:15the deep structure of being there is not
49:18a single soul on this planet who does
49:20not want to hear a story it's what every
49:22child asks before they go to bed and
49:24it's why we turn the TV on we all want
49:27to hear a store
49:28we and we may use different language to
49:30say that we may say things like I want
49:32to understand your business plan or I
49:34want to understand what research
49:35breakthroughs you've achieved but
49:38fundamentally if you're going to engage
49:39in a conversation like that you are
49:43telling a story so the degree to which
49:46you kind of go rogue or go off script or
49:48try something out that's not traditional
49:51is only a factor of your confidence in
49:54delivering that discourse of the content
49:58that you have so what I would suggest is
50:01if you want to be different because you
50:04want to stand out okay you can do that
50:07but if you're not confident in your
50:10ability to do that if you've not
50:11practiced it and rehearsed it and dumb
50:13the exercises to test it against your
50:16various audiences then you will look
50:18like a bad story teller and it will
50:20backfire against you so it kind of
50:23follows along with the answers that I
50:25would give to the first question which
50:26is you always want your best storyteller
50:29to give the presentation the caveat
50:33being they need to be able to answer
50:36questions that its continued the story
50:39even after the frame of the story has
50:42been closed and so it's very convenient
50:45when you have a forum where there are no
50:47questions where it is not a conversation
50:49it is a one-way storytelling like TV is
50:52a great example of that and that's why
50:54they put the best storytellers on TV the
50:57actors and the writers themselves in a
50:59two-way experience where there's QA you
51:02just have to be mindful that you're sort
51:04of best hitter your best pitcher or
51:05whatever the best storyteller is not
51:08necessarily going to be the answer
51:09because they actually have to follow
51:11through with that story into all the
51:13details sort of the fractal edges of all
51:16possibilities that that story might
51:18create this provocations there's
51:20arguments that they might create in the
51:22minds of the audience so if you're
51:24feeling confident about your ability to
51:26tell stories go with it no matter what
51:28the format required because everybody
51:31wants a good story and if you've got a
51:33good storyteller on your team and they
51:36know the material enough to kind of
51:37handle the follow-up to the story then
51:39go with that person e
51:41they aren't dub so to speak first person
51:44the original person who has come up with
51:47the idea right set type title position
51:52on the team not necessarily as essential
51:54as having the ability to bring both of
51:56those to bear now we have another
51:58question here that I think also can ring
52:02through to anyone who's attended a
52:04conference but it's about links and an
52:07understanding you know what does I think
52:09every would be great if there was a
52:10proper you know rule of thumb in every
52:13case obviously it's situational but what
52:15would be your guidance on on people as
52:18they think about length so I think the
52:19average conference go over its day you
52:21know people's presentations are too long
52:23and they you know it's not just that
52:26they're putting the script on this page
52:28but that they're just trying to present
52:30too much information but you know with
52:32things that are in a technical as they
52:33are in the energy technology space how
52:35do you counsel people to hit that right
52:38balance yep there is no there is no
52:42number in the sense that one number is
52:44better than others i've done
52:45presentations of a hundred slides in
52:48five minutes and has done presentations
52:50with zero slides in an hour the real
52:54question that's kind of up for grabs
52:56though is how do you keep your audience
52:58engaged with you no matter what the time
53:01is you know there probably isn't upper
53:03boundary right I'm sure at some point
53:05after hours and hours you have to go to
53:07the bathroom but but what movies teach
53:09us is you can definitely go for about
53:11two hours three hours and engage an
53:13audience in a story so it's not that the
53:16upper boundary or you know minimum
53:18boundary is the issue it's what are the
53:20ways in which whatever story you're
53:22telling you keep people along for the
53:24ride with you and and one tip that sort
53:27of is thread throughout all of this
53:29material and I hope you picked up on and
53:31in specific I talked about with the idea
53:33of the number three which you saw
53:35repeated ad nauseam throughout my
53:36presentation is if you sell the
53:39structure your presentation and you give
53:42people clear demarcation points when you
53:45have begun one section and ended the
53:47prior they are more willing to follow
53:50along with you so you heard we often say
53:53things like I have
53:54slides and I'm going to go through those
53:56or I have three tips and i'm going to go
53:59through those every time i use that
54:01technique you are just that much more
54:03likely to follow along with me than not
54:06because you know that there is a finite
54:09end to what i'm doing but the trick that
54:11I'm pulling is that I'm constantly doing
54:13that and I could for hours if I'm a very
54:17good presenter and I quite sure I'm
54:18there yet I could keep streaming those
54:20tricks along saying I'm going to tell
54:23you this many things and when this many
54:25things come to pass I had then revealed
54:28the next many things and that kind of
54:30gating that kind of threshold of only
54:33revealing a certain amount of detail
54:35about what's to come in the future so
54:37that your audience patiently waits for
54:39that to happen it's a great way to keep
54:41that rhythm going of the presentation
54:44now that that doesn't absolve you from
54:46having to be engaging an evocative and
54:49emotional during the time you're
54:51actually doing those ten or three slides
54:54but that's a great technique to extend
54:56or to deal with the sort of length that
54:59you feel you have to get through without
55:01actually making it seem like it's an
55:03infinitude of hundreds of slides in a
55:05deck that has no beginning no middle and
55:08no end excellent know that that does
55:12that make sense and it's basically
55:14providing it in bite-size portions you
55:17know you don't need to stay call at once
55:18you get it cut it up yes that's right
55:22and think of it and think of those bytes
55:24as different sizes to write its it gets
55:27very boring if you say I'm going to do
55:29three things and then three comes to
55:30pass I'm going to do three things and
55:32three coats bass I'm going to do three
55:33they like that can seem in you know
55:35infinite as well so it's about varying
55:37those bite-sized portions small than
55:40large them small the medium you can
55:42actually change together those
55:44bite-sized pieces for quite a long time
55:48well did we really appreciate your
55:51presentation and sharing your thoughts
55:53with us today and I know that it's been
55:57really need to watch the coverage of
56:01start participants that you guys have
56:04had and I encouraged everyone on the
56:05phone if today was the first time that
56:07you've heard of green start you know
56:09check out their site and and check out
56:12what their what their companies and
56:14participants are doing I think that
56:17there's a lot that can be learned and we
56:19appreciate the openness data that you
56:21guys have had on some of the tools that
56:22you use the hook the battle decks oh I
56:25didn't want to mention to everyone if if
56:27you want to see the examples of some
56:30people trying out the battle deck
56:33practice tool we have the video of
56:35David's presentation from this loss
56:37februari in and some three very brave
56:40individuals who came up and gave that a
56:42shot you know again it's not i would say
56:45it's not often in the very cost
56:47intensive world of developing technology
56:49that you get a lot of free advice that
56:52you can go execute with your team with
56:55no startup costs so thanks again David
56:58for for your participation today it's
57:00great to have you thank you and i'll
57:02send you these slides right now so
57:03everyone on the phone would like them
