What is it?
The Berkeley Energy and Climate Institute (BECI) and Berkeley Energy and Resources Collaborative (BERC) are pleased to present the Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored “Berkeley Cleantech University Prize (CUP).”

Each fall, student teams from throughout the U.S. will apply to the Berkeley CUP. Selected teams will receive extensive cleantech mentorship, entrepreneurial training, and access to fabrication/prototyping spaces at UC Berkeley. Additionally, selected teams will benefit from the Competition’s dedicated mentors and educators; including world-class professionals from the Haas School of Business’s Cleantech to Market (C2M), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s (LBNL) Cyclotron Road, the American Jobs Project (AJP), the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) Foundry, the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology (SCET), SkyDeck and the BECI Energy Challenge.

After four months of mentorship and training, the selected student teams will compete for the $50,000 Berkeley CUP which will be awarded in conjunction with the annual BECI Philomathia Forum and BERC Energy Summit. Winning teams will advance to the DOE’s Cleantech University Prize National Conference hosted by Spark Clean Energy.
