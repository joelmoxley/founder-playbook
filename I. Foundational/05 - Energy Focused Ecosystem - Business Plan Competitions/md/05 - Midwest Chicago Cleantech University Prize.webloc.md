However, just 8-10 finalist teams will be selected to take part in a mini-accelerator, where they will have access to CET’s leading network of mentors, tailored curriculum, and our community of experienced innovators.

The winner of our final event – the Cleantech UP Showcase – will be determined by a panel of expert cleantech industry judges. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd place finishers will also go on to present at the Clean Energy Trust Challenge event – as well as the DoE National Cleantech UP competition.
