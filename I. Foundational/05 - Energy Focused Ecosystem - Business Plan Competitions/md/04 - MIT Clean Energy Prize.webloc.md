MIT Clean Energy Prize

The nation's oldest and largest clean energy entrepreneurship competition

The MIT Clean Energy Prize (CEP) is the oldest and largest student-run business plan competition in the US, with the mission to both INSPIRE and PREPARE the next generation of leaders to take on the world’s most pressing energy challenges.



INSPIRE

CEP utilizes its established partnership networks to host widely attended energy innovation events in major cleantech hubs across the US, including Boston, New York, San Francisco and Houston and will be worldwide for the first time for the 2017 edition. The programming brings together students, entrepreneurs, academics, and industry experts to begin identifying and addressing energy opportunities.

 

PREPARE

The official CEP competition launches in the spring with a robust two-month mentorship phase, where each team is coupled with a technology, business and legal mentor. CEP cumulates with the Grand Finals Showcase, where the refined teams compete for upwards of $200,000 in non-dilutive, equity-free funding in front of crowds reaching 500 people. 

“
“Winning the renewables track of the 2013 MIT Clean Energy Prize was life-changing for us - it was the first step in the transformation from a bunch of students with an exciting idea into a credible team that is now backed by brilliant angel investors and the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot Initiative. And for my co-founder Ido and me, at a time we chose not to pursue traditional job opportunities and graduated with student loans, the prize money was like oxygen for a newborn baby. We wouldn’t be where we are without the CEP. Period.”
— Senthil Balasubramanian, Co-Founder and Head of Product Innovation at Sistine Solar.
