LACI

The City’s cleantech business incubator
Los Angeles has launched its cleantech business incubator to accelerate development of cleantech start-ups by offering flexible office space, CEO coaching and mentoring, and access to a growing network of experts and capital. LACI is the business equivalent of baseball’s farm system: it identifies local talent, nurtures it, and helps it get to market, resulting in more jobs and a bigger green economy in Los Angeles.

“The study reinforces what we have known Los Angeles is capable of being:
a center for innovation and green job creation.”
-Mayor Villaraigosa, July 2011

A strategic imperative to build a green economy
The city’s primary economic growth strategy is to drive innovation in clean technologies. The Los Angeles region is already the largest green economy in the nation. There is an unprecedented economic opportunity as the country rebuilds its energy and transportation infrastructure, shifting energy dependence away from fossil fuels and toward sustainable energy sources.

A partnership among public, private, and educational sectors
LACI is a non-profit organization funded by the CRA/LA and the LADWP for the City of Los Angeles. In partnership with the city’s exceptional educational and research organizations – UCLA, USC, Caltech and Jet Propulsion Laboratory – LACI helps accelerate the commercialization of their clean technologies in addition to accelerating new products developed by independent entrepreneurs. LACI is a result of the Clean Tech Los Angeles (CTLA) alliance among the Mayor’s office, the City’s universities, the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, the Los Angeles Business Council, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, LADWP and the CRA/LA.

Located in the heart of the city’s Cleantech Corridor
LACI is located in the city’s Cleantech Corridor in downtown Los Angeles. Located in a four mile long strip between the Los Angeles River and Alameda in the eastern part of downtown, the Clean Tech Corridor is the cornerstone of the city’s green economy strategy. The Corridor will be home to the cleantech ecosystem that Los Angeles is building to support the green economy.

At the center of the Cleantech Corridor is the Arts and Innovation District, a vibrant neighborhood undergoing a dramatic change from abandoned warehouses to a mix of creative entrepreneurs and out-of-the-ordinary living spaces. LACI is located in the center of the Arts and Innovation District, within easy walking distance of SCI-Arc, restaurants, bars, galleries, Little Tokyo, and luxury lofts.
