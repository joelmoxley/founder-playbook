OUR VISION: TO BE THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO BUILD A CLEANTECH HARDWARE COMPANY

JOIN OUR COMMUNITY

OUR CHALLENGE
The rapidly growing global population and the increasing demand for energy has brought the world to an inflection point: we have an urgent and critical need for resource and energy transformation. 

Even more, we must identify innovative ways to produce and consume energy while minimizing our impact on the environment.

Inventing the technology to solve this challenge is no small task. But, we believe that when armed with the right tools, resources and network, entrepreneurs are capable of developing solutions to these problems.

It’s time to harness the collective intelligence and energy of cleantech startups, innovators, investors and industry experts to mitigate the global climate crisis we face as a population.


OUR STORY


OUR COMMUNITY

We’re comprised of passionate entrepreneurs solving big energy and environmental problems. Our startups represent the engineers, business experts, physicists, chemists, botanists, roboticists and other industry pioneers who are working day and night to build the next product to address society’s environmental challenges.

At our facility in Somerville, MA, just 3.5 miles from downtown Boston, we offer 33,000 sq. ft. of prototyping lab and co-working space, a shared machine shop, and an electronics shop. Members of our community are immersed in a growing network of local, national and international cleantech resources and fellow entrepreneurs. We host more than 150 events and 10,000+ visitors every year, and those numbers continue to climb.
