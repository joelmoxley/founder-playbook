OUR STORY

Place-Based Innovation
noun
Innovation that looks at the needs of a specific place and then works with the community to find and implement innovative solutions

We are now Elemental Excelerator! After about seven years building our program under the name Energy Excelerator, we changed our name in April 2017 as our program grows. Our new name helps communicate that we work across systems that affect infrastructure, the environment, and quality of life — including energy, water, agriculture, and transportation systems.

We believe in the power of innovation and people to create transformative change. We work to improve communities through technology innovation, economic opportunity, and sustainable modernization. This is what we call place-based innovation. What does that mean? It means that we look at the challenges of a specific place and then work with the community and startups to solve these challenges in innovative ways.

Elemental Excelerator is a nonprofit created in collaboration with Emerson Collective, an investment and philanthropic platform. Elemental Excelerator works collaboratively with Emerson Collective’s Elemental practice, which focuses on strengthening the relationship between humanity and nature through scalable, equitable, and innovative solutions. We are funded by the U.S. Navy and a diverse coalition of utility partners, corporate partners, the U.S. Department of Energy, state government, and philanthropic organizations. Our goal is not only to curate a portfolio of innovative and impactful startups, but also to build an ecosystem of passionate people working to change the world, one community at a time. We hope you’ll join us.



Our Impact

Each September, we publish our annual report. Our reports look a little different from those typically produced by financial institutions, tech companies, government agencies, or nonprofits. This is because our program is a hybrid. We stand at the nexus of investors, tech accelerators, and government grant programs. And yes, we are a nonprofit.
