DO YOU WANT TO SOLVE AMERICA’S ENERGY CHALLENGES?
Energy entrepreneurs all over the country are coming up with revolutionary ideas that have the potential to change how America uses energy. However, these same innovators frequently face daunting challenges that delay promising ideas from entering commercial practice, including limited early-stage capital, long validation requirements, and difficulty scaling up laboratory technology to commercial scale.

ORNL recognizes these challenges and, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy, has developed a program, Innovation Crossroads, to help entrepreneurs create the next generation of clean energy companies. At Innovation Crossroads, ORNL will match innovators with technology leaders, experienced mentors, and business and investment networks that can accelerate the transition of their world-changing ideas to the marketplace.
