Seven Elements of Negotiation
* Interest - needs, aims, fears (vs. positions or demands)
* Alternatives - walkways, what one would do "Away from the table" on their own or with another person (not arbitrary bottom lines)
* Options - possible "On the table" solutions or pieces of a solution (creative possibilitieS)
* Legitimacy - objective standards, criteria, fair processes (ways to explain, defend the outcome)
* Commitments - agreements between the parties (offers, agreements)
* Relationship - how we work with the other negotiator
* Communication - how we communicate with the other negotiator


Seven Levers To Be Used in Multiple Ways
* Interests
* Alternatives
* Options
* Legitimacy
* Commitments
* Relationship
* Communication

Useful For:
* Assessing Success
* Providing Effective Instructions
* Preparing
* Understanding Choices
* Diagnosing and Managing Difficult Tactics
* Reviewing


Positional Bargaining: The Dance of Concessions
Offer

Final Offer
Last Final Offer
Split-the-difference compromise

Walk Out (Temporarily)


Principled Negotiation: The Circle fo Value
Relationship 
Communication
Interests
Options
Legitimacy
If "No"
If "Yes"
Alternatives
Commitment


Negotiation: A Key Choice
Classic Positional Bargaining
Assumptions:
* Pie is fixed
* Only job of negotiator is to claim value

Joint Problem-Solving
Assumptions:
* Pie can be expanded
* Negotiators should work together to create and distribute value


Substance and Relationship
Substance
Our Goal
Relationship



The Common Dilemma
Soft
* "Have to talk"
* Insist on maintaining friendship
* Open with a reasonable position
* Concede generously
* "Will"/offers

Hard
* "Don't have to talk"
* Insist on my position
* Open with an extreme position
* Concede stubbornly
* "Won't"/threats


Why Each is Correct
Soft
* O.K. to talk
* Relationship is important
* Power in being reasonable
* O.K. to be flexible
* Offers are good

Hard
* O.K. to walk
* Substance is important
* Power in anchoring
* O.K. to be firm
* Wise to disclose limits



Common Errors
* Ignore Alternatives
* Assume a choice: Relationship or substance
* Focus on positions, ignore Interests
* Mix inventing and deciding, limiting Options
* Ignore Legitimacy: What parties should do
* One-way Communication: Talking at them
* Commitment before listening


A Way Out: "Rules of Thumb" for Putting the Elements into Play
Be unconditionally constructive on RELATIONSHIP
Separate out RELATIONSHIP from substance, as appropriate
Promote good two-way COMMUNICATION
Listen, and show you have heard and understand
Clarify and Articulate INTERESTS
Dig under positions for INTERESTS
Invent many OPTIONS
Separate inventing OPTIONS from deciding
Maximize LEGITIMACY 
Talk about what you "ought" to do. Use LEGITIMACY (Criteria) as "Sword" or "Shield"
Acknowledge ALTERNATIVES to joint decisions
Really test each party's best ALTERNATIVE (BATNA)
COMMIT early, and jointly, on process
COMMIT carefully, only after inventing options, to substance



Negotiating on the merits: Communication
* Assumption: The best approach is to tell them what you want and how you see things
* Partial Validity: Sharing your view is important
* Common Error: 
  * One-way communication ignores the importance of listening
  * You can't persuade them unless you know and address what they are thinking
* Guidelines
  * Seek high-quality two-way communication: Explain your reasoning; inquire into their; Balance advocacy and inquiry
  * Listen, and show that you have heard: Listening illuminates their interests and builds the relationship; Be able to put their case as well as or better than they can
  * Negotiate explicitly over process: clarify goals, agenda; set ground rules
  

Exercise: How old?


When Things Go Wrong...
First Work to Understand Each Other's Story
* Each of us tells a story about what happened based on:
  * Different information
  * Different interpretations of ambiguous information
  * Different assumptions about missing information
* Different conclusions are inevitable
* Debating conclusions is unpersuasive, escalates conflict, and hurts the relationship
* Seeking to understand (and combine) different stories generates new insight, resolves conflict, and strengthens the relationship
* "And" accurately captures this complexity; "but" denies it


Explore Each Other's Reasoning
Share
Inquire
My Conclusions
Their Conclusions
My Interpretations
Their Interpretations
My Data
Their Data
Data Pool



A Picture of Engaging In A Learning Conversation
Think
Conclusion:
* Share your conclusions, describing how you get from your interpretations to your conclusions. Encourage the other party to ask questions about your conclusions, or the process that led you to those conclusions.
* Ask the other party what their conclusions are, and how they get from their interpretations to their conclusions. Ask questions about their conclusions, or the process they took to get there.

Interpretations:
* Share the interpretations that you draw from your data (and theirs, if it is relevant), and why. Invit the other party to ask questions about your interpretations.
* Ask the other party to share the interpretations they draw from their data (and from yours, if it is relevant), and why. Ask questions about their interpretations.

Data:
* Specify the facts, figures, actions, conversations, etc. that you are relying upon to reach your conclusions. Invite the other party to ask questions about the data you shared.
* Ask the other party to specify the facts, figures, actions, conversations, etc. that they are relying upon to reach their conclusions. Ask questions about the data they shared.



Partisan Perceptions - Guidelines
* Adopt a frame of mind for understanding
  * Assume partisan perceptions exist - ours as well as theirs
  * Seek to understand, and show understanding before seeking to be understood
* Make "understanding" a collaborative effort
  * Consider discussing partisan perceptions early and explicitly
  * Make mutual understanding the goal, consider carefully whether agreement is necessary
* Dig for the data, reveal the reasoning
  * Be explicit about hte data you see; ask what data are important to them
  * Discuss how each of you interprets the data and reaches conclusions
  * Create new perceptions, rather than battle over old ones
  * Seek nonconforming data, for both their view and yours
  * Avoid conforming data
  
  

Negotiating on the merits: Relationship
* Assumption: Insist on maintaining relationship or insist on your position
* Partial Validity: Relationship and substantive interests are each important
* Common Error: Assumes that you must choose either to preserve the relationship or to satisfy your substantive interests
* Guidelines
  * Distinguish relationship issues from substantive and deal with each on its own merits: soft on the people, hard on the problem
  * Avoid trying to fix relationship problems with substantive concessions
  

Disentangle substance from relationship... and negotiate each on their own merits (negotiate on two tracks)
Substantive Issues
* Past damages
* Future damages
* Intelligence
* Security
* Finding brother

Relationship Issues
* Eroded trust
* Partisan perceptions - different facts, different interpretations, therefore different stories
* Lack of reliability/broken commitments
* Feeling of being unfairly treated


Building a relationship independent of agreement or disagreement
* Accept the people: treat them with respect
  * Speak for yourself, not for them
  * Avoid surprises: Consult before deciding
  * Seek to persuade, not coerce
* Seek to understand their views (and demonstrate it)
  * Understanding =/ agreement
  * Their view likely reflects different information and assumptions - test!
* Explore the merits together, side-by-side
  * Separate the parties from their arguments and actions
  * Share your views wiht honesty and vigor, but also humility - perhaps they know something you don't
* Be wholly trustworthy, but not wholly trusting
* Keep emotion and reason in balance



When Things Go Wrong...
Look for Joint Contribution Instead of Blame
* Blaming is based on fallacy, hurts the relationship, and distracts from fixing the problem
* Joint contribution is realistic, strengthens the relationship (we're in this together), and focuses on what can make a difference
* Start with your contribution, but don't end there; help them see their



Negotiating on the merits: Interests
* Assumption: Start with a position - either reasonable or extrme
* Partial Validity
  * Being reasonable is ofter persuasive
  * "Anchoring" often works
* Common Error: Focusing on positions
* Guidelines
  * Clarify interests, not positions
  * Dig under demands for underlying interests. Ask, "Why?" "For what purpose do you want that?" "What are you trying to achieve?"
  * Share some of your interests to prime the pump
  * Share your understanding of their interests and ask for feedback
  * Solicit criticism of possible options; ask for comparative assessment of possible options



The Power of Criticism: "What would be wrong with X?"
Relationship 
Communication
Interests
Options
Legitimacy
Alternatives
Commitment



Negotiating on the merits: Options
* Assumption: Negotiate by conceding -  generously or stubbornly 
* Partial Validity
  * It's OK to be flexible
  * It's OK to be firm  
* Common Error: Mixing inventing with deciding
* Guidelines
  * Separate brainstorming from evaluating and deciding. Break up decision-making into option generation, option evaluation and refinement, and commitment
  * Jointly brainstorming multiple options
  * Invent options for mutual gain. Look for differences in interests to create value. Craft a choice attractive to them
  * Postpone commitments: nothing is agreed until everything is agreed



No-Waste Options - The Pareto Frontier
Wasted Value
Your Satisfaction
Partner's Satisfaction


Negotiating on the merits: Legitimacy
* Assumption: Tell them what we will or won't do
* Partial Validity: Offers are good, and it's often wise to disclose limits
* Common Error: Ignores the power of legitimacy - framing discussion in terms of what parties ought to do
* Guidelines:
  * Maximize legitimacy by using independent standards or principles of fairness to distinguish among options (seek criteria persuasive to them)
  * Use standards as a "sword" to persuade ("We might base this on...") and as a "shield" to protect ("Why that number?" "Based on what?" "How would I explain agreeing to this?")
  * To combine empathy and assertiveness: "I can see why you want that. Help me understand why you deserve it."
  * Use the Test of Reciprocity. Consider fair procedures.
  * Be sure you are open to persuasion
  
  
  
Negotiating on the merits: Alternatives
* Assumption: "Have to talk" or "Don't have to talk."
* Partial Validity: In general, it's OK to talk and OK to walk
* Common Error: Ignores your actual BATNA in this situation
* Guidelines
  * Negotiate as long as the chance of reaching an agreement better than your BATNA and theirs makes it worth your time
  * Consider revealing your BATNA when it's better than they think
  * Consider reality testing how well their BATNA satisfies their interests, if you think they are overestimating it
  * Use BATNA discussions as an opportunity to learn more about interests and jointly seek options better than your respective BATNAs
  
  
  
Negotiating on the merits: Commitment
* Assumption: Negotiation involves trading commitments
* Partial Validity: One goal of negotiation is a mutual commitment, if one makes sense
* Common Error
  * Premature commitment limits creativity
  * Since changing circumstances may make negotiated commitments obsolete, building a good working relationship may be as important
* Guidelines
  * Commit early to process. Consider a framework agreement
  * Postpone substantive commitments to the end. Clarify that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed
  * Make commitments sufficient, realistic, and operational, and state/record their purpose to facilitate understanding and interpretation during implementation
  * Build in processes for review, revision, and conflict management
  
  
  
Rules of Thumb



Positional Bargaining
Pros
* Easy to understand
* Simple communication
* Can be quick and efficient
* Very operational
* Requires little preparation
* Universally understood
* Often expected
* Keeps a team in line
* Can be fun
* Always seems like you get something

Cons
* Rewards stubborness and deception
* Discourage exploration of interests and options
* Promotes arbitrary outcomes
* Takes longer in complex or multiparty situations
* Risks relationship damage and no deal even when agreement makes sense
* Always have to give something up
* Always wondering if you could have gotten more

Best For
* Simple transactions; low stakes; market context; one-shot (?) deals; or as a game for fun


Principled ("Circle of Value") Negotiation
Pros
* Explores interests and promotes efficiency and joint gains
* Benefits from the wisdom of the community (precedent)
* Results can be explained to constituents
* Avoid having to choose between a good relationship and a good deal
* Avoids arbitrary outcomes

Cons
* Risk to relationship from misuderstanding
* May disagree over existence of size of past favors
* Requires crystal clear communication
* Often ignores the merits and sets lousy precedents
* Seldom persuasive to constituents
* Big risk if parties change

Best For
High stakes; where precedent and relationship matterl for important, complex, and/or multiparty problems



Effective Preparation (Beyond Gives, Gets, Bottom Lines, Trades) is a Key Enabler: A 7-Element Checklist for Negotiation Preparation
* INTERESTS - What are Ours? Their? Others?
* OPTIONS - How can we satisfy their and our interests?
* LEGITIMACY - What objective standards, criteria, or fair processes can we use to sort through Options?
* ALTERNATIVES - How can we satisfy our interests without them? Any ways to improve? How might they satisfy their interests without us? Any ways to weaken?
* COMMITMENT - What level of authority do we have? Do we think they have? What level of commitment do we went to have by the end of this upcoming negotiation session?
* COMMUNICATION - What processs/agenda do we think is best for this upcoming session? What questions do we want to ask? What messages do we want to send?
* RELATIONSHIP - What kind of working relationship do we want to build? What do we want to do/avoid in the upcoming session to develop this kind of relationship?



Kissinger (Tries to) Brief Nixon: As You Choose How to Negotiate, Beware of Rewarding Bad Behavior

Success Requires a Critical Shift
From...
...To
What do you want?
Why do you want it?
Will you accept/give up?
What are some different possible ways we might resolve this?
How about we just split it?
By what criteria/legitimate process can we evaluate (and defend) the best answer?
Saying, "I understand"
Showing I understand
Thinking my strength comes form konowing I am right, anchoring well, and effectively using threats
Thinking my strength comes from being open to learning and persuasion, being skilled at figuring out their motivations, and being extremely creative



And It Requires Discipline
In the context where we are most tempted - and have the best excuses - to revert to our natural approach to negotiation, we have the greatest neeed to take a step back, consider our choices, shape the process and act "purposively".
