Nothing in the Agreement will result in ABC being a partner of Halotechnics nor impose any partnership obligation on either party.  The Agreement does not confer any authority on either party to enter into any commitment on behalf of the other party.  

2.2	Entire Agreement
The Agreement constitutes the whole and only agreement between ABC and Halotechnics relating to the Work and Work Product and supersedes any other agreement, document or pre-contractual statement relating to the same subject matter.

For the purposes of this clause, “pre-contractual statement” includes any agreement, undertaking, representation, warranty, promise, assurance, arrangement or draft of any nature whatsoever, whether or not in writing, relating to the subject matter of the Agreement and which is not repeated in the Agreement, made by any person at any time before the date of the Agreement.

Without limiting the foregoing, the terms and conditions contained in the Agreement that the Parties intend to survive, including with respect to confidentiality, Intellectual Property Rights, audit rights, warranties, dispute resolution, obligations related to termination and provisions related to interpretation, all survive termination and expiry of the Agreement for the benefit of the Party to whom they are given.

2.4	Successors
The Agreement will bind and enure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties.

2.5	No Waiver
A Party’s waiver of any breach of the other Party’s obligations will not be binding unless the waiver is in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving Party, and no waiver will limit or affect the waiving Party’s rights with respect to any other or future breach.  The single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided by law or under the Agreement, as the case may be, will not preclude any other or further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.  No delay or omission on the part of either Party hereto to exercise any right or remedy under any Agreement will be construed or operated as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy as the case may be.  ABC and Halotechnics will retain all rights and remedies, both under the Agreement and at law that either may have against the other.

If any provision of the Agreement should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect or in any circumstance, the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other respect or circumstance will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and, in the event the finding of invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability is not accompanied by an alternate provision, the Parties will endeavor to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with a similar provision and the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

(a)	Receiving Party can show is, at the time of its disclosure, or subsequently, in the public domain through no fault or omission of Receiving Party Group;

(e)	is disclosed by the Disclosing Party to a third party without an obligation of confidentiality.
For the purposes of this Section 8.2, specific disclosures made hereunder shall not be deemed to be within the above exceptions merely because they are embraced by general disclosures in the public knowledge or literature or in the possession of or independently developed by or for Receiving Party, and any combination of features disclosed hereunder shall not be deemed within the above exceptions merely because individual features are in the public knowledge or literature or in the possession of or independently developed by or for Receiving Party.
8.3	This Agreement shall not be construed to grant Receiving Party Group any ownership interest, license to or other use rights in or to the Disclosing Party Confidential Information or related information, except as expressly noted herein.
8.4	In the event Receiving Party receives an order, notice, subpoena or is otherwise required to disclose the Disclosing Party Confidential Information to a governmental agency or judicial body, Receiving Party shall promptly forward a copy of such order, notice, or subpoena to Disclosing Party to allow Disclosing Party the opportunity to oppose the order, notice, or subpoena, or seek a protective order to limit such disclosure. In the event that Disclosing Party is unable to prevent such disclosure, or obtain a protective order, Receiving Party may disclose only the Disclosing Party Confidential Information as is required to be responsive to the order, notice, or subpoena.

8.5	Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict or prohibit the right of a Disclosing Party to disclose its respective Confidential Information to any third party under any conditions.
8.6	The Parties acknowledge that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for breach of any of the provisions of this Clause 8.

Risks and Work Plan to Mitigate Risks
Phase 1: Market Analysis and Preliminary Design
Duration: 3 months
Budget: $200,000

Major tasks:
1.	Quantitative Competition Analysis
Develop comprehensive survey of competing electricity storage technologies. Compare 	head to head with quantitative metrics, including capital cost, levelized cost, round trip efficiency (RTE), scalability, and siting restrictions. Example metrics and technologies are shown in table below.

Technology	Players	Capital cost ($/kWh)	Capital cost ($/kW)	RTE	Total cycles	Scalability (max power)	Siting restrictions	Known projects
Battery (lead acid)								
Battery (lithium ion)								
Battery (sodium sulfur)								
Flow battery (vanadium redox)			
				
Pumped hydro								
CAES (underground)								
Isothermal CAES								
Adiabatic CAES								
Liquid air energy storage								
RHEES 565 Heat Pump								
RHEES 565 Heater								
RHEES 1200 Heat Pump								
RHEES 1200 Heater								

2.	Economics/Market Analysis
Cost estimate: Estimate installed capital cost of 1 MW pilot system for both 565 °C and 1200 °C RHEES in both heat pump and heater configurations. Determine key metrics such as $/kW and $/kWh. Obtain vendor quotes for key components and estimate construction and commissioning costs. Make a bottoms-up budget with line items for a complete 1 MW system.

Customer outreach: Use cost estimate to engage potential customers of the system and determine whether the system would be economically viable at the projected installed cost and efficiency. Determine best use case scenario in dialog with customers, for example energy arbitrage, peaker plant operation, or capacity firming. Potential customers include utilities in Hawaii, Pacific Northwest, Texas, and California. Industrial customers who are large consumers of electricity are also potential customers, such as aluminum, steel, glass, and polysilicon manufacturers. Owners of wind, PV, and peaker plant assets are another possible customer set. Review wind specific value proposition with key wind developers and owners. Determine best path to market and first customer.

Review regional market factors and industry knowledge on storage value proposition. Reviews tariff rules, PUC regulations, time of use factors, and energy off-taker rates to obtain the most accurate picture of the value of energy storage. 

3.	Compressor and EPC Partners
Identify candidate vendors for high temperature compressor, a key system component. Set up introductory phone calls and visits as appropriate with candidate vendors. Discuss possible strategic relationships with vendors, such as equity investment or donated equipment for pilot plant. Vendors must be able to scale to 10 MW and larger product capability.

Identify candidate Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) partners. EPC firms will preferably have experience in building molten salt storage systems. Solicit technical feedback from qualified EPC’s on ways to increase the performance or reduce the cost of the system by changing salt properties and adding an electric heater or heat pump in place of solar collector. Obtain cost estimates and identify key component R&D needed to achieve the next level of performance.  

4.	Preliminary Design
Performance modeling: Develop performance model with turbomachinery and process modeling software packages. Calculate round trip efficiency, ramp up/ramp down rates, and turnaround time from charge to discharge operation. Estimate cost and performance of molten salt system (up to 565 °C) vs. molten glass system (1200 °C). Estimate cost and performance tradeoff of heat pump vs. simple resistive heater. 

Operational Optimization: Determine required system operational profile (ways which electricity can be bought and sold using storage) based upon customer and vendor feedback. Calculate size of major components, such as heat exchangers, hot storage tanks, and cold storage tanks. Calculate footprint and siting requirements. Use the performance model, cost estimates from vendors and EPCs and the pro-forma to assess salt vs. glass storage and heat pumps vs. electric heaters.  Down select one design from various system configurations at the end of this task.

ABC to review design and provide input on storage markets and applications. ABC input on preferred vendors and EPC partners may also be valuable.

Phase 2: Detailed Design and Controls
Duration: 3 months
Budget: $300,000

Major tasks:
1.	Detailed Design
Select optimal storage fluid and operation temperatures. Identify candidate vendors for additional system components (pumps, valves, heat exchangers, piping, insulation). Develop project budget to +/- 10% certainty. 

2.	System Controls and Instrumentation
Produce a block diagram and written description of the controls software to operate the storage system.  Provide the algorithms and calculations to monitor and control the system to continuously optimize the operation for the highest RTE. Design flexible test rig to vet controls algorithm and generate experimental data with heat pump functionality. Use commercially available motor, compressor, expander, pumps and valves when possible. Select industrial process control software utilizing off the shelf modules when possible. Develop customized component integration as necessary. Develop interface for real-time plant operation to coordinate motor, compressor/turbine, pumps, and valves. Task will result in robust control algorithm for heat pump electricity storage that will be used directly on 1 MW system. 

Phase 2 deliverables:
•	Front end engineering design (FEED) study for 1 MW pilot
•	Final P&ID
•	Final Heat and Mass Balance
•	Final Bill of Materials

Phase 3: Fabrication and Testing Proof of Concept
Duration: 6 months
Budget: $500,000

Major tasks:
1.	Fabricate lab scale test rig
Procure components for lab scale test rig. Size motor for approximately 30 kW electrical load (Win). Use water coolant as a proxy for molten salt to dump high quality heat (Qout). Use water-based fluid for delivering low quality heat to test rig (Qin). 

2.	System testing
Operate the lab scale test rig. Verify coefficient of performance (COP) matches the predicted value of the simulations. COP is targeted to be greater than one during operation. First iteration of test rig will use single stage compressor and air as working fluid. Subsequent iteration may add compressor stages or use argon as working fluid to increase compressor outlet temperature if desired up to 500-600 °C or to optimal temperature determined by pro-forma.  Design the test to reduce the risk and validate the component and system model in key technical areas such as the high temperature compressor, heat exchangers, and heat transfer fluid moving system. Lab scale test results will validate the feasibility of operating a high temperature heat pump and will provide experimental data that can be used to reduce perceived risk from subsequent partners and financial backers for the 1 MW pilot and commercial plants.

Test Plan:
•	Accelerate drive motor to full operating speed
•	Increase pump speeds for heat exchangers
•	Monitor fluid flow rates, temperatures, and pressures
•	Record electric power used to drive motor, low quality heat input, and high quality heat output. Calculate COP real time during testing.
•	Verify COP > 1 at steady state operation.
•	Ramp down drive motor and pumps until system is shut down.

3.	Identify site for 1 MW pilot
Utilize the complete design of the 1 MW pilot (FEED study, pro-forma, cost, performance estimates) to pitch project and identify candidate customers and project locations. Assess permitting and interconnection requirements. Engage prospective investors for project. Develop candidate site selection matrix.

Phase 3 deliverables:
•	Lab scale heat pump with data showing COP > 1 and generating heat flow at >200 °C
•	Verification of control algorithm for system start up, continuous operation, and shut down
•	Down select from candidate pilot plant sites and specify chosen site
