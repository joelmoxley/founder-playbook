	Instructions:			
	Welcome to the Updata Partners SaaS Metrics Worksheet. This template is a companion piece to the Updata Partners SaaS Metrics Framework, and will guide you through the steps of calculating two critical metrics: GMPP and rCAC. GMPP is Gross Margin Payback Period –  a measure of capital efficiency; rCAC is Return on Customer Acquisition Cost – a measure of lifetime profitability. While there are many SaaS metrics out there, calculating GMPP and rCAC yields a simple, clear, and thorough analysis of any recurring revenue business.			
	We recommend reading the white paper found here first and/or using it as a guide as you complete this template.			
	"As you will see in the framework, cohort analysis is critical. Aggregating data across time, customer types, and acquisition channels gives us the level of detail we need to determine which cohorts to feed...and which to starve. This worksheet is set up by default for analysis by quarterly vintage. However, we encourage running the analysis across products and acquisition channels to get a comprehensive view of unit economics.

Get started by selecting your cohort type in cell E6 on the next tab. To complete the worksheet, enter data into the yellow cells. Note the green boxes and ""Example"" in column K provide additional detail and a sample reference on individual line items. A fully built out analysis can be found in the ""Sample Analysis"" tab."
