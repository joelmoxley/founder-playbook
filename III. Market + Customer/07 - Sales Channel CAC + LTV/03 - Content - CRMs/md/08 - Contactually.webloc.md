HOMEABOUT US
About Contactually
Who we are, how we work, and why we're so excited to come into work every morning.

If you hadn’t already figured it out, we’re Contactually, a software and service company based in downtown Washington, DC. Founded in 2011, we’ve grown rapidly in just a couple of years, with an amazing team. We love dogs, technology, strange internet memes, and accomplishing great things through better, stronger relationships.


A company built around the user

Contactually is different. We saw that business software is something people are forced to use, not enjoy using. We thought that needed to change. We didn’t design our product to fit into an existing mold — we designed it to help people with their work. In order to do that, we didn’t model our company after competitors — we created a place we’d actually want to work, that allowed us to do what we’re good at and share it with others. The end result is the Contactually you see today, a growing, learning organism that’s constantly seeking to be better — for our customers, our product, our team, and our investors — than it was yesterday.

A strong, values-driven culture

Contactually is a lot of different things; it’s a technology, a company, a way of thinking, and a place to work. So what ties all of it together? We think it’s our culture, which affects everything from how we try to anticipate the needs of our customers, to the way we treat each other around the office.

Values are central to who we are. That means we decide what to do – both strategically and on a day to day basis – by leaning on a pretty thorough list of principles. A lot of them sound like common sense, but they keep us on the right track, and working on the right things.

The best group of people to work with

Ask a few employees, and you’ll find out very quickly if the people who make our business go feel like what they’re doing is important, whether their ideas matter or not, or if everyone is simply focused on making as much money as possible, as quickly as possible.

If you’re looking for a great place to work, we just might be that place. We’ve got a terrific office space in downtown Washington DC, and an enviable combination of awesome people, delicious snacks, and friendly canines just waiting for you.

Culture in action

A supportive environment, with above-market pay, flexible work policy, unlimited vacation, and many career-development avenues. Quarterly X-days, where everyone at Contactually puts aside their day-to-day work and tries to solve, build, and innovate.Our annual retreat, where we get out of the city and spend a few days solving big-picture problems, getting to know each other, and staying up too late. Our charitable partnerships, like our service day (where the company splits up into teams tasked with helping local DC charities), or sending Contactually team members to Haiti with Roots of Development to help communities use relationship management skills to improve the wellbeing of themselves and their neighbors…and of course, the Contactually dogs who entertain us, celebrate with us, and even (grudgingly) attend meetings.


We’re just getting started, but we’re already being noticed.

While we were founded in late 2011, we’ve been lucky to have received recognition by many respected sources, and written up time and time again. We must be on to something.
