Meet the people who make Olark

At Olark, we believe the world is a better place when everyone helps each other. So in 2009, with initial funding by Y Combinator, we built a live chat platform that enables businesses to connect with their customers.

Today Olark is used by more than 12,000 businesses worldwide, and our team has grown from four friends in Palo Alto to a fully remote team that spans three continents. We value diversity of thought and backgrounds and seek to hire genuine people who will push our culture to always be better, more inclusive, and more human.

I love working at Olark because of the awesome culture, and the fact that they support my fledgling vegetable business. I love growing veg and farming because it gives me a break from screens :-)

Every day a team of incredibly bright people wake up, sign on from around the world, and come together to make Olark work for our customers.

We've grown and changed so much since the beginning, but at our core Olark has remained about the people: our team, our customers, and our customers' customers.

Even though we're a remote company, there’s always someone there to bounce ideas off of, answer my questions or just there to listen.

While I do tend to Olark's cultural health, I found remote culture also takes care of me. I'm the most productive I've ever been thanks to schedule flexibility and not dealing with typical office distractions.

Olark has the best people I've ever worked with. Period.

Whichever work space I’m occupying, you'll probably find me on a couch trying to solve something-or-other. I'll always be known as "that guy with a goat farm", but I don't hold that against anyone.

I've benefitted first-hand from Olark's #assume and #practice values as I've had to take significant time off work to address my mental health and have had complete support from my team.

I love how I can honestly say that I like, admire and respect our CEO and COO on a personal level. It's a work-life-changing experience to be able to say that.

Our team has a great rhythm for a team that primarily works online, so if I want to go visit my family for a week, I can do that and keep projects moving along.

I've worked at huge companies and tiny companies, and Olark is easily the most thoughtful and forward-thinking company I've ever worked at.

Three months off for parental leave and the ability to watch my kids grow up instead of leaving for the work day are priceless gifts you don’t find in many workplaces.

My job at Olark is the best one I've ever had. Working remotely allows me to skip the nasty Maine winter commutes, and spend the day with my trusty canine coworker Rocky.

I asked my mom what made me unique. She said: "Your analytical side makes you good in the computer science industry but your spiritual side saves you from being a computer geek...LOL”
