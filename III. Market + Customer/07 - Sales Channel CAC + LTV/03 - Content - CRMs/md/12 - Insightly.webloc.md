Insightly: Built for the Web, Made for Small and Growing Businesses

We designed Insightly as a simple to use yet powerful CRM system for small business. With integrations to G Suite, Office 365, MailChimp, and major social media sites; great mobile apps for tablets and smart phones; and easy access to a REST API for custom integration, Insightly is the leading small business CRM.

We believe web based software is the best choice for smaller businesses, because you don’t have to worry about anything technical like server upgrades or security fixes. We take care of all the IT stuff like backups, upgrades, and security so you can concentrate on what matters – running your business and getting on with the job.


Over 1.2M users in over 200 countries rely on Insightly every single day

Lots of businesses rely on Insightly to manage their contacts, tasks and projects, and our infrastructure is built for the task. The Insightly server farm is located in a United States SSAE 16 type II audited data centre with redundant power and cooling, active fire detection and suppression, and staffed 24×7 by senior systems and network engineers.

We utilize storage infrastructure that is highly durable and fault tolerant, with multiple levels of redundancy built in – like writing every file to multiple storage facilities in different locations synchronously to ensure against data loss. Our databases are also backed up daily and securely transferred and stored with military grade AES-256 encryption to multiple off-site locations for disaster recovery purposes.

Finally, all our services are remotely monitored from 14 different locations on four continents around the world, to track uptime and response times and alert us of any abnormalities in service or performance, all in real-time.
