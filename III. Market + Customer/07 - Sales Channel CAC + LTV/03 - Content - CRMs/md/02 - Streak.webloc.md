Prior to Streak, Erik lead a team of engineers at HubSpot. Completely self-taught, he was building things on the web before his age reached double digits (plenty of “Under Construction” GIFs included). Outside of Streak, he is usually walking with his dogs somewhere in the beautiful California weather or devising increasingly complex ways to pull the perfect shot of espresso.
Rebecca Saines
Formerly a middle school math and science teacher, Becca is joining Streak after graduating from Hackbright Academy. When she isn't using her new tech skills, she can be found reading in the sunshine surround by her 3 cats, saintly spouse, and growing garden. Her Patronus is a hummingbird.
Fred Wulff
Prior to Streak, Fred led data infrastructure at Hillary for America and Dropbox. Born and raised in Texas, Fred ventured west in search of the internet, studying Computer Science at Stanford. He currently lives in Cole Valley and is trying, unsuccessfully and at length, to convince his dog that he can remember when he's already fed her no matter how much she begs for more food.

Why We're Here

Streak was born out of the frustration of constantly switching between our inbox (where we do our work) and external systems. Our goal is to make it simple to manage your everyday processes so you can close more deals, resolve more support tickets, and Get Things Done.

Streak is based in sunny San Francisco and backed by some of the smartest minds on the planet.
