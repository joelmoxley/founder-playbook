OUR STORY
Business teams are held back by the amount of data they need to find and manage. Every CRM today requires that organizations painfully build and maintain a database of businesses they might one day sell to; it’s an impossible task.

At DataFox we believe that every business should have a scalable solution for getting actionable, real-time insights on the companies they sell to without the grunt work so that employees can focus on what matters most - building relationships and growing their business.

...(and we're hiring!)
