Laboratory Capabilities Summary
Laboratory Overview
Halotechnics has developed a complete suite of capabilities for thermal materials synthesis and characterization: 
Proprietary material design software and database
High-throughput screening
Melting point, heat capacity, heat of fusion
Thermal stability
Viscosity
Density
Corrosion and materials compatibility


1. Material design software and database
* Halotechnics custom-built software allows the designer to vary multiple salt ions and view the projected phase space in real time.
* Once a design is settled, the candidates are dispensed, synthesized, and screened for melting point.
* Searchable database of 23,000 mixtures including nitrates, chlorides, carbonates, sulfates, oxides
* Halotechnics products were developed by screening over 23,000 unique mixtures
* Properties in searchable database: composition, melting point, thermal stability

5. Viscosity
Measure viscosity vs. temperature, a critical parameter for systems design/engineering. 
Orton molten glass viscometer capable of operation up to 1600 °C
Modified Brookfield viscometer capable of measuring molten salt viscosity from room temperature up to 565 °C.
Viscosity data for quaternary salt mixtures (Bradshaw and Siegel, 2009)



6. Density
Measure density vs. temperature with Halotechnics’ custom-built  Archimedean furnace density measurement system:
* Stainless steel sinker hung beneath analytical balance
* Sinker suspended in molten salt inside temperature-controlled crucible furnace
* Buoyancy force offsets weight
* Data acquisition system computes density as a function of temperature
