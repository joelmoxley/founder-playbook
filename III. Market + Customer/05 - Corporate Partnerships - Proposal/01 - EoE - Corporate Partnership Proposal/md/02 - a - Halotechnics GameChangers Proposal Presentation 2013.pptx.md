Heat pump 101
* Enabling technology is heat pump + thermal storage
* Heat pumps use electricity to drive heat “uphill” from cold to hot
* Key metric is Coefficient of Performance (COP) 
  * COP = Hot Flow / Electricity Input
  * COP can be greater than 1
* More effective than simple resistive heating which is “only” 100% efficient

Opportunity to upgrade waste heat from Shell refinery or chemical plant



Heat pump charge
* Charge: Use turbine to compress inert gas
* Store heat in Haloglass
* Store cold in water based mixture

compress
expand



Heat engine discharge
* Discharge: Utilize turbine in standard heat engine mode
* Use heat in Haloglass to heat gas and generate power 
* Use cold to chill inlet gas and increase efficiency



Old idea enabled by new materials
* GameChanger-Halotechnics project to build first of a kind thermal electricity storage system
* Halotechnics high temperature fluids are the first to make the concept commercially viable

The hotter, the better…



The hotter the better
* Two fundamental truths drive our work. As storage temperature increases:
  1. Efficiency goes up
  2. Cost goes down

High temperature, high efficiency
RTE = COP x η
High temperature, low cost
Gen 1 (salt)
Gen 2 (glass)

Gathering momentum for storage
Shell Energy North America is a player in the California market
“AB 2514 requires storage procurement targets for load-serving entities, including direct access electric service providers (ESPs)...”

California Sets Energy Storage Target of 1.3GW by 2020
After years of wrangling, California's energy storage future starts to take shape.

California Energy-Storage Plan May Require $3 Billion Investment



The demand for electricity storage
Typical Day, Winter/Spring 2020
CAISO predicts 12,000 MW storage needed for 3 hours, 
twice a day to stabilize renewables’ intermittency  



Application 1: Renewable peaker plant
1. Find the cheapest source of energy
Off-peak electricity in areas of high wind penetration
2. Sell it at the highest value
Late afternoon peak demand on hot days
This a proven business model. 
It’s a peaker plant!



Application 2: Energy trading
* Storage provides optionality to energy traders
* Shell Energy North America is a leader in this market
* Energy trading promotes grid stability
* Storage allows arbitrage based on time of day pricing and other ways to optimize procurement contracts

Input from Shell will add value to the storage solution 



Becoming a leader in storage
1. There will be a large market demand for ~100 MW storage plants
2. There is no existing storage technology that can meet this demand, due to technical or economic shortcomings
3. Halotechnics has the solution and can offer valuable engineering services to EPC’s building the storage plants according to our design
4. Halotechnics has unparalleled capabilities to develop proprietary thermal storage materials for storage plant designs

Shell brings strategic value as a partner and customer for Halotechnics advanced storage plants
