Phase 1 work: Conclusions
1. Equipment needed for high temperature heat pump is technically feasible but not commercially available
2. Reducing cost is #1 priority in energy storage market
3. Electrical resistive heater and molten salt energy storage has near-term commercial opportunities
4. Molten glass energy storage may further reduce storage cost 


A new energy storage platform
* Molten glass enables new energy storage platform
  * Inherently cheap storage material (low $/kWh)
  * 4x storage density vs. molten salt (high kJ/L)
* New storage applications
  * Low cost electrical energy storage
  * Greater flexibility in gas turbines by storing heat at full combustion gas temperature
  * Low carbon steam production

Charging
* Electrical energy
* Combustion

Discharging
* Molten salt
* Air
* Steam


Integrate into existing thermal power plants
Inject heat further upstream:
* Higher temperature (higher efficiency, higher energy density)
* Leverage more existing equipment (lower capex)

Showstoppers to molten glass energy storage
Lessons learned from previous work with phosphate and vanadium based glasses
  Showstopper
  Solution
  1. Pumpable glass manufactured cost too high
  Use soda lime glass, Na2O-CaO-SiO2, ~$200/ton 
  2. No practical containment material
  Use zirconia ceramics, proven for years with soda lime glass
  3. No interface to power block
  Control heat release with salt or air, no glass pumping
Halotechnics has unique capabilities and can build on previous experience to develop practical molten glass energy storage

Market driven design
* Decentralized generation (20-50 MW) is the correct size for procurement
  * Utilities have built hundreds of natural gas peaker plants in this size range
* Sufficient discharge profile (4 hours duration on 3 consecutive days) to qualify for “capacity payments”
  * Utilities pay for standby power, available upon demand.
  * Typical payment is in $/kW-month regardless of hours of operation
* Use the minimum required storage output duration
  * Reduces capex required to qualify for capacity payments
* Plant must last >10 years for good project economics

Commercial viability requires 20-50 MW, 4 hours storage plant with minimum 10 year life



Dimensions and storage capacity
Base-case design:
* Glass reservoir sized for 2000 ton inventory (common in glass industry)
* Square footprint (22 m x 22 m) to reduce surface area and cost
* 1.8 m (72”) glass pool depth is feasible with standard furnace designs

At target ΔT of 500 °C, design can store 400 MWht, enough for 
40 MWe, 4 hours storage


Base-case design: Process flow diagram
Patent pending


Capital cost budget
* Given revenues from capacity payments and estimated O&M costs, how much capital cost can we allow and still achieve an acceptable IRR?
Assumptions:
* 40 MW, 4 hours storage 
* Glass inventory: $0.4 million
* Soft costs (project development, permitting): 5% capex 
* O&M costs: 2% capex annually
* Rebuild furnace every 10 years
* $10/kW-month capacity payments

Molten glass shows promise as commercially viable energy storage technology

Technical challenges
1. Glass properties suitable for storage
  * Inherently low cost and stable
2. Charging
  * Electrode heater power
  * Electrode heater lifetime
3. Storing
  * Heat losses through tank walls 
4. Thermal cycling
  * Thermal shock to refractories
  * Thermal expansion of tank
5. Discharging thermal energy from glass
  * Achieving high heat flux
  * Controlling discharge rate
  * Heat transfer to power block

Risk Profile:
* Feasible
* Need GameChanger!


Glass properties
Glass could be used as a stable, low-cost thermal energy storage media
* Glass cullet (sorted, recycled glass) available in millions of tons annually at <$200/ton
* Want low-iron clear glass for better radiative heat transfer from bulk (<0.1% Fe2O3)

  Property
  Value
  Typical composition by weight (soda lime window glass)
  73% SiO2, 14% Na2O,9% CaO, 4% MgO, 0.15% Al2O3, 0.1% Fe2O3  
  Heat capacity (Cp)
  1.45 kJ/kg-K
  Density (ρ)
  2300 kg/m3
  Maximum temperature stability (alkali volatilization)
  1500-1600 °C
  Softening point
  700-800 °C
Typical clear glass cullet



Charging
It is feasible to achieve 40 MW heating power or more with standard electrodes
* Molten glass is a good electrical conductor
* Electric glass melting furnaces up to 300 tons/day in commercial use
* Molybdenum electrode heaters can last for entire furnace campaign (7-10 years)



Storing: heat losses through tank walls
It is feasible to achieve <5% heat losses per day with standard insulating materials
* Assume 2000 ton glass inventory (size of large commercial float glass furnace)
* Thin AZS refractory layer for corrosion resistance
* ~18” firebrick layer for low-cost, resilient insulation. Forms “self sealing” cold zone
* Steel shell for structural strength
* Additional external insulation to reduce heat losses

<0.6 kW/m2 heat losses




Thermal cycling
Must verify that refractory can withstand 2000 thermal cycles (10+ year life)
* Refractories can typically withstand some thermal swings, for example due to idling a furnace over the weekend
* High temperature ramp rates result in higher stresses
* ASTM standard for thermal shock resistance measures strength after repeated, rapid cycling from 1200 °C to room temperature
* Too severe to predict behavior for our system


Refractory thermal cycling and corrosion tests
* Test thermal cycling first, then corrosion resistance (will be a trade-off)
  * Chromia (Cr2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), and alumina (Al2O3) fused-cast refractories are most corrosion resistant
  * Sintered refractories are most shock resistant
  * Can tailor composition and manufacturing process to achieve better overall performance
* Test refractory samples in lab furnace
  * Thermal cycling: 6 cycles per day, repeat ~200x for 1 year accelerated life
  * Corrosion: Isothermal test with glass
  * Assess mechanical strength and/or corrosion rate of samples
* Select refractories with guidance from commercial vendors
  * Durital, Monofrax (RHI)
  * Zirchrome (Saint-Gobain SEFPRO)

Thermal cycling profile

Discharging: adequate heat flux
Must verify ability to achieve 4-8 hour discharge times with reasonable furnace geometries
* Target 100 MWt heat transfer rate from glass to meet 4 hr discharge spec
* Requires ~200 kW/m2 from glass pool
  * Easier at 1500 °C. Harder at 1000 °C.
* Must promote good convection
  * Bubblers
  * Convoluted flow path
  * Turbulent flow
* Must promote good radiation
  * Use clear (low iron) glass

>200 kW/m2 heat transfer


Thermal design and modeling
* Verify key performance metrics via iterative design and modeling
  * Heat discharge rate
  * Heat losses
  * Thermal expansion of refractories
* Leverage existing regenerator designs for cooling air flow
* Optimize glass pool depth for tradeoff between heat losses and discharge performance
* Mature modeling software available from glass industry

Refractory checker-brick regenerator


Budget and timeline
* $425,000 budget, 8 month project in two phases
  * Phase 2: $250,000. Refractory thermal testing and system design.
  * Phase 3: $175,000. Corrosion testing, thermal modeling and design iteration.


Follow on plan
Pilot plant with strategic partners at location TBD
* Typical utilities require minimum of 1 MW plant with 1 year of operational data to be considered “proven technology”
