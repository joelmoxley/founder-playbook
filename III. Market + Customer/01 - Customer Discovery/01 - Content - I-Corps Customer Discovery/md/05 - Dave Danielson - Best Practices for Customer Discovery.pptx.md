 DISCOVERY = DIRECT ENGAGEMENT:
CUSTOMERS

EXPERTS
OTHER PLAYERS

More startups fail from alack of customers than from a failure of product development
Customer Discovery Outcomes
Test business hypotheses, pivot quickly, find product/market fit

What are the top customer problems?
How much would they value a solution?

Does your product concept solve these problems?

Customer org chart: users, buyers, influencers, decision makers

Identify “earlyvangelists” who can be first customers/partners


Start Now

Do Your Homework

Start Low, Aim High

Listen: Listen a lot, stay broad, Don’t Lead the Witness

Go Exponential: Get 2-3 new intros from every call
Develop one or more hypotheses for every element of the business (i.e. each slide/key business issue area).

Use these to drive your outreach/interview approach

Iterate Quickly

HYPOTHESIS  INTERVIEWS  ANALYSIS/ASSESSMENT  ITERATE

HUSTLE is a strategy
Best = WARM INTRODUCTIONS
Be clear on what you want to learn from them/their unique expertise
Play the “learning” & “student” cards
Start by targeting mid-level mgmt – more knowledge, time, inclination
Email/Call – multiple touches OK/good
All sources (alumni directory, linked in, etc, etc)
Face to face ideal, phone OK
Have a basic script – know what you’re trying to learn
2-3 team mates in each engagement – lead, scribe, strategy
Quick intros
Be humble, emphasize how valuable will be for you – learning emphasis
Don’t lead the witness, open ended questions
Go deeper: drill down on answers… ask why….
Keep them talking…. Listen, listen, listen…. talk
DON’T SELL… focus on learning
Focus on their pain, not yours…
Embrace bad news… avoid confirmation bias
Write down great verbatim quotes for your problem/traction slide
“What else should we be asking?”
Ask if can check back in after interview (in a couple of weeks)
Thank you + Thank you follow up email
Get 2-3 strong references, ideally intros
Record results
Share results/insights with whole team

“If you were us, what problem would you be working on?”
Low Interview Count
Talking to Too Many People Like You
Only Good News from Interviews
Get after it!
Push through the pain!
Start today!
