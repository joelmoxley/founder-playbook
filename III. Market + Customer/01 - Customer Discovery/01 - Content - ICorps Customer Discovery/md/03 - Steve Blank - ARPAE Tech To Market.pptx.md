Here's an example of a description that appears under a link.

15 MIN READ || This presentation by Steve Blank, the thought leader behind the Lean Startup approach, walks through the pitfalls of developing a buisness as startup, and specifically higlights how startup operations and purpose differ tfrom those of a large coproration in that startups are searching for a new business model while corporations are executing known plans. The deck also includes a range of exmaples from a hardtech startup to corporate initiatives.

Lesson 2
Lets Change The Definition of a Startup


Theory


All I Need to Do is Execute the Plan


Reality


No Business Plan Survives First Contact With Customers


Lets Change the Definition


A Startup is a temporary organization


A Startup is a temporary organization designed to search



A Startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model


Startups need their own tools, 


Startups need their own tools, different from those used in existing companies



Lesson 3
The 3 Tools For Startups


Startup Tool #1: Agile Engineering


Agile Engineering is How We Build Startups


Agile Engineering is the antithesis of Waterfall Development


Agile Engineering is the antithesis of Waterfall Development
It admits “We Cannot Know All the Features Customers Need”


Agile Engineering is the antithesis of Waterfall Development
It admits “We Cannot Know All the Features Customers Need”
So lets build iterative and incrementally 



Startup Tool #2: The Business Model


The Business Model:
Any company can be described in 9 building blocks


How can you describe your Business Model?

Startup Tool #3: Customer Development

Customer Development is How We Search for the Business Model


Lesson 4
Customer Development

Customer Development
There are no facts inside your building 
So get the heck out



Customer Development is how you search for the model
Search
Customer Discovery
Customer Validation
Pivot
Customer Creation
Company Building


Customer Development is how you search for the model

Customer Development is how you search for the model
Search
Customer Discovery
Customer Validation
Pivot
Customer Creation
Company Building
Execution
* Articulate and Test your hypotheses
* Design experiments, start listening
* Continuous Discovery
* Done by founders



Discovery
* How big is the market?
* Who’s the customer?
    * What’s their problem/need
* What’s the product/service/need?
    * Does it solve the customers problem?
* How do you create demand?
* How do you deliver the product?
* How do you make money?



Customer Development = process to search
Business Model Canvas = the Scorecard
Agile Engineering is How We Build Startups

 Background:  Graphene Applications
 “Wonder Material” Graphene
* Nano Material Subject of 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics 
* 2D Carbon:  Strong, Flexible, Conductive, Transparent
* Enables Next Generation Thin, Flexible Devices



 Problem:  Lab Scale Not Enough
 Graphene Production Must Scale Up to Commercial Levels before Integration into Consumer Products Becomes a Reality…


Solution:  Scalable Production Process
Our Patent-Pending   APCVD Graphene Production Process:
* Operates at ambient pressure, reducing cost enabling flexible design
* Industrial scale, continuous roll-to-roll production possible
* Graphene sheet size limited only by CVD furnace dimensions
* Same or better quality vis-à-vis LPCVD graphene
* Graphene growth at 900-1000 °C, lower than other methods


Market:  Size and Growth
Nascent Graphene Market is Ready to Explode: Commercial Scale Production will be  Catalyst
* Thin, Flexible Displays
* Solar Thin Film
* Touch Screens
* Thermal Management for Electronics
* Basic Materials and Research
* Microscopy (TEM) Sample Supports

2012 $52M 
Market for Graphene Films/Sheets
2016
* Thermal Management $6.4B
* Thin, Flexible Display $8.2B
* GF TAM: $1.2B
* Research/Mat’l/Other $1.4B
* Thin Film Solar $4.6B

Graphene Frontiers Process & Product Offering
  * GF APCVD Process will Accelerate Graphene Adoption Curve



Recap
* Graphene technology will change the world...
* ...but not until it is available in commercial volumes
* We believe that APCVD is the best path to industrial scale
* Whoever meets this challenge will be first mover in a fast growing market with multi-billion dollar potential
* We are the right team with the right technology to do it



Enter I-Corps:  Beginning Hypotheses
Here’s What We Thought:
  * Graphene can be used for just about anything
  * All of the big manufacturers are just waiting for our product
  * The market for graphene will explode in 2012
  * We will become the world’s largest graphene manufacturer

So Here’s What We Did…
* Research to identify target companies:  Build the list 
  * Web, industry/research reports, personal network, “Who else should we talk to?”
* Calls to personal/professional/alumni network:  	“Do you know anyone…?”
* Intros, warm calls, cold calls, cold calls, more calls


So Here’s What We Did…
* Google AdWords Campaign + Survey Monkey
  * 3 days, 8,555 Impressions, 34 people clicking through to our site, ZERO contacts/closes.  Retrospect:  What were we trying to learn???
* Serendipity:  Casual conversation turns to Graphene Frontiers at alumni event:

“That’s terrific! You know, I work at DuPont. Here’s my card… send me your deck and let me know how I can help.”  
 –Tom Connelly, Chief Innovation Officer, DuPont

Not all customers alike, even in identical verticals
Customer segmentation emerges: how they use, evaluate, buy, manage
Value proposition and pricing vary by customer use, metric
Openness to new technology, speed of piloting become key issues
Focused Segment strategy; Value Prop varies by segment
Focus on <8 hours of grid/day, extreme temperature climates
Segment said “recharge rate” important to value proposition
Energy produced per day a key Value Proposition in this market

Cold Storage “Niche” for Durathon™ ?
One battery vs Three to Four Batteries
Pb-acid
3 – 6*  batteries per 24 hour truck
NaMx
1.5 batteries per 24 hour truck
24/7 warehouse operators
Typical battery charging station Acid spill containment not shown.

*Freezer operations require 4~6 Pb acid batteries / truck, but only 1.5 Durathon batteries per truck !!

Value Propositions
‘Need-to-have’s
Detects specific species (typically ratio of species)
Sufficient kinetics and sensitivity
Signal reliability (no false positives/negatives)
Wireless (if high volumes)
User interface (if software)
Visualization of data
Can be display on sensor or even warning LEDs
Sensor lifetimes matching replacement cycle of another more crucial part
‘Nice-to-have’s
Extreme kinetics and sensitivity
Wireless (if low volumes)
Low-cost
Extremely Long-lasting
Detection of other species
Low-power
Minimum viable product:
It only has to work, and be easy to use
