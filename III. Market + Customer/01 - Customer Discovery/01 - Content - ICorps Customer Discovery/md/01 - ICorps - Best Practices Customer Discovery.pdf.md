3. You don’t know who your customer are!

* You haven’t talked to enough people*
  * So you don’t know
* “They” haven’t thought outside of their own box
  * So they don’t know
* Things change
  * So what you know isn’t what you need to know


Remember
More startups fail from a lack of customers than from a failure of product development

9 Guesses



The world doesn’t care if you have…
The best technology
The best plan
The best team



The world DOES care if you/it:
* Provide value (value proposition)
* To me (customer segment)
* From a source I trust (customer relationship)
* At a price that makes sense (revenue)


“In general, we look for a new law by following process. First, we guess…”
Richard Feynman


“It doesn’t matter how beautiful you theory is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If it doesn’t agree with experiment, it’s wrong.”
Richard Feynman


Why 70?
* Data drive results
* Testable hypotheses can be hard to formulate (remember QRST) and test
* Pattern analysis and recognition
* Information, not affirmation



Tactics
* Hypothesize
* Test – Interviews
* Assess & Analyze
* Adjust – Pivot


GET OUT
OF
THE BUILDING!!!
Your comfort zone



Who?
* Hypothesize about an archetype
* Talk to strangers
* Ask for 15 minutes, settle for 45
* Be honest with yourself – Listen, Don’t Talk


Where Do I Find My Archetypes?


How Do I Make Contact?
* Target the #2 ranked companies – “We try harder”
* Target mid-level management
  * They understand the company, products and needs
  * More likely to have the time and inclination to talk
* Cold call – but research your target ahead of time!
* Email, then call. Multiple touches using multiple modalities
* Play the ‘student’ card
* Network – get a warm intro



Remember


Customer Interviews (in reverse sequence)
Close
Do
Open
Get


1. Close

How to close an interview
* Ask what else you should ask
* Always thank them for their time
* Ask for references – who do they know who knows a lot about this, at least in comparison to you!
* Ask if you can check back if you have questions after the interview – like tomorrow, or next month
* Send a thank-you email. ALWAYS.
* Record your interaction in LPC (asap!)


How to do an interview Do


How to do an interview
* Introduce yourself
* Do not sell. In fact, don’t even describe your product!
* Tell the interviewee how useful their input wil be, and how important they are to you
* Remind them (and yourself!) that you are trying to learn
* Ask open ended questions – let them talk! 


What to ask in an interview
* Open ended questions
* Follow through on the answer – don’t be afraid to drill down!


Open Endedness…
Can you explain?
How? What do you mean?
When?
Is…?
Do you think…?
Help me understand…?
Why?



Drilling down
* Stay on the subject
  * Tell me more about post-surgical follow up
* Ask open ended questions and for specifics
  * Can you elaborate? Describe a time when that happened? Why? How?
* If need be, re-frame the comment (or your question) to move in a specific direction
  * Wow, that sounds very upsetting for the patient and his kidney, but tell me more about post-surgical follow up procedures, in your experience?
* Keep them talking
  * Short, simple questions and prompts
* Use two or three brains at once
  * Someone asks/talks/thinks tactically, someone takes notes, someone thinks strategically
Stay on Target

Interviewing
* Have a goal: a few hypotheses to test for every interview
* Meet face to face, at least 2 of your team
* Email “interviews” or surveys do not count
* Be humble… ask for help
* DO NOT SELL!!!
* DO NOT TALK ABOUT YOUR TECHNOLOGY!!!
* Focus on their pains, not yours
* Ask open ended questions
* Ask ‘Why’
* Ask for specifics and about current events
* Embrace bad news



Remember in interviews:
* Be a fox:
* Not a faucet:


What you hear customers say:



3. Openings
* Thank you for taking time today. I know how busy you are!
* My name is Jimmie Thudpucker, and I am at UCLA working on this project. This is my team mate Brunhilda and…
* We are learning about post-surgical follow up processes, and [George Fonebone] told us that you are an expert on the topic.
* Can you tell us a bit about…
* I’m happy to tell you about what we do, but if you don’t mind – we don’t want to take up to much time with it. We can discuss it at the end if you are interested!




4. Setting up interviews

* Introduce yourself using your ‘natural appeal’ – Mayo, student in a program, just learning, change the world someday, would like help, you da best
* Ask for 10 minutes, settle for 45
* Tell them how much they can help
* Be referred!
* Assume that you will be referred
* Email and phone are more effective than either one alone. In person is best!
* Schedule in advance
* Linked in, Facebook, Conference minutes/summaries, corporate sites, publications, key word searches
* Conferences



Keep in mind
* It’s all about them – not about you
* You will hear things you don’t like
* Opinions are like [clarinet notes]: they are just a bunch of wind before you ‘hear’ the tune
* It’s not science… it’s pattern recognition
* You don’t know anything until it dawns on you (around interview 60, typically)


Customer Interviews are all about Pattern Recognition


The Trap
CONFIRMATION BIAS


Customer Discovery Failure Modes
* Low interview counts
* Talking to people like yourself
* Only good news from an interview
* Technical interviews



Customer Discovery Best Practices
* Use the scientific method: hypothesize, test, reject/modify, re-test
* Hypotheses must be falsifiable, and the inverse must not be ridiculous
* Avoid validation
* Be specific
* Confirm with the negative

Facts are interesting. Insights are valuable
