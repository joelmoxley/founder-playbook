1	 Executive Summary
This Market Requirements Document (MRD) focuses on describing the market problem, market opportunity, and the resulting market requirements that help design a solution that addresses the market problem and realizes the market opportunity.
[Write an executive summary. Provide a concise report of the pertinent facts, assumptions, and suggestions noted throughout this document.]
<Comment: This document is typically presented to Engineering for solution planning and design. This section is the last section to filled-in and is to be done once the MRD is complete. Focus on the key elements in each document section and do not exceed two pages. The executive summary is a miniature version of the entire document. > 
2	Business Opportunity
This section describes the market problem and resulting market opportunity.

2.2	Market Problem
[Identify and justify the specific market problem. Explain any interlinking market problems.]
<Comment:  The market problem is a "consumer", "product", or "technology" problem in the target market. The market problem is essentially a situation (difficulty) that exists in the target market and requires change.
•	Consumer Problem - a marketplace situation in which the consumer's needs remain unsatisfied (business-to-consumer, B2C). The solution to a consumer problem is a whole product.
•	Product Problem - An industry situation in which the product requirements are unmet (business-to-business, B2B).
•	Technology Problem - Challenges in applied science. The solution to a technology problem is scientific research.>
