Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers
 
Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, authorizes a corporation, under certain circumstances, to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that the person is or was an officer or director of such corporation, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. With respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such indemnification is available if he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
 
Section 145 of the DGCL permits a corporation to include in its charter documents, and in agreements between the corporation and its directors and officers, provisions expanding the scope of indemnification beyond that specifically provided by the current law.
 
The Registrant’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for the indemnification of directors to the fullest extent permissible under Delaware law.
 
The Registrant’s amended and restated by-laws, which will be effective upon the completion of this offering, provide for the indemnification of officers, directors and third parties acting on the Registrant’s behalf if such persons act in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the Registrant’s best interest, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such indemnified party had no reason to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
 
The Registrant is entering into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provisions provided for in its charter documents, and the Registrant intends to enter into indemnification agreements with any new directors and executive officers in the future.
 
II-1
The underwriting agreement (to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto) will provide for indemnification by the underwriters, severally and not jointly, of the Registrant, its directors and its officers who sign this Registration Statement with respect to losses arising from misstatements or omissions in the Registration Statement or prospectus with reference to information relating to such underwriters furnished to the Registrant in writing by such underwriters expressly for use herein.
 
The Registrant intends to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer against any loss arising from any claim asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in that capacity, subject to certain exclusions and limits of the amount of coverage.

The issuance of securities described above in paragraphs (1) through (10) were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and/or Regulation S promulgated thereunder, and as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. The purchasers of the securities in these transactions represented that they were acquiring the securities for investment only and not with a view toward the public sale or distribution thereof. Such purchasers received written disclosures that the securities had not been registered under the Securities Act and that any resale must be made pursuant to a registration statement or an available exemption from registration. All purchasers either received adequate financial statement or non-financial statement information about the Registrant or had adequate access, through their relationship with the Registrant, to financial statement or non-financial statement information about the Registrant. The sale of these securities was made without general solicitation or advertising.
 
The issuance of securities described above in paragraphs (11) and (12) were exempt from registration under the Securities Act, in reliance on Rule 701, Section 4(2) and/or Regulation S of the Securities Act, pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or agreements approved by the Registrant’s board of directors.
 
All certificates representing the securities issued in these transactions described in this Item 15 included appropriate legends setting forth that the securities had not been offered or sold pursuant to a registration statement and describing the applicable restrictions on transfer of the securities. There were no underwriters employed in connection with any of the transactions set forth in this Item 15.
 
Item 16. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules
 
(a) Exhibits.
 
The exhibits to the registration statement are listed in the Exhibit Index to this registration statement and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
(b) Financial Statement Schedule.
 
All schedules have been omitted because they are not applicable.

Item 17. Undertakings
 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
 
The Registrant hereby undertakes that:
 
(a) The Registrant will provide to the underwriters at the closing as specified in the underwriting agreement, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.
 
(b) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.
 
(c) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
