SUMMARY
This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, including the risks discussed under “Risk Factors” and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus before making an investment decision. In this prospectus, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, “Comverge,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Comverge, Inc. and its predecessors and subsidiaries.
Company Overview
We are a clean energy company providing peaking and base load capacity to electric utilities, grid operators and associated electricity markets. As an alternative to the traditional method of providing capacity by building a new power plant, we deliver our capacity through implementation of demand management solutions that decrease energy consumption. The capacity we deliver is more environmentally friendly and less expensive than conventional alternatives and has the benefit of increasing overall system reliability. Our solutions are designed, built and operated for the benefit of our customers, which include electric utilities and grid operators that serve residential, commercial and industrial consumers. We provide capacity to our customers either through long-term contracts where we actively manage demand or by selling our demand response systems to utilities that operate them. We believe we are the largest provider of capacity through these means, as we currently own or manage approximately 1,445 megawatts of capacity.
We serve the clean energy market through three operating units, the Alternative Energy Resources Group, the Enerwise Group and the Smart Grid Solutions Group. Through our Alternative Energy Resources Group, we offer outsourced services, including our Virtual Peaking Capacity, or VPC, programs, as well as our base load capacity programs, which provide electric capacity to our customers. We provide this capacity by developing, operating and managing residential, commercial and industrial energy load management systems through long-term, pay-for-performance contracts. Our VPC programs provide electric capacity during periods of peak energy demand by remotely operating high energy-consuming devices, such as central air conditioners, electric water heaters and pool pumps. Our recent acquisition of Public Energy Solutions, LLC and its related entities, which we refer to as PES, also allows us to offer permanent base load reduction programs for commercial and industrial customers under long-term, pay-for-performance contracts with a utility. We refer to our seven VPC contracts and our base load reduction program collectively as our capacity contracts.
Our Enerwise Group, which was formed through our recent acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc., or Enerwise, significantly increases our ability to pursue and acquire an expansive set of large commercial and industrial consumers with our energy management and demand response solutions. The Enerwise Group allows consumers to participate in regional demand response programs offered by various Independent System Operators, or ISOs, energy efficiency upgrades and energy management solutions. By participating in our programs, consumers realize benefits through better management of their energy expenditures thereby creating excess capacity. The electric grid benefits from our programs by utilizing this excess capacity to improve efficiency and reliability. The opportunity to sell excess capacity to the ISO creates additional value for both the consumer and the ISO.
Our Smart Grid Solutions Group develops state-of-the-art demand response and smart metering technologies, and other hardware and software solutions that utilize wireless communications. These products allow our utility customers to measure, manage, shift and reduce energy consumption in real time. Our Smart Grid Solutions Group provides products that are integral to our Alternative Energy Resource and Enerwise solutions.

Our customer base includes over 70 Fortune 500 companies and over 500 utilities and energy service companies, including many of the largest utilities in North America. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had two customers that accounted for 28% and 16% of total revenues. Our top ten utility customers accounted for 78% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. Strong acceptance of our existing capacity programs and innovative smart grid products and services have led to long-term contracts with our customers that, as of November 30, 2007, represent approximately $289 million in estimated payments through 2017. As of November 30, 2007, our long-term contracts from the Smart Grid Solutions Group and the Alternative Energy Resources Group represent approximately $47 million and $242 million, respectively, in estimated payments through 2017. We have not included payments our Enerwise Group will receive from selling capacity in power pool programs because such contracts are not long-term contractual arrangements. Estimated payments from long-term contracts are subject to a number of assumptions and risks, as discussed under “Payments from Long-Term Contracts” beginning on page 6 of this summary.
Our revenues have increased from $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and our revenues have increased from $12.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2006 to $20.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2007. Even though our revenues have increased, we have incurred annual net losses in each period since inception and may continue to incur annual net losses in the future. Revenues for our Smart Grid Solutions Group were $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and $13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. Revenues for our Alternative Energy Resources Group were $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, which excludes revenues from our VPC contracts that we expect to recognize in the fourth quarter of 2007. Revenues for our Enerwise Group, which was acquired in July 2007, were $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. Our revenues for each of the last seven quarters were as follows (unaudited):

Market Opportunities
In North America, it is estimated that, by 2030, electric utilities will need to spend approximately $300 billion on the energy infrastructure, which includes power generation, transmission and distribution, alternative energy resources and energy efficiency products. The clean energy sector has evolved in direct response to the needs of electric utilities to pursue alternative forms of energy and to better manage the production and consumption of electricity. We estimate that the total clean energy market in which we participate is $7.4 billion annually. We define the clean energy sector as being comprised of three segments: alternative energy resources, smart grid technology, and conservation and efficiency. Alternative energy resources refers to alternatives to fossil fuel-based methods of providing electric capacity, including demand response and other resources that do not create harmful emissions. Smart grid technology refers to the application of advanced technology, including

wireless communications, for managing electricity production, delivery and consumption over a transmission and distribution network. Conservation and efficiency refers to the economic practice of reducing the use of energy. The key drivers for the expenditures in the electric utility industry include:
 
 	•	 	
transmission and distribution constraints;

 
 	•	 	
aging infrastructure;

 
 	•	 	
insufficient generation assets to meet increasing energy demand;

 
 	•	 	
tightening reserve margins;

 
 	•	 	
high and volatile commodity prices;

 
 	•	 	
an increasing rate environment; and

 
 	•	 	
environmental and regulatory concerns.

These factors are likely to continue to put upward pressure on electricity prices and increase costs to consumers.
The increasing prevalence of Renewable Portfolio Standards, or RPS, is another key driver that creates additional market opportunities. According to the Energy Information Administration, electricity demand in the United States is expected to increase by over 40% by 2030. Alternative energy resources are positioned to be the fastest growing source of new generation from 2004 to 2030. Currently, 25 states and the District of Columbia have implemented RPS, which suggests that up to 60,000 megawatts of renewable generation may be in place by 2015. Of these states, ten have also included energy efficiency programs as a component of their RPS. Going forward, we expect more states to adopt RPS and for energy efficiency to become an increasingly important part of meeting these RPS objectives.
Comverge Competitive Strengths
Compelling Value Proposition to Electric Utilities and Consumers.    For electric utilities, we offer an attractive peak power solution that provides electric capacity that is as much as 40% less expensive to build and operate than a natural gas-fired peaking power plant. Currently, there are 150 proposed coal-fired power plants to be built in the United States at a total cost of approximately $137 billion. If those funds were invested into energy efficiency programs, they could reduce U.S. electricity demand by about 19% by 2025, obviating the need for additional coal plants. Our solution is also as much as 90% less expensive than other forms of alternative energy, such as solar, that require governmental subsidies in order to remain competitive. We create additional value for electric utilities by reducing peak-time power spikes and improving grid reliability. Our technology also provides residential, commercial and industrial consumers with the ability to conserve energy and reduce their electricity costs through the implementation of energy efficiency and programs. This further enhances the ability of electric utilities to build fewer power plants and conserve capital resources.
A Market Leader in the Clean Energy Sector.    From inception through September 30, 2007, we have delivered residential demand response equipment with an equivalent capacity of approximately 6,000 megawatts, which is enough to provide electricity for six million homes. In 2006, we supplied residential demand response equipment representing approximately 134 megawatts of the residential demand response equipment shipped in North America in 2006. Based on public requests for proposals, we believe we supplied over 50% of the residential demand response equipment shipped in North America in 2006. We believe we are the only provider of demand response programs across all classes of energy consumers: residential, commercial and industrial. Our capacity contracts with electric utilities, which exclude The Connecticut Light and Power Company contract represent a total of approximately 529 megawatts of contracted capacity. Through our Enerwise offerings that
 
 
3
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

enable commercial and industrial energy consumers to participate in capacity programs with grid operators, we currently manage approximately 486 megawatts of additional capacity.
First-Mover Advantage in Pay-for-Performance Programs.    We are the first company to provide residential VPC programs to electric utilities. We believe that we are the only provider of outsourced demand response programs across all consumer classes, including residential, commercial and industrial. Currently, we operate six VPC contracts with electric utilities. For two of our earliest residential VPC contracts, in PacifiCorp’s Utah service territory and the San Diego Gas and Electric service territory, we have residential consumer participation of 28% and 13%, respectively. With our commercial consumers, we have attained 11% participation in all VPC programs as of December 31, 2006. We also manage approximately 486 megawatts of capacity through our Enerwise offerings that enable commercial and industrial energy consumers to participate in capacity programs with grid operators. We are aware of only one other significant provider of outsourced programs focused on large commercial and industrial consumers. Our first-mover advantage has proved beneficial as we leverage our experience with our broad demand response base across all classes of energy consumers, including commercial, industrial and residential. We believe that we are one of only a few companies that has been successful implementing and simultaneously operating multiple programs. As a result, we have gained significant operational expertise in program implementation, measurement and verification, and customer service, which has provided us a distinct competitive advantage.
Portfolio Approach to Addressing the Market.    Through our three business units, we are uniquely positioned to provide demand response and energy efficiency solutions to all classes of energy consumers. We are able to do this through outsourced offerings whereby we manage and operate these programs, or through the sale of advanced tools, enabling utilities and commercial and industrial consumers to deploy and manage these programs internally. This also allows our utility customers to choose whether they would like to acquire the asset as part of their capital expenditure programs, or whether they provide us payment solely on the basis of the services we supply. When we maintain ownership of the asset upon the completion of the initial contract terms, we are then able to re-use the asset in other contracts with no additional capital or installation cost. An emerging business model is based on the customer’s ability to sell its capacity into an open market program established by the ISO. We have demonstrated success in providing tools and management services to our customers, allowing them to access these market opportunities by selling their excess capacity.
Ability to Address the Large and Growing Clean Energy Sector.    Our products and services increase available electric capacity through reduced energy consumption, are broadly deployed and provide an immediate solution to electric utilities on a cost-effective and environmentally friendly basis. We have a broad portfolio of solutions, based on state-of-the-art technology, that enables us to address the needs of all segments of the growing clean energy sector. Based on an UtiliPoint International report, over 50% of U.S. utilities and 71% of Canadian utilities are planning to expand their demand response initiatives. Accordingly, we believe that a large market opportunity remains within North America in which to expand our products and services. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant portion of the large and growing clean energy sector. We estimate that our total addressable market in the clean energy sector is approximately $7.4 billion annually.
Long-Term Contracts Provide Significant Recurring Revenues.    We have a variety of long-term contracts in both our Alternative Energy Resources Group and Smart Grid Solutions Group, including contracts for equipment sales, services and capacity programs. These contracts range from three to 20 years and provide us a stable and growing source of recurring revenues. Revenues derived from long-term contracts have become a larger portion of our business, growing from 30% in 2004 to 65% in 2006. These contracts have usual and customary provisions that allow us or our utility customers to terminate them for cause, and some contracts allow our utility customers to terminate them for convenience; however, no customers have terminated their contracts to date.

We will continue to invest in research and development efforts in our operating groups and capture operational and technical knowledge gained from the deployment of our capacity programs and Enerwise solutions. This will enable us to develop new and innovative solutions to better serve our existing customer base and to appeal to new customers. We believe that this investment will allow us to realize new revenue opportunities and decrease our operating costs, thereby enabling us to remain competitive and to maintain our leading market position.
Pursue Targeted Strategic Opportunities.    We intend to pursue acquisitions and strategic relationships to strengthen our competitive position in the clean energy sector. This sector is comprised of a number of companies with niche offerings or customer relationships, which provide attractive acquisition opportunities. Other opportunities may include acquisitions of alternative energy companies that could benefit from our development expertise in outsourced programs.
Payments from Long-Term Contracts
As of November 30, 2007, we had entered into long-term contracts with thirteen of our utility customers that represent approximately $289 million in estimated payments to us from 2007 to 2017. Eight of these utilities have entered into long-term capacity contracts, and five have entered into hardware or service long-term supply contracts. The payments estimated from long-term contracts have been prepared by management and are based upon the contractual terms and a number of assumptions, including:
 
 	•	 	
the timely completion of the build-out of our capacity programs;

 
 	•	 	
the rate of replacement of participant terminations under our capacity contracts remaining consistent with our historical average;

 
 	•	 	
our ability to provide to our utility customers the maximum available capacity under our capacity contracts once build-out is completed; and

 
 	•	 	
our contracts not being terminated, modified or delayed.

Any differences among these assumptions, other factors and our actual experiences may result in actual payments in future periods significantly differing from management’s current estimates of payments allowed under the long-term contracts and our actual expenses may result in actual payments collected being significantly lower than current estimates. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not receive the payments anticipated by our long-term contracts and recognize revenues from our backlog, and comparisons of period-to-period estimates are not necessarily meaningful, may not be indicative of actual payments and should not be relied upon.” A comparison of payments from long-term contracts from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual payments and should not be relied upon. You should read our “Payments from Long-Term Contracts” information together with our historical financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this prospectus and together with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” particularly the section entitled “Payments from Long-Term Contracts.” In management’s view, such information was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and, to management’s knowledge and belief, presents the assumptions and considerations on which we base our belief that we can receive such payments. The information in this section is designed to summarize the financial terms of our long-term contracts and is not intended to provide guidance on future operating results, including revenues or profitability.
Challenges
The following challenges, as well as the other risks discussed in “Risk Factors,” should be carefully considered before participating in this offering:
 
 	•	 	
our history of annual net losses and our potential inability to receive the payments from long-term contracts and recognize revenues from our backlog;

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	•	 	
the potential requirement to make substantial refunds to our utility customers if the actual amount of electric capacity that we provide under our capacity contracts is materially less than estimated;

 
 	•	 	
the competition we face, including from companies with greater financial resources; and

 
 	•	 	
our dependence on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues.

Recent Developments
In May 2007, we executed a new VPC contract with Nevada Power Company to provide up to 123 megawatts of contracted capacity. Included in the VPC contract is the operation and maintenance of Nevada Power Company’s existing demand response system which is estimated to provide 21 megawatts of capacity. We refer to our operation of existing demand response systems as brownfield opportunities to grow our business.
In May 2007, the California Public Utilities Commission approved our previously announced Demand Response Purchase Agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company, or PG&E. Under the agreement, our VPC program will provide PG&E with up to 50 megawatts of electricity capacity in the first two years and up to 57 megawatts thereafter.
In June 2007, the California Public Utilities Commission approved our previously announced expansion of our Demand Response Capacity Delivery Agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric Company, or SDG&E, for an additional 30 megawatts of capacity. Under this VPC program, SDG&E will be provided with up to 100 megawatts of capacity.
In July 2007, we completed our acquisition of Enerwise. Enerwise is an energy infrastructure management, demand response and renewable energy services and technology provider that enables commercial and industrial customers to reduce energy consumption and total costs, improve energy infrastructure reliability and make informed decisions on energy and renewable energy purchases and programs.
In August 2007, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approved our previously announced Demand Response Purchase Agreement with the Public Service Company of New Mexico. Under the agreement, our VPC program will provide the Public Service Company of New Mexico with up to 20, 31 and 45 megawatts of capacity during the first, second and third years of the program, respectively, and up to 62 megawatts of capacity thereafter.
In September 2007, we completed our acquisition of PES. PES is an energy efficiency company that implements permanent base load reduction solutions for commercial and industrial customers under long-term, pay-for-performance contracts with a utility.
In October 2007, we executed a new VPC contract with Southern California Edison Company to provide up to 50 megawatts of capacity. The program is subject to approval by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California.
In October 2007, we executed an agreement with Tampa Electric Company to expand the Energy Planner program utilizing our Maingate Home system to provide an estimated 12 megawatts of demand response capacity over three years.
In October 2007, we executed a new VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to provide up to 130 megawatts of capacity. Previously, we operated two VPC contracts with ISO New England Inc. that provided 60 megawatts of capacity, in the aggregate, which expired on October 1, 2007, per their original contractual terms. We expect a portion of the 60 megawatts of capacity idled upon the expiration of the ISO New England Inc. contracts will be redeployed to fulfill the contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company if the contract receives regulatory approval. Alternatively, we may choose to deploy these idled assets in an independent system operator auction.

In November 2007, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control denied approval of our VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company as submitted. We are working with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to extend the term of the agreement, which remains in effect, to allow the parties to amend and resubmit the contract in accordance with the parameters suggested by the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control. There is no guarantee that we will be able to agree on an amendment or ultimately receive regulatory approval.
As of November 30, 2007, excluding our Enerwise capacity, we had contracted capacity of approximately 529 megawatts, and we estimated that our total payments to be received from our Alternate Energy Resource Group’s contracts through 2017 were approximately $242 million.
We expect our fiscal 2007 revenues to be in a range from $50 million to $55 million, a year-over-year increase of approximately 55%, and our revenue growth rate to accelerate in 2008. We anticipate key drivers of our expected revenue growth in 2008 will be the contributions from our recent acquisitions of Enerwise and PES and the increase in our installed capacity as we build out our recent contract wins. As of September 30, 2007, we had installed 241 megawatts of capacity. As of November 30, 2007, we had approximately 529 megawatts under contract, which contribute to estimated payments of $289 million. When we refer to the megawatts of contracted capacity, or estimated payments associated with our VPC contracts or our capacity contracts, we exclude any megawatts or payments associated with our VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company.

(2)	 	In calculating diluted net income per share, the income numerator was increased by the interest expense savings and the amortization expense savings resulting from the assumed conversion of our convertible debt. The weighted average shares used in computing the diluted net income per share have been calculated assuming the conversion of our convertible debt as well as the conversion of all shares of convertible preferred stock, which were converted into shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering on April 18, 2007.
(3)	 	The pro forma as adjusted column gives effect to (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts):
 
 	•	 	
the sale of 800,000 shares of our common stock in this offering at the offering price of $31.48 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and the use of the proceeds as described under “Use of Proceeds;”

 
 	•	 	
The use of $23,116 in cash, net of cash acquired, and the issuance of $17,000 in subordinated convertible notes payable and $36,871 in common stock to complete the acquisition of Enerwise in July 2007; and

 
 	•	 	
The use of $9,291 in cash, net of cash acquired, and the issuance of $3,000 in subordinated convertible notes payable and $1,121 in common stock to complete the acquisition of PES in September 2007.

 
(4)	 	EBITDA is defined as net loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for other GAAP financial measures such as net loss, operating loss or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP. In addition, our calculation of EBITDA may or may not be consistent with that of other companies. We urge you to review the GAAP financial measures included in this prospectus and our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, and the other financial information contained in this prospectus, and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
EBITDA is a common alternative measure of performance used by investors, financial analysts and rating agencies to assess operating performance for companies in our industry. Depreciation is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue. We do not believe that this expense is indicative of our core operating performance because the depreciable lives of assets vary greatly depending on the maturity terms of our VPC contracts, which range from three to 13 years. The clean energy sector has experienced recent

trends of increased growth and new company development, which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital (which affect interest expense). Management views interest expense as a by-product of capital structure decisions and, therefore, it is not indicative of our core operating performance. Our internal budgets are based on EBITDA, and we use EBITDA as one of several criteria to determine performance-based cash compensation.
A reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA for each of the fiscal periods indicated is as follows (in thousands):

Use of non-GAAP financial measures is subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment of which charges should properly be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure. Management accounts for these limitations by not relying exclusively on non-GAAP financial measures, but only using such information to supplement GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from such measures used by other companies.
 
(5)	 	Contracted capacity represent the maximum amount of megawatts of electric capacity that can be provided under our capacity contracts.
(6)	 	The terms installed capacity and built-out megawatts generally refer to the number of devices installed multiplied by the historically highest demonstrated available capacity provided per device for the applicable service territory.
(7)	 	Available capacity represents the amount of electric capacity that we have made available to our customers during each contract year based on the results of our measurement and verification process. We report available capacity in the fourth quarter of each year.

RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the notes thereto and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The risks described below are those that we believe are the material risks that we face. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose a part or all of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business
We have incurred annual net losses since our inception, and we may continue to incur annual net losses in the future.
Our annual net loss in 2005 and 2006 was $8.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively and our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $14.2 million and $12.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. Our accumulated deficit from inception through September 30, 2007, was $66.4 million. Initially, our net losses were driven principally by start-up costs and the costs of developing our technology. More recently, our net losses have been driven principally by general and administrative, marketing, operating and depreciation expenses relating to capital expenditures for equipment required to support our capacity programs. To grow our revenues and customer base, we plan to continue emphasizing the expansion and development of our capacity programs, which will include increased marketing and operating expenses. In the short-term, our success in operating our capacity contracts would have a negative effect on earnings because of the consumer acquisition costs we incur during the installation phase of the contract. These increased costs may cause us to incur net losses in the foreseeable future, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our revenues and expand our client base to become profitable. Furthermore, these expenses are not the only factors that may contribute to our net losses. For example, interest expense on our currently outstanding debt and any debt we incur in the future will contribute to our net losses. As a result, even if we significantly reduce our marketing or operating expenses, we may continue to incur net losses in the future.
We may not receive the payments anticipated by our long-term contracts and recognize revenues from our backlog, and comparisons of period-to-period estimates are not necessarily meaningful, may not be indicative of actual payments and should not be relied upon.
Payments from long-term contracts represent our estimate of the total payments that our contracts allow us to receive over the course of long-term agreements in our Smart Grid Solutions and Alternative Energy Resources Groups. Our estimated payments from these long-term contracts are based on a number of assumptions. The expectations regarding our Smart Grid Solutions Group’s annual and multi-year contracts include assumptions relating to purchase orders received, contractual minimum order volumes and purchase orders that we expect to receive under a contract if it is extended based on amounts and timing of historical purchases. We also assume that we will be able to meet our obligations under these contracts on a timely basis. The expectations regarding the build-out of our capacity contracts are based on our experience to date in building out the load management systems. Our estimated payments from long-term contracts as of November 30, 2007, assumes that we will build out the approximately 337 megawatts remaining under our VPC and base load capacity contracts by the end of 2010. If we are not able to meet this build-out schedule, we have higher than expected withdrawal by consumers from our programs or if the measurement and verification results are lower than expected, we may not be able to receive the full amount of estimated payments from long-term contracts. Additionally, one of our VPC contracts gives us the option to increase or decrease our contractual capacity at various times during the agreement and, although we cannot guarantee that we will elect to increase, we have assumed in this prospectus that we will increase the contracted capacity to the maximum permitted under the contract. We assume that we will operate our capacity contracts at their maximum contractual capacity for the remainder of the term once full build-out is completed and that the payments resulting from our measurement

and verification tests performed each contract year, as discussed below, will remain constant based on our current performance. We also assume that we will not be required to pay any penalties under these contracts, whether for liquidated damages or otherwise, that no contracts will be terminated for convenience or other reasons by our customers and that the rate of replacement of participant terminations under our capacity contracts will remain consistent with our historical average. Finally, we assume that we will receive all regulatory approvals necessary to commence the programs under contracts that have not received regulatory approval. Changes in our estimates or any of these assumptions, the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, the number of digital control units installed, changes in our measurement and verification test results and payments, contracts being rescheduled, cancelled or renewed, disputes as to actual capacity provided, or new contracts being signed before existing contracts are completed, and other factors, may result in actual payments from long-term contracts being significantly lower than estimated payments from long-term contracts. A comparison of estimated payments from long-term contracts from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual payments and should not be relied upon.
In November 2007, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control denied regulatory approval of our VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company, as submitted. The VPC contract will terminate by its terms on December 15, 2007 if we are unable to reach an agreement with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to extend the agreement’s term. While we are working with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to amend the agreement, there is no guarantee we will do so before December 15, 2007. Even if we amend and resubmit the agreement for approval by the Connecticut Department of Utility Control, there is no assurance that we will receive regulatory approval.
Our backlog represents our estimate of revenues from firm commitments, including purchase orders and long-term contracts, that we expect to recognize over the course of the next 12 months. The inaccuracy of any of our estimates and other factors may result in actual results being significantly lower than estimated under our reported backlog. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenues and should not be relied upon.
We operate in highly competitive markets; if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and revenues.
We face strong competition from traditional clean energy providers, both larger and smaller than us, from advanced metering infrastructure equipment and energy service providers. Advanced metering infrastructure systems generally include advanced meter reading with a demand response component, including a communications infrastructure. Energy service providers typically provide expertise to utilities and end-use customers relating to energy audits, demand reduction or energy efficiency measures. We also compete against traditional supply-side resources such as natural gas-fired power plants and independent power producers. Our principal clean energy competitors are Ameresco Energy Services Company, ConEd Solutions, Inc. (a subsidiary of ConEd, Inc.), ConsumerPowerline Inc., Cooper Power Systems, Inc. (through its subsidiary Cannon Technologies, Inc.), Corporate Systems Engineering, EnergyConnect, Inc., Energy Curtailment Specialists, Inc., EnerNOC, Inc., ESCO Technologies, Inc. (through its DCSI Division), GoodCents Solutions, Inc., Honeywell International, Inc. (and its subsidiary Honeywell Utilities Solutions), Hunt Technologies, Inc., SmartSynch Inc. and Trilliant Group, Inc. In addition, some providers of advanced meter reading products, such as Itron, Inc. and ESCO Technologies, Inc. (through its DCSI Division), may add demand response products or energy services to their existing business, and other such providers may elect to add similar offerings in the future. Further, energy service providers, such as Constellation Inc., Reliant Energy Inc. and Suez Energy North America, Inc. may add their own demand response solutions, which could decrease our base of potential customers and could decrease our revenues and profitability.
Some of the aforementioned energy service and advanced metering infrastructure providers are substantially larger and better capitalized than us and have the ability to combine (1) advanced meter reading or commodity sales and (2) demand response products into an integrated offering to a large existing customer base. Because many of our target customers already purchase either advanced meter reading, energy efficiency products or services, demand response products or services, or commodities from one or more of our competitors, our success depends on our ability to attract target customers away from their existing providers or to partner with one or more of these entities to distribute our products. In addition, the target market for our capacity programs

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

has been composed largely of “early adopters,” or customers who have sought out new technologies and services. Because the number of early adopters is limited, our continued growth will depend on our success in marketing and selling our capacity programs to mainstream customers in our target markets. Larger competitors could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competing business model that may be more attractive to potential customers than what we offer. Competitors who also provide advanced metering infrastructure or energy services may offer such services at prices below cost or even for free in order to improve their competitive positions. In addition, because of the other services that our competitors provide, they may choose to offer clean energy services as part of a bundle that includes other products, such as residential advanced meter reading and automated invoicing, which we do not offer. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenues.
Some of our strategic alliances are not exclusive, and accordingly, the companies with whom we have strategic alliances may in the future elect to compete with us by developing and selling competing products and services. In addition, these companies have similar, and often more established, relationships with our customers, and may recommend other products and services to their customers instead of our products and services.
The significant competition in our industry has resulted in increasingly aggressive pricing, and we anticipate that prices may continue to decrease. We believe that in some instances our prices are currently higher than those of our competitors for similar solutions. Users of our solutions may switch to another clean energy provider based on price, particularly if they perceive the quality of our competitors’ products to be equal to or better than that of our products. Continued price decreases by our competitors could result in a loss of customers or a decrease in the growth of our business, or it may require us to lower our prices to remain competitive, which would result in reduced revenues and lower profit margins and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and delay or prevent our future profitability.
If we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.
In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005, and the six months ended June 30, 2006, our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. There were no material weaknesses identified by our independent registered accounting firm during the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Our management and independent registered public accounting firm did not perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Control deficiencies have been identified by management and our independent registered public accounting firm during the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, which may give rise to one or more material weaknesses in future periods. Our material weaknesses have been remediated as a result of having taken various measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Notwithstanding this remediation, material weaknesses may exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for purposes of our reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
As part of our business strategy, we plan to pursue the acquisition of complimentary businesses. Once we acquire a new business, we must integrate the accounting system for the business with our own, and we may experience challenges in our internal control over financial reporting as a result. Any such difficulty we encounter could increase the risk of a material weakness. Specifically, we anticipate integrating the accounting systems of both Enerwise and PES with our own and improving these systems to ensure proper reporting. Enerwise and PES were both private companies prior to the acquisitions and did not maintain internal control and financial reporting

systems that are equivalent to those of a public company. Although we have not experienced any material difficulties to date, we may experience challenges integrating the accounting systems of Enerwise and PES, or integration may take longer than expected, which may result in significant deficiencies or the reporting of one or more material weaknesses in our Annual Report in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.
The existence of one or more material weaknesses in any period precludes a conclusion that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Such conclusion would be required to be disclosed in our future Annual Reports on Form 10-K and may impact the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting and the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting.
We could be required to make substantial refunds or pay damages to power pools or our utility customers if the actual amount of electric capacity we provide under our capacity programs is materially less than estimated under the applicable agreements.
We typically operate our capacity programs through long-term, fixed price contracts with our utility customers. Under our base load contracts, our utility customers make periodic payments based on verified load reduction after inspecting and confirming the capacity reduced through energy efficiency measures. While this base load is able to be permanently reduced once the energy efficiency devices are installed and verified, the utility often retains the right to conduct follow up inspections for subsequent years. If the energy consumer removes the installed devices, shuts down operations or vacates the physical premises, there is the potential that any subsequent inspection by our utility customer would result in a lower amount of base load reduced capacity than originally verified, which may consequently obligate us to pay a penalty.
Under our power pool auction contracts, which typically have a term of one to three years, we sell capacity that we obtain through our programs to power pools. Under these power pool contracts, the power pool makes periodic payments to us based on estimates of the amount of electric capacity that we expect to make available to them during the contract year. We refer to these payments as proxy payments and electric capacity on which proxy payments are made as estimated capacity. A contract year generally begins on June 1 and ends May 31 of the following year. During the fourth calendar quarter, we and the power pool analyze results of the metering data collected during the capacity events to determine the capacity that was available to the power pool during the actual event. Any discrepancy between our analysis of the metering data and the analysis from the power pool could result in lower than expected revenues or potential damages payable by us.
Under our VPC contracts, which typically have a term of five to ten years, our utility customers make periodic payments to us based on estimates of the amount of electric capacity we expect to make available to them during the contract year. We refer to these payments as proxy payments and electric capacity on which proxy payments are made as estimated capacity. During contract negotiations or the first contract year of a VPC program, estimated capacity is negotiated and established by the contract. A contract year generally begins at the end of the summer months, after a utility’s seasonal peak energy demand for electricity. We refer to this seasonal peak energy demand as the cooling season. For example, the cooling season for one of our VPC contracts runs from June 1 to August 31, and the contract year for this agreement begins on September 1 and ends on August 31. During the fourth calendar quarter, we and our utility customers analyze results of measurement and verification tests that are performed during the cooling season of each contract year to statistically determine the capacity that was available to the utility during the cooling season. We refer to measured and verified capacity as our available capacity. This available capacity also establishes the estimated capacity per device, which we generally refer to as our M&V factor, for that contract year. During each succeeding contract year, we generally receive proxy payments based on the prior year’s M&V factor and installed devices in the applicable service territory.
Available capacity varies with the electricity demand of high-use energy equipment, such as central air conditioning compressors, at the time measurement and verification tests are conducted, which, in turn, depends on factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Although our contracts often contain restrictions regarding the time of day and, in some cases, the day of the week the measurement and
 
17
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

verification tests are performed, the actual time within the agreed testing period that the tests are performed is beyond our control. If the measurement and verification tests are performed during a period of generally lower electricity usage, then the capacity made available through our system could be lower than estimated capacity for the particular contract being tested. The correct operation of, and timely communication with, devices used to control equipment are also important factors that affect available capacity under our power pool and VPC contracts. Any difference between our available capacity and the estimated capacity on which proxy payments were previously made will result in either a refund payment from us to our utility customer or an additional payment to us by our customer. We refer to this process that results in a final settlement as a true-up. To date, we have received aggregate additional payments of $63,000, $2.2 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. In the future, we may not receive additional payments from such true-ups, but instead may be required to pay refunds. Refunds may be the result of a variety of factors, including climate, system performance, attrition or contractual terms. Based on preliminary measurement and verification results as of November 30, 2007, we may be required to pay refunds to at least one customer. Our deferred revenues set forth in this prospectus take into account our estimate of these potential refunds.
Any refund payments that we may be required to make (1) as a result of a subsequent inspection under our base load contracts, (2) to the power pool under our auction contracts, or (3) pursuant to a true-up settlement determination under our VPC contracts could be substantial and could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, because measurement and verification test results for each VPC contract establish estimated capacity on which proxy payments will be made for the following contract year, a downward adjustment in estimated capacity for a particular VPC contract would decrease the dollar amount of proxy payments for the following contract year and could significantly decrease our estimated backlog and estimated payments from long-term contracts. In addition, such adjustment could result in significant year-to-year variations in our quarterly and annual revenues. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue Recognition.”
A significant portion of our revenues are generated from contracts with a small number of electric utility customers, the postponement, modification or termination of which could significantly reduce our revenues.
Our revenues historically have been generated from a small number of electric utility customers. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, our top ten electric utility customers accounted for approximately 71%, 80% and 78% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. In 2006, we had two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues: ISO New England Inc. (28%) and PacifiCorp (16%). Our capacity contracts are multi-year contracts that are subject to postponement, modification or termination by our utility customers, including some that may be terminated for convenience. Such action by a customer with respect to one or more of our significant contracts would significantly reduce our revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 68% of our consolidated revenues and two customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues: PJM Interconnection (16%) and Gulf Power Company (12%).
The expiration of our capacity contracts without obtaining a renewal or replacement capacity contract, or finding another revenue source for the capacity our operating assets can provide, could materially affect our business.
Although we have entered into additional long-term contracts in different geographic regions and are regularly in discussions with our customers to extend our existing contracts or enter into new contracts with these existing customers, there can be no assurance that any of these contracts will be extended or that we will enter into new contracts on favorable terms. If these contracts are not extended or replaced, we would expect to enroll the capacity that we make available under such contracts in another demand response capacity program, although there is no assurance we would be able to do so. In addition, other programs could provide lower capacity payments than our existing fixed price contracts. Thus, the failure to renew any of these contracts could significantly reduce our revenues.

For example, we operated two VPC contracts with ISO New England Inc. that provided 60 megawatts of capacity, in the aggregate. ISO New England Inc. did not extend the contracts beyond their original expiration date of October 1, 2007. While we believe that we will utilize most of these assets in our contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company, if the contract is extended and receives regulatory approval, or will deploy them in an independent system operator auction, we will not be able to utilize all of the assets and may have some terminations from current residential participants.
We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions successfully, which may inhibit our rate of growth, and we may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses and acquisitions that we complete may expose us to a number of unanticipated operational or financial risks.
In addition to organic growth, we have pursued and intend to continue pursuing growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that may enable us to enlarge our geographic markets, add experienced management and increase our product and service offerings. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates or reach agreement on potential acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition efforts involve certain risks, including:
 
 	•	 	
difficulty integrating operations and systems;

 
 	•	 	
the potential for key personnel and customers of the acquired company terminating their relationships with the acquired company as a result of the acquisition;

 
 	•	 	
additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting;

 
 	•	 	
additional risks and liabilities (including for environmental-related costs) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not discover during our due diligence;

 
 	•	 	
disruption of our ongoing business or insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and

 
 	•	 	
realizing cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.

The rapid growth of the clean energy sector may cause us to experience more competition for acquisition opportunities, which could result in higher valuations for acquisition candidates. As a result, we may be required to pay more for acquisitions we believe are beneficial, which could, in turn, require us to recognize additional goodwill in connection with such acquisitions. To the extent that any acquisition results in additional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect on our credit. In addition, in the event that we issue shares of our common stock as part or all of the purchase price, an acquisition will dilute the ownership of our then-current stockholders. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, synergies or productivity comparable to those achieved by our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected. In addition, future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness and other expenses. There can be no assurance that our acquisition strategy will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to realize the anticipated synergies or expected revenue growth from our recent acquisitions of Enerwise and PES, we may experience difficulty integrating these businesses and we may incur significant cash integration costs.
In July 2007, we acquired Enerwise and in September 2007, we acquired PES. Integration of these businesses will require significant management time and corporate resources. While we have not experienced any material difficulties to date, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate these businesses with our own in a timely manner. In addition, as both Enerwise and PES were private companies prior to the acquisitions, integration of their accounting systems with our own may require significant time resources of our internal accounting team. We may incur significant cash integration costs to achieve anticipated growth and we cannot assure you that we will realize the cost savings, synergies or expected revenue growth from integration of these acquisitions or within the time frame we expect or at all.

We depend on the electric utility industry and associated power pool markets for revenues, and as a result, our operating results have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant variability due to volatility in electric utility capital spending or the power pool markets, and other factors affecting the electric utility industry.
We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of products and services, directly or indirectly, to the electric utility industry and power pool markets. In relation to our electric utility customers, purchases of our products or services by electric utilities may be deferred or cancelled as a result of many factors, including consolidation among electric utilities, changing governmental regulations, weather conditions, rising interest rates, reduced electric utility capital spending and general economic downturns. In addition, a significant amount of revenues generated by our Smart Grid Solutions Group is dependent on long-term relationships with our utility customers, which are not always supported by long-term contracts. These revenues are particularly susceptible to variability based on changes in the spending patterns of our utility customers.
The power pool markets in which we participate could be materially altered in ways that negatively affect our ability to participate and, in turn, result in decreased revenues. These markets typically utilize short-term contracts and often have price volatility. Prices in these markets typically fall whenever capacity providers place excessive amounts of capacity for auction in these markets. If prices decline below the point at which customers who typically participate in these programs recognize a benefit from participating or if they decide to participate with another provider, we would no longer be able to enroll these customers, which could result in us recognizing lower than expected revenues.
We have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant variability in our revenues, on both an annual and a quarterly basis, as a result of these factors. Pronounced variability in the power pool markets or an extended period of reduction in spending by electric utilities could negatively impact our business and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our future sales, which could lead to increased spending by us that is not matched with equivalent or better revenues.
Failure of key third parties to manufacture quality products or provide reliable services in a timely manner could cause malfunctions of our products or delays in the delivery of our products or services, which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our growth.
Our success depends on our ability to provide quality products and reliable services in a timely manner, which in part depends on the proper functioning of facilities and equipment owned and operated by third parties upon which we depend. For example, our reliance on third parties includes:
 
 	•	 	
utilizing components that they manufacture in our products;

 
 	•	 	
outsourcing cellular and paging wireless communications that are used to execute instructions to our (1) devices under our VPC programs and (2) clients in power pools;

 
 	•	 	
utilizing products that they manufacture for our various capacity programs or power pool program outsourcing certain installation, maintenance, data collection and call center operations to third-party providers; and

 
 	•	 	
buying capacity from third parties who have contracted with electricity consumers to participate in our VPC programs.

Any delays, malfunctions, inefficiencies or interruptions in these products, services or operations could adversely affect the reliability or operation of our products or services, which could cause us to experience difficulty retaining current customers and attracting new customers. In addition, our brand, reputation and growth could be negatively impacted. For example, in three separate circumstances prior to 2006, battery failures, microprocessor failures and cracks in plastic enclosures in certain of our Smart Grid products resulted in significant product recalls. The costs of remedying these component failures were only partially refundable by third-party suppliers. In each case, we believe that the recalls resulted in reduced customer satisfaction. Furthermore, we are wholly dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and delivery of our products,
 
20
Table of Contents

including one vendor with offshore facilities where our programmable thermostats are manufactured. In addition, one domestic vendor is responsible for manufacturing and assembling a majority of our products. In the event of a significant interruption in the manufacturing or delivery of our products by these vendors, considerable time, effort and expense could be required to establish alternate production lines at other facilities and our operations could be materially disrupted, which would cause us to not meet production deadlines and lose customers.
Our failure to meet product development and commercialization milestones may result in customer dissatisfaction, cancellation of existing customer orders or our failure to successfully compete in new markets.
In the past, we have not met all of our product development and commercialization milestones. For example, we are behind schedule in developing a next-generation demand response product for a major customer. This delay has resulted in a deferral of sales and gross profit associated with contracted delivery schedules for our products and is a source of customer dissatisfaction. In addition, we are behind schedule in developing a next-generation load management software product, resulting in a delay in the planned commercialization of this product.
We establish milestones to monitor our progress toward developing commercially feasible products or to meet contractual delivery requirements of our customers. In meeting these milestones, we often depend on third-party contractors in the U.S. and other countries for much of our hardware manufacturing and software development. Internal delays or delays by third-party contractors could cause us to miss product development or delivery deadlines. In addition, internal development delays could result in the loss of commercially available hardware and software products, as we are unable to rely on outside vendors to provide such products when contractual rights for the supply or license of such products expire. We may not successfully achieve our milestones in the future, which could distract our employees, harm our relationships with our existing and potential customers, and result in cancelled orders, deferred or lost revenues and our inability to successfully compete in new markets.
Any internal or external security breaches involving our products could harm our reputation, and even the perception of security risks, whether or not valid, could inhibit market acceptance of our products and cause us to lose customers.
Our customers use our products to compile and analyze sensitive or confidential information. The occurrence or perception of security breaches in our products or services could harm our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may come into contact with sensitive consumer information or data when we perform operational, support or maintenance functions for our utility customers. Even the perception that we have improperly handled sensitive, confidential information could have a negative effect on our business. If, in handling this information, we fail to comply with privacy or security laws, we could incur civil liability to government agencies, customers and individuals whose privacy is compromised. In addition, third parties may attempt to breach our security or inappropriately use our products through computer viruses, electronic break-ins and other disruptions. If a breach were successful, confidential information may be improperly obtained, and we may be subject to lawsuits and other liabilities. Any internal or external security breaches could harm our reputation, and even the perception of security risks, whether or not valid, could inhibit market acceptance of our products and cause us to lose customers.
If we lose key personnel upon whom we are dependent, we may not be able to manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives.
Many key responsibilities of our business have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. Our future success depends to a considerable degree on the vision, skills, experience and effort of our senior management team, including Robert M. Chiste, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; Michael D. Picchi, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank A. Magnotti, the President and Chief Operating Officer of our Alternative Energy Resources Group; Dean W. Musser, the President and Chief Operating Officer of our Enerwise Group; Edward J. Myszka, the President and Chief Operating Officer of

our Smart Grid Solutions Group; Arthur Vos IV, our Vice President of Marketing and Strategy; and Thomas W. Wren, Jr., our Executive Vice President and General Counsel. We do not maintain key-person insurance on any of these individuals. Any loss or interruption of the services of any of our key employees could significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and implement our strategy. Mr. Wren has informed us that he intends to step down from his role as our General Counsel; however, the effective date of his transition has not been determined.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.
Our ability to compete effectively depends in part upon the maintenance and protection of the intellectual property related to our capacity programs and the hardware, firmware and software that we have acquired or developed internally. Patent protection is unavailable for certain aspects of the technology that is important to our business. In addition, one or more of our pending patent applications may not be issued. To date, we have attempted to rely on copyright, trademark and trade secrecy laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our rights to this technology. However, we have not obtained confidentiality agreements from all of our customers and vendors, some of our licensing or confidentiality agreements are not in writing, and some customers are subject to laws and regulations that require them to disclose information that we would otherwise seek to keep confidential. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive, as is enforcing our rights against unauthorized use. The steps that we have taken or may take may not prevent misappropriation of the technology on which we rely. In addition, effective protection may be unavailable or limited if we expand to other jurisdictions outside the U.S., as the intellectual property laws of foreign countries sometimes offer less protection or have onerous filing requirements. We have previously been engaged in litigation to protect certain of our intellectual property, and further litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. Any litigation could be unsuccessful, cause us to incur substantial costs and divert resources away from our daily business.
We may be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation related to allegations that our products or services infringe on intellectual property held by others, which could result in the loss of use of the product or service.
Third-party patent applications and patents may be applicable to our products. As a result, third-parties may in the future make infringement and other allegations that could subject us to intellectual property litigation relating to our products and services, which litigation could be time-consuming and expensive, divert attention and resources away from our daily business, impede or prevent delivery of our products and services, and require us to pay significant royalties, licensing fees and damages. In addition, parties making infringement and other claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our services and could cause us to pay substantial damages. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available at a reasonable cost, or at all.
Electric utility industry sales cycles can be lengthy and unpredictable and require significant employee time and financial resources with no assurances that we will realize revenues.
Sales cycles with our customers can generally be long and unpredictable. Our customers include electric utilities and large commercial and industrial energy consumers that generally have extended budgeting, procurement and regulatory approval processes. In addition, electric utilities tend to be risk averse and tend to follow industry trends rather than be the first to purchase new products or services, which can extend the lead time for or prevent acceptance of new products or services such as our capacity programs or advanced metering initiatives. Accordingly, our potential customers may take longer to reach a decision to purchase products. This extended sales process requires the dedication of significant time by our personnel and our use of significant financial resources, with no certainty of success or recovery of our related expenses. It is not unusual for an
 
22
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

electric utility or commercial and industrial energy consumer to go through the entire sales process and not accept any proposal or quote. In addition, pilot test programs, which are often conducted and analyzed before a sale becomes final, generally result in operating losses to us due to the lack of scalability, start-up costs, development expenditures and other factors.
If we are unable to expand the distribution of our products through strategic alliances, we may not be able to grow our Smart Grid Solutions or Enerwise Groups.
The ability of our Smart Grid Solutions and Enerwise Groups to grow their businesses depends partly on our success in continuing to increase the number of customers they serve through a variety of strategic marketing alliances with channel partners, metering companies, communications providers, advanced meter reading providers, installation companies and other large multinational companies. Revenues from strategic alliances have not historically accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues, although we plan to increasingly rely on such alliances to grow our business in the future. We may not be able to maintain productive relationships with the companies with which we have strategic alliances, and we may not be able to establish similar relationships with additional companies on a timely and economic basis, if at all.
An increased rate of terminations of residential, commercial and industrial energy consumers, or the use of more efficient products by such consumers, who are enrolled in our VPC or power pool programs, or who would enroll in such program, would negatively impact our business by reducing our revenues and requiring us to spend more money to maintain and grow our participant base.
Our ability to provide electric capacity under our capacity contracts depends on the number of residential, commercial and industrial energy consumers who enroll and participate in our programs. The average annual rate of participant terminations for our VPC programs from inception through September 30, 2007 was approximately 5%. As a result, we will need to acquire new participants on an ongoing basis to maintain available capacity provided to our utility customers. In addition, to the extent existing or future customers install high efficiency air conditioning units which could minimize the effectiveness of our solution as to that consumer, we may face lower measurement and verification results. If we are unable to recruit and retain participants for our capacity programs, we will face difficulties acquiring capacity to sell through such programs or the ISO markets. Furthermore, the increased competition and the length of contracts for commercial and industrial capacity customers may result in an increase of such customers not re-enrolling when their contract ends or terminating their contract for a more lucrative offer, which could further restrict our ability to acquire capacity to sell into such programs. If participant termination rates increase, we will need to acquire more participants in order to maintain our revenues and more participants than estimated to grow our business. This loss of revenues resulting from participant terminations can be significant, and limiting terminations is an important factor in our ability to achieve future profitability. If we are unsuccessful in controlling participant terminations, we may be unable to acquire a sufficient number of new participants or we may incur significant costs to replace participants, which could cause our revenues to decrease, and we might not become profitable.
The success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to develop new products and services and increase the functionality of our current products.
Since 2001, we have invested over $7.8 million in research and development costs associated with our current Smart Grid products. From time to time, our customers have expressed a need for increased functionality in our products. In response, and as part of our strategy to enhance our clean energy solutions and grow our business, we plan to continue to make substantial investments in the research and development of new technologies. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to design and manufacture new competitive products, to enhance our existing products and to provide new value-added services. Product development initiatives will require continued investment, and we may experience unforeseen problems in the performance of our technologies or products, including new technologies that we develop and deploy. Furthermore, we may not achieve market acceptance of our new products and solutions. For example, in the past we incurred significant costs to develop a specific product for large commercial and industrial customers that has
 
23
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

found limited market acceptance. If we are unable to develop new products and services, or if the market does not accept such products and services, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.
If we fail to hire and train additional personnel and improve our controls and procedures to respond to the growth of our business, the quality of our products and services could materially suffer and cause us to lose customers.
Our business and operations have expanded rapidly since our inception. For example, from January 2003 through September 30, 2007, the number of our employees increased more than 289%, growing from 70 to 272. To continue supporting our expanding customer base effectively and to meet our growth objectives for the future, we are currently working to fill multiple positions within our company. In addition, we must continue to successfully train, motivate and retain our existing and future employees. In order to manage our expanding operations, we will also need to continue to improve our management, operational and financial controls and our reporting systems and procedures. All of these measures will require significant expenditures and will demand the attention of management. If we are not able to hire, train and retain the necessary personnel, or if these operational and reporting improvements are not implemented successfully, the quality of our products and services could materially suffer as a result and cause us to lose customers.
We may not be able to maintain quality customer care during periods of growth or in connection with the addition of new and complex products or services, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire and retain utility customers and participants in our capacity programs.
In the past, during periods of growth, we have not been able to expand our customer care operations quickly enough to meet the needs of our increased customer base, and the quality of our customer care has suffered. As we add new and complex products and services, we will face challenges in increasing and training our customer care staff. If we are unable to hire, train and retain sufficient personnel to provide adequate customer care in a timely manner, we may experience customer dissatisfaction and increased participant terminations.
We will require significant additional capital to pursue our growth strategy, but we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.
The growth of our business will depend on substantial amounts of additional capital for marketing and product development of our capacity programs and Smart Grid products. In addition, we will consider strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies to grow our business, which could require significant capital and could increase our capital expenditures related to future operation of the acquired business or technology. We may not be able to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. Because of our losses, we do not fit traditional credit lending criteria, which, in particular, could make it difficult for us to obtain loans or to access the capital markets. Moreover, our senior loan and security agreement and our credit agreement contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which, if not waived, could prevent us from obtaining needed capital. Any future credit facilities would likely contain similar restrictions. A failure to obtain additional financing when needed could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our business.
Our loan and security agreements contain financial and operating restrictions that may limit our access to credit. If we fail to comply with covenants in our loan and security agreements, we may be required to repay our indebtedness thereunder, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.
Provisions in our credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation, our senior loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and our loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth, L.P. impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:
 
 	•	 	
incur more debt;

 
 	•	 	
pay dividends and make distributions;

 
 	•	 	
make certain investments;

 
 	•	 	
redeem or repurchase capital stock;

 
24
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	•	 	
create liens;

 
 	•	 	
enter into transactions with affiliates; and

 
 	•	 	
merge or consolidate.

These agreements also contain other customary covenants, including covenants which require us to meet specified financial ratios and financial tests. We may not be able to comply with these covenants in the future. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default and cause us to be unable to borrow under our credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation or our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. In addition to preventing additional borrowings under these agreements, an event of default, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under these agreements, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. If an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation and may be limited further as a result of this offering.
In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. A corporation generally undergoes an “ownership change” when the ownership of its stock, by value, changes by more than 50 percentage points over any three-year testing period. As a result of prior ownership changes, our NOL carryforwards from pre-change periods are subject to an annual usage limitation. In addition, this offering, together with other transactions involving the sale or other transfer of our stock within the applicable three-year testing period (including our initial public offering) may result in an additional ownership change for purposes of Section 382 or significantly increase the likelihood that we will undergo an additional ownership change in the future (which could occur as a result of transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control). The occurrence of an additional ownership change would limit our ability to utilize our NOLs that are not currently subject to limitation, and could further limit our ability to utilize our remaining NOLs and possibly other tax attributes. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect, and could cause such NOLs and other tax attributes to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flow. There can be no assurance that we will realize any U.S. federal income tax benefit from any of our net operating loss carryforwards. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes as well.
Our business may become subject to modified or new government regulation, which may negatively impact our ability to market our products.
Our products and services are not subject to existing federal and state regulations in the U.S. governing the electric utility industry. However, our products and their installation are sometimes subject to government oversight and regulation under state and local ordinances relating to building codes, public safety regulations pertaining to electrical connections and local and state licensing requirements. In the future, federal, state or local governmental entities or competitors may seek to change existing regulations or impose additional regulations. Any modified or new government regulation applicable to our products or services, whether at the federal, state or local level, may negatively impact the installation, servicing and marketing of our products and increase our costs and the price of our products and services.
Changes in the availability and regulation of radio spectrum may cause us to lose utility customers.
A significant number of our products use radio spectrum, which is subject to regulation in the U.S. by the Federal Communications Commission. Licenses for radio frequencies must be obtained and periodically
 
25
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

renewed. Licenses granted to us or our customers may not be renewed on acceptable terms, if at all. The Federal Communications Commission may adopt changes to the rules for our licensed and unlicensed frequency bands that are incompatible with our business. These changes in frequency allocation may result in the termination of demand response programs by our utility customers or the replacement of our systems with ones owned by our competitors. This would erode our competitive advantage with respect to those utility customers and would force us to compete with other providers for their business.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.
Following the completion of our initial public offering in April 2007, the offering proceeds were invested in short and long-term investments. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. For information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk” below.
Our ability to provide bid bonds, performance bonds or letters of credit is limited and could negatively affect our ability to bid on or enter into significant long-term agreements.
We are occasionally required to provide bid bonds or performance bonds to secure our performance under customer contracts. Our ability to obtain such bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputation and external factors beyond our control, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companies consider those factors in relation to the amount of our tangible net worth and other underwriting standards that may change from time to time. Events that affect surety markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. In addition, some of our customers also require collateral in the form of letters of credit to secure performance or to fund possible damages as the result of an event of default under our contracts with them. Our ability to obtain letters of credit under our credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation and our senior loan agreement is limited to $6.0 million in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2007, we had $2.8 million of letters of credit outstanding. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding or letters of credit and, as a result, to bid or enter into significant long-term agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.
We have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock to date, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to reinvest all future earnings in the development and growth of our business. In addition, our senior loan agreement prohibits us from paying dividends and future loan agreements may also prohibit the payment of dividends. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, business opportunities, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant. To the extent we do not pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in our common stock.
Our management, directors and their affiliates hold a significant percentage of our issued and outstanding common stock.
After this offering, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates will own in the aggregate approximately 23.6% of our issued and outstanding common stock. This concentration of ownership could allow our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, voting in concert with other stockholders, to control the
 
26
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

composition of our board of directors, to amend our bylaws or articles of incorporation or to act on any matter submitted to stockholders by outside persons even if such actions could be deemed detrimental to minority stockholders. In addition, Delaware law limits the protection afforded minority stockholders, and we do not intend to enact provisions that may be beneficial to minority holders such as cumulative voting.
Shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price for our common stock to decline even if our business is doing well.
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital in the future through the sale of our equity securities. Under our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 150,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 20,463,793 shares of common stock will be outstanding following this offering. Of these shares, the shares of common stock sold in this offering will be freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, by persons other than “affiliates,” as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Certain of our stockholders will be able to cause us to register common stock that they own under the Securities Act pursuant to registration rights that are described in “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions—Registration Rights for Certain Holders of Our Common Stock.”
The selling stockholders and our officers, directors and certain other stockholders have entered into lock-up agreements described under the caption “Underwriting,” pursuant to which they have agreed, subject to certain exceptions and extensions, not to sell or transfer, directly or indirectly, any shares of our common stock for a period of 90 days from the date of this prospectus or to exercise registration rights during such period with respect to such shares. However, after the lock-up period expires, or if the lock-up restrictions are waived by the underwriters, such persons will be able to sell their shares and exercise registration rights to cause them to be registered. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future sales and issuances of shares of our common stock, or the perception of such sales or issuances, would have on the market price of our common stock. See “Shares Eligible for Future Sale.”
Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, second amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Provisions in our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our second amended and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our second amended and restated bylaws:
 
 	•	 	
provide for a classified board of directors, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control;

 
 	•	 	
authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;

 
 	•	 	
prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors;

 
 	•	 	
require super-majority voting to effect amendments to certain provisions of our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and to effect amendments to our second amended and restated bylaws concerning the number of directors;

 
 	•	 	
limit who may call special meetings;

 
 	•	 	
prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;

 
27
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	•	 	
establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a stockholders meeting; and

 
 	•	 	
require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office.

In addition, Delaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any “interested stockholder,” meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our common stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.
Risks Related to this Offering
We incur substantial compliance costs as a public company.
As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs in 2007 and beyond, and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also expect these new rules and regulations will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.
Our failure to achieve or maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or prevent or detect material misstatements in our annual or interim consolidated financial statements in the future could materially harm our business and cause our stock price to decline.
As a public company, our internal control over financial reporting is required to comply with the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Accordingly, we are required to document and test our internal controls and procedures to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As noted above under the risk factor titled “If we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected,” our independent registered public accounting firm did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2006 but previously had identified material weaknesses for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the six months ended June 30, 2006. In the future, we may identify material weaknesses and deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in a timely manner. Material weaknesses may exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for purposes of our attestation required by reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with our first reporting obligation being in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2008. If we fail to achieve or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404, we will not be able to conclude that we have and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered accounting firm may not be able to issue an unqualified report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected and investors may lose confidence in our financial information, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. In addition, testing and maintaining internal control in accordance with Section 404 will require increased
 
28

management time and resources. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the success of our business and harm our financial results, and you could lose all or a significant portion of your investment. See “—Risks Related to Our Business—If we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.”
Purchasers of common stock will experience immediate and substantial dilution.
Based on the price of $31.48 per share (the closing price for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on November 30, 2007) for this offering, purchasers of our common stock in this offering will experience an immediate and substantial dilution of $29.00 per share in the net tangible book value per share of common stock from the offering price, and our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of September 30, 2007, after giving effect to our recent acquisitions and this offering, would have been $2.48 per share. In addition, following this offering we will also have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options to purchase our common stock, with the options having exercise prices significantly below the offering price of our common stock. You will incur further dilution if outstanding options or warrants to purchase common stock are exercised. In addition, our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue significant numbers of additional shares, including shares that may be issued under our 2006 plan, which could result in further dilution to purchasers of our common stock in this offering.
The price of our common stock may be volatile and if our stock price declines after this offering, you could lose all or a significant part of your investment.
The offering price for the shares being sold in this offering will be determined by negotiations between us and the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the open market following this offering. Consequently, you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price paid by you in this offering. In recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, financial condition or business fundamentals. The market price of our common stock could similarly be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including:
 
 	•	 	
changes in securities analysts’ recommendations and their estimates of our future financial performance;

 
 	•	 	
our investors’ reaction to our press releases, announcements and our filings with the SEC and to those of our competitors;

 
 	•	 	
changes in market valuations of similar companies;

 
 	•	 	
fluctuations in broader stock market prices and volumes;

 
 	•	 	
investor perception of our industry or our prospects;

 
 	•	 	
additions or departures of key personnel;

  commencement of or involvement in litigation;
 
 	•	 	
changes in governmental regulations affecting our business or that of our customers;

 
 	•	 	
announcements by us or our competitors of strategic alliances, significant contracts, new technologies, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

 
 	•	 	
variations in our quarterly results of operations or cash flows, particularly as a result of our revenue recognition policy, which is discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue Recognition;”

 
 	•	 	
revenues and operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in a particular quarter;

 
29
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	•	 	
changes in our pricing policies or pricing policies of our competitors;

 
 	•	 	
future issuances and sales of our common stock or convertible debt;

 
 	•	 	
demand for and trading volume of our common stock; and

 
 	•	 	
changes in general conditions in the domestic and worldwide economies or financial markets.

The occurrence of any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. As a result, you could lose a significant part or all of your investment in our common stock.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysis publish about us, our business or our market. If one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose viability in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

changes in the available capacity provided by our capacity or ISO programs;

 
 	•	 	
loss of a significant customer;

 
 	•	 	
actions by state or federal regulatory agencies;

 
 	•	 	
our dependence on the electric utility industry;

USE OF PROCEEDS
Based on our last reported stock price of $31.48 on November 30, 2007, we estimate our net proceeds from the sale of 800,000 shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $22.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed public offering price of $31.48 per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $0.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same.
We plan to use these net proceeds to finance the capital requirements of our current and future contracts, to finance research and development, to fund any cash consideration for future acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. We are not currently engaged in any negotiations for acquisitions. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.
PRICE RANGE OF OUR COMMON STOCK
Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “COMV” since April 13, 2007. Prior to this time, there was no public market for our common stock.

For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain and reinvest any earnings in our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends. Whether or not we declare any dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors, considering then-existing conditions, including our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions (including those under our loan agreements), business opportunities and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.

CAPITALIZATION
The following table sets forth our capitalization as of September 30, 2007, on an actual basis and on a pro forma as adjusted basis, after giving effect to:
 
 	•	 	
the issuance of 1,279,545 shares of our common stock and $17.0 million in subordinated convertible notes payable in connection with our acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc., or Enerwise, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments—Acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc.;”

 
 	•	 	
the issuance of 34,129 shares of our common stock and $3.0 million in subordinated convertible notes payable in connection with our acquisition of the entities comprising the business of Public Energy Solutions, or PES, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments—Acquisition of Public Energy Solutions;”

 
 	•	 	
the repayment of PES bank debt of $1,236 on October 1, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the equity purchase agreement related to the PES acquisition;

 
 	•	 	
the sale of 800,000 shares of our common stock in this offering at the price of $31.48 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and the use of the proceeds as described under “Use of Proceeds;” and

 
 	•	 	
the conversion of $1.0 million of convertible debt into 138,121 shares of common stock by a selling stockholder in this offering.

For purposes of the pro forma as adjusted column, we have assumed the net proceeds from this offering will be $22.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed public offering price of $31.48 per share price would increase (decrease) each of the total stockholders’ equity and total capitalization line items by approximately $0.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same.
This table assumes no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option and should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected Historical Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus.

DILUTION
If you invest in our common stock, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the offering price per share of our common stock and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after the completion of this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the per share offering price of the common stock is substantially in excess of the book value per share attributable to the existing stockholders for the presently outstanding common stock.
As of September 30, 2007, our net tangible book value was approximately $27.2 million, or approximately $1.39 per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per share represents the amount of total tangible assets less our total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding.
On a pro forma as adjusted basis, after giving effect to (1) the sale of 800,000 shares of common stock in this offering at an assumed public offering price of $31.48 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and (2) the conversion of $1.0 million of convertible debt into 138,121 shares of common stock by a selling stockholder in this offering, our net tangible book value as of September 30, 2007 would have been approximately $51.1 million, or $2.48 per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of $1.09 per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $29.00 per share to new investors purchasing common stock in this offering.
The following table illustrates this dilution to new investors on a per share basis:

The following table summarizes, as of September 30, 2007, the differences between the number of shares of common stock owned by existing stockholders and to be owned by new public investors, the aggregate cash consideration paid to us and the average price per share paid by our existing stockholders and to be paid by new public investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering at the offering price of $31.48 per share:

The number of shares disclosed for the new investors does not include the shares being purchased by the new investors from the selling stockholders in this offering but reflects the conversion of $1.0 million of convertible debt into 138,121 shares of common stock by a selling stockholder in this offering.
If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the number of shares of common stock held by new investors will increase to approximately 1,085,745 shares, or approximately 5.3% of the total number of

shares of our common stock to be outstanding after this offering, our existing stockholders would own approximately 94.7% of the total number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after this offering, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of common stock would be approximately $2.64 and the dilution in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of common stock to new investors would be $28.84.
The discussion and tables above assume no exercise of the stock options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,678,976 shares of our common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2007, with a weighted average exercise price of $10.94 per share, excluding the 138,121 shares of convertible debt converted as part of this offering. To the extent any of these options or warrants are exercised, there will be further dilution to new investors. The following table summarizes the effect that the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants as of September 30, 2007 would have on the table set forth above:

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed public offering price of $31.48 per share would increase or decrease our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value after giving effect to this offering by $0.4 million, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock after giving effect to this offering by $0.04 per share and the dilution in net tangible book value per share of our common stock to new investors in this offering by $0.04 per share, assuming no change to the number of shares of common stock offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

(1)	 	In calculating diluted net income per share, the income numerator was increased by the interest expense savings and the amortization expense savings resulting from the assumed conversion of our convertible debt. The weighted average shares used in computing the dilutive net income per share have been calculated assuming the conversion of our convertible debt as well as the conversion of all shares of convertible preferred stock, which were converted into shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering on April 18, 2007.
(2)	 	EBITDA is defined as net loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for other GAAP financial measures such as net loss, operating loss or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP. In addition, our calculation of EBITDA may or may not be consistent with that of other companies. We urge you to review the GAAP financial measures included in this prospectus and our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, and the other financial information contained in this prospectus, and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
 
 	 	
EBITDA is a common alternative measure of performance used by investors, financial analysts and rating agencies to assess operating performance for companies in our industry. Depreciation is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue. We do not believe that this expense is indicative of our core operating performance because the depreciable lives of assets vary greatly

depending on the maturity terms of our VPC contracts, which range from three to 13 years. The clean energy sector has experienced recent trends of increased growth and new company development, which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital (which affect interest expense). Management views interest expense as a by-product of capital structure decisions and, therefore, it is not indicative of our core operating performance. Our internal budgets are based on EBITDA, and we use EBITDA as one of several criteria to determine performance-based cash compensation.

 	 	Use of non-GAAP financial measures is subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment of which charges should properly be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure. Management accounts for these limitations by not relying exclusively on non-GAAP financial measures, but only using such information to supplement GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from such measures used by other companies.
 
(3)	 	Contracted capacity represent the maximum amount of megawatts of electric capacity that can be provided under the capacity contracts.
(4)	 	The terms installed capacity and built-out megawatts generally refer to the number of devices installed multiplied by the historically highest demonstrated capacity provided per device for the applicable service area.
(5)	 	Available capacity represents the amount of electric capacity that we have made available to our customers during each contract year based on the results of our measurement and verification process. We report available capacity in the fourth quarter of each year.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements have been prepared to give effect to our acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc., or Enerwise, and Public Energy Solutions, LLC, Public Electric, Inc. and PES NY, LLC, or collectively PES, using the purchase method of accounting with the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements. These pro forma statements were prepared as if the acquisitions described above had been completed as of January 1, 2006 for the statements of operations purposes. Comverge, Enerwise and PES all operate on a calendar basis.
On July 23, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding Enerwise stock in exchange for $23.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $17.0 million in subordinated convertible promissory notes payable to Enerwise stockholders and 1,279,545 shares of our common stock, valued at $36.9 million.
On September 29, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding equity interests in PES in exchange for $9.3 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $3.0 million in subordinated convertible promissory notes payable to PES equityholders and 34,129 shares of our common stock, valued at $1.1 million.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements presented are based on the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have actually been reported had the acquisitions described above occurred on January 1, 2006 for statement of operations purposes, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future financial position or results of operations of the combined company. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements include adjustments, which are based on preliminary estimates, to reflect the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Enerwise and PES. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the completion of the acquisitions and will be based upon actual net tangible and intangible assets acquired as well as liabilities assumed. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of Enerwise or PES will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Final purchase accounting adjustments for Enerwise or PES may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented here.
The pro forma as-adjusted totals give effect to the sale of 800,000 shares of our common stock in this offering at an assumed offering price of $31.48 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on November 30, 2007, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We plan to use these net proceeds to finance the capital requirements of our current and future long-term contracts, to finance research and development, to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid for future acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.
These unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are based upon the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Comverge, Enerwise and PES, and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Comverge, Enerwise and PES and related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of Comverge included in this prospectus.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations reflect the combined results of operations of Comverge, Enerwise and PES for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the nine months ended September 30, 2007, in both cases as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2006.
You should not rely on the selected unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have occurred had Comverge, Enerwise and PES been combined during these time periods or the future results that may be achieved after the acquisitions.
There were no transactions between Comverge and Enerwise, Comverge and PES, nor Enerwise and PES during the periods presented. There are no significant differences between the accounting policies of Comverge, Enerwise and PES.
Note 2: Preliminary Purchase Price
On July 23, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Enerwise for $77.0 million in consideration, comprised of $23.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $17.0 million in subordinated convertible promissory notes payable to Enerwise stockholders and 1,279,545 shares of our common stock, valued at $36.9 million. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 99-12, Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination, the fair value of our common stock to be issued was determined using an average price of $28.82, which was the average closing price of our common stock for a few days before and after the terms of the merger agreement were agreed to and announced.
On September 29, 2007, we completed the acquisition of PES for $13.4 million in consideration, comprised of $9.3 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $3.0 million in subordinated convertible promissory notes payable to PES equityholders and 34,129 shares of our common stock, valued at $1.1 million. In accordance with EITF No. 99-12, the fair value of our common stock to be issued was determined using a price of $32.86.
The estimated direct transaction cost consists primarily of legal and accounting fees and other external costs related directly to the acquisitions. The preliminary purchase price for Enerwise and PES as of September 30, 2007 is summarized as follows:

Note 3: Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
For pro forma purposes, the total estimated purchase price will be allocated to Enerwise's and PES’ net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of September 30, 2007. We will amortize certain intangible assets over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the projected utility of such assets based upon the information available. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired has been classified as goodwill. The preliminary allocations of the estimated purchase prices as of September 30, 2007 is as follows:

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information reflects a preliminary allocation of the purchase price. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not yet complete and are subject to future adjustments. The final purchase price allocation will be based on Enerwise’s closing balance sheet as of July 23, 2007 and PES’ closing balance sheet as of September 29, 2007. The significant items which could change are tangible and intangible assets, goodwill, and commitments and contingencies. The valuations of these significant items are currently underway and we expect the valuations to be complete by the filing of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Note 4: Pro Forma and Supplemental Net Loss Per Share
The pro forma basic and diluted loss per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during each period and the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with the 2007 acquisitions of Enerwise and PES.
Also, 191,183 shares and 204,777 shares are held in escrow as contingent consideration related to the future operating performance of Enerwise and PES, respectively. The escrow shares are considered contingently issued until the performance metrics are met and are not included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are released from escrow. As contingent shares, they are excluded from our diluted net loss per share calculation for both periods since their effect would be anti-dilutive.

The supplemental net loss per share is not required by Article 11 of Regulation S-X. However, we believe the information is meaningful to the reader in understanding the impact of recent equity transactions on the net loss per share calculation. The effect of the shares from the initial public offering and this offering are anti-dilutive and reduces our supplemental basic and diluted net loss per share in the periods presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. The cautionary statements made in this prospectus should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this prospectus. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus. You should read “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are a clean energy company providing peaking and base load capacity to electric utilities, grid operators and associated electricity markets. We provide electric capacity to our customers either through long-term contracts where we actively manage demand or by selling our demand response systems to utilities that operate them. We provide our clean energy solutions through our three operating segments: the Smart Grid Solutions Group, the Alternative Energy Resources Group and the Enerwise Group. Our Smart Grid Solutions Group develops and delivers state-of-the-art demand response, smart metering, advanced metering initiative, advanced meter reading and other monitoring and control hardware and software, which allow our utility customers to measure, manage, shift and reduce energy consumption in real-time. Our Alternative Energy Resources Group primarily offers our Virtual Peaking Capacity, or VPC, programs, through which we provide electric capacity to our utility customers during periods of peak energy demand by remotely operating high energy-consuming devices, such as central air conditioners, water heaters and pool pumps. We provide this capacity by developing, owning and operating energy load management systems through long-term, pay-for-performance contracts. Pay-for-performance means that we enter into long-term contracts with utilities and are paid under each contract based on the amount of verifiable kilowatt hours of capacity that we provide. In July 2007, we formed our third operating segment, the Enerwise Group, through the acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc. Our Enerwise Group provides energy management and demand response solutions to large commercial and industrial consumers. These programs allow our customers to participate in regional demand response capacity programs offered by various Independent System Operators, energy efficiency upgrades and energy management solutions. In September 2007, we acquired Public Energy Solutions, LLC and its related entities, or PES, which became a part of our Alternative Energy Resources Group. Unlike our VPC programs which provide peak capacity, PES provides long-term base load capacity programs.
We first introduced our VPC programs in 2003. Growth and acceptance of our VPC programs have expanded the growth of our business as a whole. Our total revenues grew from $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. While our revenues have grown, we have incurred net losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of $66.4 million as of September 30, 2007. Initially, our net losses were driven principally by start-up costs and the costs of developing our technology. However, in 2002 we made the strategic decision to develop, own and operate load management systems on an outsourced basis for the benefit of our utility customers through our VPC programs. We have since made significant investments in our VPC programs, both in the form of capital expenditures to build out the capacity under our VPC contracts and participant acquisition costs such as advertising and participant incentive payments. Our net losses since 2002 have been driven principally by general and administrative, marketing, operating and depreciation expenses related to capital expenditures for equipment required to support our VPC programs. As a result of investments in our VPC programs, revenues from our Alternative Energy Resources Group have represented an increasing percentage of our total revenues, growing from 7% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 52% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006.
We expect this growth to continue with our VPC programs as well as with our base load capacity programs added as a result of our recent acquisition of PES, and with the commercial and industrial solutions we offer

through our Enerwise Group. We plan to continue the expansion and development of our VPC programs to grow our revenues and customer base, which will include increased marketing and operating expenses. In the nine months ended September 30, 2007, we entered into three new VPC contracts and amended an existing VPC contract that increased the capacity under contract by 272 megawatts in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2007, our existing VPC contracts represented contracted capacity of 492 megawatts. We have built out 227 megawatts of capacity as of September 30, 2007 compared to 158 megawatts as of September 30, 2006. We expect to incur approximately $35.1 million in capital expenditures over the next three years to build out the remaining megawatts under existing VPC programs as of September 30, 2007, of which we expect to incur approximately $8.7 million through December 31, 2007. In October 2007 we entered into new VPC contracts with The Connecticut Light and Power Company and Southern California Edison. If these VPC contracts receive regulatory approval, we will invest additional amounts to build out these and other new programs as we are awarded additional VPC contracts in the future. In the short-term, our success operating such contracts would have a negative effect on earnings because of the consumer acquisition costs that we incur during the installation phase of the contract. These increased costs may cause us to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2007, our base load capacity contracts represented contracted capacity of 47 megawatts and our Enerwise Group provided for sale 486 megawatts of capacity in open market capacity programs.
As a result of the completion of our initial public offering on April 18, 2007, our general and administrative expenses are substantially greater as a result of becoming a public company. We currently estimate that our total annualized general and administrative expenses will increase by approximately $1.5 million as a result of our initial public offering.
The aggregate proceeds of our initial public offering were $86.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us. Following the offering, $1.0 million of the proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt under the senior loan agreement. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Indebtedness—Senior Loan Agreement.”
Recent Developments
Long-Term Contracts
In May 2007, we executed a new VPC contract with Nevada Power Company to provide up to 123 megawatts of contracted capacity. Included in the VPC contract is the operation and maintenance of Nevada Power Company’s existing demand response system which is estimated to provide 21 megawatts of capacity. We refer to our operation of existing demand response systems as brownfield opportunities to grow our business.
In May 2007, the California Public Utilities Commission approved our previously announced Demand Response Purchase Agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Under the agreement, our VPC program will provide Pacific Gas and Electric Company with up to 50 megawatts of electricity capacity in the first two years and up to 57 megawatts thereafter.
In June 2007, the California Public Utilities Commission approved our previously announced expansion of our Demand Response Capacity Delivery Agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric for an additional 30 megawatts of capacity. Under this VPC program, San Diego Gas & Electric will be provided with up to 100 megawatts of capacity.
In August 2007, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approved our previously announced Demand Response Purchase Agreement with Public Service Company of New Mexico. Under the agreement, our VPC program will provide Public Service Company of New Mexico with up to 20, 31 and 45 megawatts of contracted capacity during the first, second and third years of the program, respectively, and up to 62 megawatts of capacity thereafter.
In October 2007, we executed a new VPC contract with Southern California Edison to provide up to 50 megawatts of contracted capacity. The program is subject to approval by the California Public Utilities Commission.

In October 2007, we executed a new hardware, software and services agreement through our Smart Grid Solutions Group with Tampa Electric Company to expand the Energy Planner program utilizing our Maingate Home system to provide an estimated 12 megawatts of demand response capacity over three years.
In October 2007, we entered into a new VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to provide up to 130 megawatts of capacity over a term of 10 years. The contract is subject to approval by the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control. Previously, we operated two VPC contracts with ISO New England Inc. that provided 60 megawatts of capacity, in the aggregate, which expired as of October 1, 2007, per their original contractual term. As we own the operating assets at the end of the contractual term, we have the ability to deploy those assets on behalf of a new utility and to receive payments for providing capacity in 2008 and beyond. Accordingly, in October 2007, we entered into a new VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to provide up to 130 megawatts of capacity over a 10-year contract through 2017. We expect a portion of the 60 megawatts of capacity idled upon the expiration of the ISO New England Inc. contracts will be redeployed to fulfill the contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company, if the contract receives regulatory approval. The other alternative is to deploy these idled assets in an independent system operator auction. In November 2007, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control denied approval of our VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company as submitted. We are working with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to amend the term of the agreement to allow the parties to amend and resubmit the contract, which remains in effect, in accordance with the parameters suggested by the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control.
Acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc.
On July 23, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Enerwise. Enerwise merged with and into Comverge Eagle, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of June 27, 2007. Enerwise is an energy infrastructure management, demand response and renewable energy services and technology provider that enables commercial and industrial customers to reduce energy consumption and total costs, improve energy infrastructure reliability and make informed decisions regarding energy and renewable energy purchases and programs. Enerwise became a new operating segment of Comverge after the acquisition.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement with Enerwise, the Enerwise stockholders received the total consideration of approximately $79.1 million, which excludes the value of the 191,183 shares of our common shares issued into escrow as follows:
 
 	•	 	
$25.2 million in cash;

 
 	•	 	
1,279,545 shares of our common stock, valued at $36.9 million; and

 
 	•	 	
subordinated convertible promissory notes in the original aggregate principal amount of $17.0 million that are convertible into an aggregate of up to 508,373 shares of our common stock.

Pursuant to the terms of the Enerwise escrow agreement, the Enerwise shares of common stock issued into escrow will be earned by the Enerwise stockholders and released only upon the achievement by the business unit that represents the acquired business of Enerwise of at least $36.0 million in revenue and at least $11.0 million of gross profit for 2008. If both of the foregoing metrics are not met, all of the Enerwise shares of common stock issued into escrow may at our sole discretion be released to us and will be held in our treasury. The Enerwise shares of common stock issued into escrow are also available to us to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Enerwise as set forth in the merger agreement. Pursuant to the merger agreement with Enerwise, we are entitled to be reimbursed from the Enerwise shares of common stock issued into escrow for indemnifiable damages in excess of $0.3 million in the aggregate. Although we do not currently anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock, any dividends that are paid on the Enerwise shares of common stock issued into escrow will be placed in escrow and will also be available to us for indemnification purposes. If the Enerwise shares of common stock issued into escrow are earned pursuant to the performance metrics, any dividends earned during the escrow period and not used to satisfy indemnification obligations will be released to the former Enerwise stockholders.

Acquisition of Public Energy Solutions
On September 29, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Public Energy Solutions, LLC, and its related entities, or PES. Comverge Giants, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of PES pursuant to an equity purchase agreement dated as of September 29, 2007. PES is an energy efficiency company that implements permanent base load reduction solutions for commercial and industrial customers under long-term, pay-for-performance contracts with a utility. PES became part of our Alternative Energy Resources operating segment after the acquisition.
Pursuant to the terms of the equity purchase agreement, the PES equityholders received total consideration of approximately $13.4 million, which excludes the value of 204,777 shares of our common shares issued into escrow as follows:
 
 	•	 	
$9.3 million in cash;

 
 	•	 	
34,129 shares of our common stock, valued at $1.1 million; and

 
 	•	 	
subordinated convertible promissory notes in the original aggregate principal amount of $3.0 million that are convertible into an aggregate of up to 74,386 shares of our common stock.

Pursuant to the terms of the PES escrow agreement, the PES shares of common stock issued into escrow will be earned by the PES equityholders and released as follows:
 
 	•	 	
If revenue of at least $9.1 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of at least $2.0 million are attained by the business unit that represents the acquired businesses of PES for the full fiscal year of 2007, then $0.9 million in cash will be paid and 11,945 shares of our common stock will be released from escrow.

 
 	•	 	
If revenue of at least $13.2 million and EBITDA of at least $3.5 million are attained in fiscal 2008, then $0.2 million in cash will be paid and 124,573 shares of our common stock will be released from escrow.

 
 	•	 	
If revenue of at least $15.0 million and EBITDA of at least $4.5 million are attained in fiscal 2008, then an additional $2.0 million in cash will be paid and 68,259 shares of our common stock will be released from escrow.

We have also agreed to issue an additional 17,064 shares of our restricted common stock to the employees of PES upon achievement of the 2007 metrics and 17,064 shares of our restricted common stock upon achievement of the 2008 metrics. If any of the foregoing metrics are not met, the applicable PES shares of common stock issued into escrow may at our sole discretion, be released to us and will be held in our treasury. The PES shares of common stock issued into escrow are also available to the Company to satisfy certain indemnification obligations as set forth in the equity purchase agreement.
Pursuant to the equity purchase agreement, we are entitled to be reimbursed from the PES shares of common stock issued into escrow for indemnification damages we incur in excess of $0.1 million in the aggregate. Upon the final determination of the amount of an indemnified claim, we are entitled to reduce the number of shares of our common stock in escrow and available for payment upon the achievement of certain performance metrics to satisfy such claim at an agreed value of $29.30 per share. Although we do not currently anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock, any dividends that are paid on the PES shares of common stock issued into escrow will be placed in escrow and will also be available to us for indemnification purposes. If the PES shares of common stock issued into escrow are earned pursuant to the performance metrics, any dividends earned during the escrow period and not used to satisfy indemnification obligations will be released to the former PES equityholders.
Operating Segments
We operate through three operating segments: the Smart Grid Solutions Group, the Alternative Energy Resources Group and the Enerwise Group. The Smart Grid Solutions Group sells hardware, software and

installation services to utilities that elect to own and operate such demand response networks for their own benefit. The Alternative Energy Resources Group sells electric capacity to utilities on an outsourced basis under long-term contracts. The Alternative Energy Resources Group accomplishes this by developing, owning, and managing a demand response network on behalf of the utility. The Alternative Energy Resources group also provides utilities program management and marketing services on an outsourced basis. The Enerwise Group provides energy infrastructure management, demand response and renewable energy services and technologies that enable commercial and industrial customers to reduce energy consumption and total costs, improve energy infrastructure reliability and make informed decisions on energy and renewable energy purchases and programs. Only operations of the historical Enerwise entity are included in the Enerwise Group segment.
Smart Grid Solutions Group
Our Smart Grid Solutions Group offers a broad range of products from basic one-way load control switches to smart thermostats to comprehensive two-way data collection and control systems. The most widely-deployed products offered by our Smart Grid Solutions Group are our digital control unit, an intelligent, microprocessor-driven solution for load management control, which is installed on large energy-consuming devices and controls the cycling and operation of the device, and our SuperStat, an advanced, programmable thermostat solution with embedded communications to control the air conditioning and heating load.
Our Alternative Energy Resources Group segment purchases hardware and software developed and delivered by our Smart Grid Solutions Group and for use in our VPC programs. As a result, the Alternative Energy Resources Group segment has become the largest purchaser of the Smart Grid Solutions Group’s products.
Alternative Energy Resources Group
Our Alternative Energy Resources Group primarily offers VPC programs to electric utilities pursuant to which we provide capacity, on a pay-for-performance basis, through long-term contracts. Under our VPC programs, we develop, operate and manage the entire load management system. The Alternative Energy Resources Group provides multi-year energy outsourced solutions, which generate recurring revenues. As of September 30, 2007, we had seven VPC contracts, one with each of PacifiCorp, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Public Service Company of New Mexico, San Diego Gas & Electric Company and Nevada Power Company and two with ISO New England Inc. The two VPC contracts we had with ISO New England Inc. terminated pursuant to their terms as of October, 2007. In October 2007, we entered into two new VPC contracts, one with The Connecticut Light and Power Company and one with Southern California Edison. Our Alternative Energy Resources Group also provides utilities program management services in which we design, build-out and operate a load control program, with the utility retaining ownership of the underlying asset. In addition, the Alternative Energy Resources Group also provides utilities marketing services on an outsourced basis. In September 2007, we acquired PES, which became a part of our Alternative Energy Resources Group. PES provides long-term base load capacity programs to utilities.
Once we secure a VPC contract with a utility customer, our Alternative Energy Resources Group incurs significant marketing costs to identify and enroll participants in our VPC programs. These participant acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the participant is paid an annual or one-time incentive to enroll and participate in the VPC program. The incentive payments are recognized as a cost of revenue over the annual commitment period. Once a participant enrolls in one of our VPC programs, we install a digital control unit or thermostat at the participant’s location. The cost of the installation and the hardware are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining term of the contract with the utility, which is shorter than the operating life of the equipment. Until our build-out of a VPC program reaches a critical mass, the participant acquisition costs typically result in lower operating margins and greater losses in the early years of a VPC contract.
Enerwise Group
Our Enerwise Group offers energy-related services comprising two principal offerings: energy management and energy and capacity services. The energy management services include the assessment of market

opportunities in deregulated and unregulated markets and the performance of energy auditing and implementation strategies. These demand response services provide commercial and industrial customers with an ability to participate in demand response programs offered in their area by grid operators such as PJM Interconnection. The energy and capacity services include the upgrade and maintenance of power systems such as the implementation of power system distribution analysis, testing, maintenance, replacement or repair, engineering design and consulting, meter and sub-meter operations, and data management and analysis.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenues when the following criteria have been met: delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, collection is probable, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.
In accordance with SAB 104, the Company defers revenue and associated cost of revenue in its Alternative Energy Resources Group segment related to certain long-term VPC contracts until such time as the annual contract price is fixed and determinable. Revenue is invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis throughout the contract year. The VPC contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers, and require a measurement and verification of such capacity on an annual basis in order to determine final contract consideration for a given contract year. Contract years begin at the end of a control season (generally, at the end of a utility’s summer cooling season that correlates to the end of the utility’s peak demand for electricity) and continue for twelve months thereafter.
The Company, through the acquisition of PES, enters into agreements to provide base load capacity services to utilities or commercial and industrial end customers. Base load capacity revenues are earned based on the Company’s ability to achieve committed capacity through load reduction. In order to provide capacity, the Company delivers and installs demand side management measures to a portfolio of commercial and industrial end customers. The base load capacity contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers, and include a measurement and verification of such capacity in order to determine contract consideration. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company defers revenue and associated cost of revenue in its electric load reduction services until such time as the capacity amount and therefore the related revenue is fixed and determinable. Once the capacity amount has been verified, the revenue is recognized. If the revenue is subject to penalty, refund or an ongoing obligation, the revenue is deferred until the liability is resolved and/or the Company has met its performance obligation.
The Enerwise Group segment enters into agreements to provide demand response and capacity event services. The demand response contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility end customers when the utility calls a demand response event to curtain electrical usage. Demand response revenues are earned based on the Company’s ability to deliver capacity. In order to provide capacity, the Company manages a portfolio of commercial and industrial end users’ electric loads. Capacity amounts are verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a customer initiated demand response test. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company recognizes revenue and associated cost of revenue in its demand response services at such time as the capacity amount and therefore the related revenue is fixed and determinable.
Capacity event services revenue is contingent revenue earned based upon actual amount of energy provided during the capacity event. Contingent revenue from capacity events are recognized when the capacity amount is fixed and determinable.
The Smart Grid Solutions Group sells hardware products directly to utilities for use and deployment by the utility. In addition, it provides installation services under a long-term service contract with one of our customers. The Company recognizes revenue for such sales when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and all other criteria of SAB 104 have been met.
As of September 30, 2007, we had deferred revenues and deferred costs of $17.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively, related to our VPC contracts that have not completed a measurement and verification test. As of

December 31, 2006, such deferred revenues and deferred costs were $4.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The deferred revenues and deferred costs related to our VPC contracts as of September 30, 2006 were $16.5 million and $6.6 million, respectively.
Separate from our VPC program, utilities can contract with us for load control program design, build-out and operation services, while retaining ownership of the underlying assets. Our load control programs are targeted for utilities not only needing to purchase capacity but also wanting to own the underlying load management system. The programs have contracts with multiple element arrangements and provide for several deliverables to the customer. Because we do not have objective evidence of the fair value of each element, the elements do not qualify for separate accounting and therefore, revenue for all elements is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. As of September 30, 2007, we had deferred revenues and deferred costs related to these program management arrangements of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, such deferred revenues and deferred costs were $1.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
Payments from Long-Term Contracts
Payments from long-term contracts represent our estimate of total payments that we expect to receive under long-term agreements with thirteen of our utility customers in our Smart Grid Solutions Group and our Alternative Energy Resources Group. The information presented below with respect to payments from long-term contracts includes payments related to our VPC contracts, base load contracts of PES and newly awarded VPC contracts as of the dates indicated. We have not included payments our Enerwise Group will receive from selling capacity in power pool programs because such contracts are not long-term contractual arrangements. As of November 30, 2007, we estimated that our total payments to be received through 2017 were approximately $289 million. Of this amount, we expect payments of $242 million from our Alternative Energy Resources Group’s contracts, which includes approximately $3 million from a marketing contract, and $47 million from our Smart Grid Solutions Group’s contracts. These estimated payments do not include any estimated payments from our VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company, which was denied regulatory approval as initially submitted. While we are working with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to amend and resubmit the contract to the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control for approval, we have excluded any estimated payments from this contract in light of the initial denial.
These estimates of payments from long-term contracts are forward-looking statements based on the contractual terms and conditions. In management’s view, such information was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and, to management’s knowledge and belief, presents the assumptions and considerations on which we base our belief that we can receive such payments. However, this information should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results, and readers of this prospectus should not place undue reliance on this information. Any differences among these assumptions, other factors and our actual experiences may result in actual payments in future periods significantly differing from management’s current estimates of payments allowed under the long-term contracts and our actual experiences may result in actual payments collected being significantly lower than current estimates. See “Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business—We may not receive the payments anticipated by our long-term contracts and recognize revenue from our backlog, and comparisons of period-to-period estimates are not necessarily meaningful, may not be indicative of actual payments and should not be relied upon” in our Registration Statement on Form S-1, Amendment No. 9, (File No. 333-137813) filed with the SEC on April 12, 2007. The information in this section is designed to summarize the financial terms of our long-term contracts and is not intended to provide guidance on our future operating results, including revenue or profitability.
Our estimated payments from long-term contracts have been prepared by management based on the following assumptions:
VPC Contracts:
 
 	•	 	
Our existing VPC contracts as of November 30, 2007, represented contracted capacity of 482 megawatts, an increase of 262 megawatts compared to contracted capacity of 220 megawatts as of

Index to Financial Statements

 	
December 31, 2006. As of September 30, 2007, we had built out 227 megawatts of capacity, compared to 175 megawatts of capacity as of December 31, 2006. In calculating the estimated $198 million of payments from our VPC contracts as of November 30, 2007, we have assumed that we will complete the build out of our remaining 309 megawatts by the end of 2010, reaching the full 482 megawatts of potential available capacity under our load management systems. Our expectations regarding the build-out under our VPC contracts are based on our experience to date in building out the load management systems.
 
 	•	 	
As of September 30, 2007, we had VPC contracts with 492 megawatts of contracted capacity, of which we had built out 227 megawatts of this capacity. In calculating the estimated $172 million of payments from these VPC contracts as of September 30, 2007, we have assumed that we will complete the build out of our remaining 265 megawatts by the end of 2010.

 
 	•	 	
On October 1, 2007, the two VPC contracts with ISO New England Inc. terminated pursuant to their terms, which represented 71 megawatts of installed capacity.

 
 	•	 	
Our VPC contract entered into during October 2007 with Southern California Edison represents contracted capacity of 50 megawatts. In calculating the estimated $25.5 million of payments from this VPC contract, we have assumed that we will receive the required regulatory approvals of the program from the California Public Utilities Commission and complete the build out of the entire 50 megawatts by the end of 2010.

 
 	•	 	
We have assumed that once our build-out phase is complete we will operate our VPC contracts at their maximum contractual capacity for the remainder of the term. For example, if one of our VPC contracts provides for 90 megawatts of contracted capacity, we have assumed that upon full build-out we will provide our utility customer with 90 megawatts of available capacity for the remainder of the contract term.

 
 	•	 	
The amount our utility customers pay to us at the end of each contract year may vary based upon the results of measurement and verification tests performed each contract year based on the electric capacity that we made available to the utility during the contract year. See “—Revenue Recognition” for further explanation of the measurement and verification procedures and our associated revenue recognition policies. For purposes of calculating our payments from long-term contracts, we have assumed that the capacity we will provide our utility customer is the maximum contractual capacity under the applicable contract and that payments resulting from the measurement and verification tests will remain constant based on our current measurement and verification performance. We have and will continue to utilize our experience through measurement and verification testing and our VPC programs to more accurately derive our estimated capacity, which in turn will allow for more detailed marketing and more competitive pricing for our VPC pay-for-performance programs.

 
 	•	 	
The amount of available capacity we are able to provide, and therefore the amount of payments we receive, is dependent upon the number of participants in our VPC programs. For purposes of estimating our payments under long-term contracts, we have assumed the rate of replacement of participant terminations under our VPC contracts will remain consistent with our historical average.

 
 	•	 	
Payments from long-term contracts include $11.4 million that we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months, which we include in backlog. Payments from long-term contracts exclude $13.2 million of payments which have already been received but have been deferred that we expect to recognize as revenue over the course of the next 12 months, which are included in backlog.

Base Load Capacity Contracts:
 
 	•	 	
Our existing energy efficiency contracts as of November 30, 2007, were acquired as part of our PES acquisition and represent potential base load contracted capacity of 47 megawatts. In calculating the estimated $40.7 million in payments from these contracts, we have assumed we will complete the build-out of the entire 47 megawatts by the end of 2010. We have assumed that once our build-out is

 
55

complete, the permanent base load reduction will remain installed providing the maximum contractual capacity for the remainder of the contract term. Our expectations regarding the build-out under our energy efficiency contracts is based on the experience to date PES has in building out base load reduction systems since 2005.
Smart Grid Solutions Group Contracts:
 
 	•	 	
$35.6 million in payments expected to be received over the next eight years under a contract with Gulf Power Company to provide products and services. This is based on estimated contractual minimum order volumes and current payments attributable to installation and other services applied over the term of the contract.

 
 	•	 	
An estimated $11.8 million in purchase orders pursuant to multi-year contracts that we expect will be renewed through 2011 based on amounts and timing of historical purchases.

In addition to the foregoing assumptions, our estimated payments from long-term contracts assume that we will be able to meet on a timely basis all of our obligations under these contracts and that our customers will not terminate the contracts for convenience or other reasons. Our annual net loss in 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $9.3 million, $8.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively. We may continue to generate annual net losses in the future, including through the term of our long-term contracts. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We have incurred annual net losses since our inception, and we may continue to incur annual net losses in the future.”
Although we currently intend to release quarterly updates of future revisions that we may make to our estimated payments from long-term contracts, we do not undertake any obligation to release the results of any future revisions that we may make to these estimated payments from long-term contracts to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this prospectus.
Backlog
Our backlog represents our estimate of revenues from firm commitments, including purchase orders and long-term contracts, that we expect to recognize over the course of the next 12 months. A comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenues. As of September 30, 2006, we had contractual backlog of $29.0 million. As of September 30, 2007, we had backlog of $46.2 million through September 30, 2008, with approximately 63%, or $29.3 million, expected to be fulfilled by December 31, 2007.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, we had revenues of $20.4 million compared to $12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, an increase of $7.6 million, or 60%. Revenues for the nine month periods exclude VPC contract revenues because such revenues are deferred until they are made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test, generally in our fourth fiscal quarter. Deferred revenue increased by 225% from December 31, 2006 to September 30, 2007.
Smart Grid Solutions Group Revenues
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, our Smart Grid Solutions Group had revenues of $13.6 million and $12.2 million, respectively, an increase of $1.4 million or 11%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in digital control unit and SuperStat revenues and a $0.5 million increase in other product sales partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in Maingate product sales and a $0.2 million decrease in service revenue related to a non-recurring service project completed in 2006. Digital control unit and SuperStat shipments to third-party customers were approximately 96,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to 81,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, an increase of 19%. Our Smart Grid Solutions Group also produced approximately 29,000 digital control units for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 for our Alternative Energy Resources Group compared to 27,000 digital control units for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, a 7% increase. Shipments of units to the Alternative Energy Resources Group do not impact reported revenues because such amounts are eliminated in consolidation.

Alternative Energy Resources Group Revenues
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2007, our Alternative Energy Resources Group had revenues of $0.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, an increase of $1.8 million or 334%. The increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 is due to a $1.0 million increase in program management services, and a $0.8 million increase from marketing services commencing in 2007 under the newly awarded contract previously mentioned.
Enerwise Group Revenues
We completed the acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc. on July 23, 2007. The operating results of Enerwise are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company beginning on the date of acquisition. During the period from the date of acquisition to September 30, 2007, Enerwise Group revenue was $4.4 million consisting of $3.2 million of demand response services and $1.4 million of energy and capacity services.
Deferred Revenue and Deferred Cost of Revenue
We defer revenues and direct costs under our VPC contracts until such revenue can be made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test, generally in our fourth quarter. Although our VPC programs were expanded, no residential VPC contract revenues were recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2007. Accordingly, deferred revenue increased from $6.1 million as of December 31, 2006 to $19.8 million as of September 30, 2007, and deferred costs of revenue increased from $2.2 million as of December 31, 2006 to $8.8 million as of September 30, 2007.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, total gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 36% from 41% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2006 due to the addition of lower margin Enerwise Group revenues and the decline in Alternative Energy Resources Group gross margins from 67% in 2006 to 35% in 2007.
Gross profit for the Smart Grid Solutions Group was $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, an increase of $0.7 million or 14%. An 11% revenue increase caused a corresponding increase in gross profit of $0.6 million. A shift in product mix toward higher margin product revenue caused an increase in gross profit of an additional $0.1 million.

Gross profit for the Alternative Energy Resources Group was $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, an increase of $0.4 million, or 125%. The Alternative Energy Resource Group gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was 35% compared to 67% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, also the result of the lower gross margins associated with the new marketing services contract that began in 2007.

General and Administrative Expenses
 
General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $14.5 million compared to $10.5 million for the same period in 2006. The increase of $4.0 million was comprised of a $1.0 million increase arising from the acquisition of Enerwise, a $1.7 million increase in salaries and benefits excluding increases associated with the Enerwise acquisition, a $1.0 million increase in noncash stock compensation expenses, a $0.5 million increase in VPC related customer acquisition costs and a $0.4 million increase in professional fees offset by a $0.6 million decrease in other expenses.
Marketing and Selling Expenses
Marketing and selling expenses were $6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, an increase of $0.7 million, or 11%. The increase was attributable to $0.2 million in additional expenses as a result of the acquisition of the Enerwise Group, increases in salaries and benefits of $0.8 million, an increase in noncash stock compensation expense of $0.1 million, a $0.3 million increase in marketing and advertising expense, a $0.2 million increase in communications expense and a $0.3 million increase in third-party consulting fees offset by a $1.3 million decrease in VPC related customer acquisition costs. Although VPC contract revenue was deferred during the nine month period ended September 30, 2007, we expense customer acquisition costs as incurred. Our marketing costs are expected to increase as we add participants to our VPC programs awarded in 2007.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses are incurred primarily in connection with the identification, testing and development of new Smart Grid products. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2007, research and development expenses were $0.8 million compared with $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 an increase of 29%. The increase was a result of additional expenditures for the development of products to support utility Advanced Metering Infrastructure, or AMI, projects. We expect to increase our spending on AMI product development in the future as utilities begin migrating their meter networks to AMI.

Amortization of Intangible Assets
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2007, amortization of intangible assets increased from $20,000 to $0.3 million. The increase in amortization of intangible assets through September 30, 2007 was due to the acquisitions of Enerwise and PES during the quarter ended September 30, 2007.
Interest (Income) Expense, Net
Interest (income)/expense, net increased from an expense of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 to income of $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, due to $1.8 million in interest earned on proceeds of our initial public offering, partially offset by interest expense of $0.9 million related to debt.
Income Taxes
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, we recorded a tax provision of $21,000 related to a deferred tax liability. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, we recorded an income tax provision of $33,000 related to a deferred tax liability.

A $1.7 million increase in hardware sales by our Smart Grid Solutions Group and an $8.8 million increase in revenue from our Alternative Energy Resources Group accounted for the increase in revenue.
Smart Grid Solutions Group Revenue
Our Smart Grid Solutions Group had revenue of $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.7 million, or 12%. The increase in revenue was due to a $0.4 million increase in service revenue, a $0.3 million increase in our Maingate product sales, a $0.3 million increase in digital control unit and SuperStat revenue and a $0.7 million increase in software licenses and miscellaneous hardware. Digital control unit and SuperStat shipments to third-party customers were approximately 101,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 104,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 3%. Our Smart Grid Solutions Group also produced approximately 32,000 digital control units for the year ended December 31, 2006 for our Alternative Energy Resources Group compared to 66,000 digital control units for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 51% decrease.

Our Alternative Energy Resources Group had revenue of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $8.8 million, or 100%. A $7.8 million increase in revenue from our VPC contracts resulted from providing 175 megawatts of estimated available capacity as of December 31, 2006 compared to 101 megawatts of available capacity as of December 31, 2005. In addition, there was a $1.0 million increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to program management services that we began providing in 2005. These multiple element arrangements do not qualify for separate accounting for each element and, therefore, revenue is recognized over the life of the contract.
As discussed above, we defer revenue and direct cost under our VPC contracts until such revenue can be made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test, generally in our fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, we recognized VPC contract revenue of $8.5 million and $16.3 million, respectively.

As a percentage of revenue, total gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased to 50% from 49% for the year ended December 31, 2005. An increase of higher-margin VPC contract revenue attributable to our Alternative Energy Resources Group and an increase in higher-margin digital control unit sales from our Smart Grid Solutions Group resulted in an increased total gross margin.
Gross profit for our Smart Grid Solutions Group was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.3 million, or 25%. Increased revenue contributed $0.6 million in additional gross profit. An increased gross margin percentage resulting from the increase in higher margin service revenue contributed $0.7 million in additional gross profit.
Gross profit for our Alternative Energy Resources Group was $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $4.2 million, or 66%. The gross margin of our Alternative Energy Resources Group varies due to factors that significantly impact revenue and cost of revenue but do not necessarily reflect on the underlying profitability of our VPC contracts. These factors include:
 
 	•	 	
The responsibility to pay participant incentives.    In two of our four VPC contracts in effect as of December 31, 2006, we are responsible for paying participant incentives, which are included in our cost

of revenue. In our other two VPC contracts in effect as of December 31, 2006, our utility customers are responsible for paying participant incentives. For the former two contracts, our revenue is higher than the latter two contracts because we have to recover the incentive cost plus a return on the capital employed. Consequently, the gross margin will be lower, but the gross profit will be greater for contracts under which we have the responsibility to pay incentives compared to contracts under which our utility customers are required to make the payments.
 
 	•	 	
We depreciate our VPC program capital equipment over the remaining contract life, which is shorter than the economic life of such equipment.    As a result, the annual depreciation charge per kilowatt of capacity installed will increase over the term of a VPC contract, while the revenue per kilowatt of capacity for any contract year will be determined by other factors that bear no relation to the depreciation.

 
 	•	 	
Residential VPC contract or commercial and industrial VPC contract.    Commercial and industrial VPC programs typically have a lower gross margin percentage because the financial incentive paid to a participating business is greater than the amount paid under residential VPC programs. Conversely, the customer acquisition costs incurred under a commercial and industrial VPC program are lower than under a residential VPC program.

Our Alternative Energy Resource Group’s gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 60% compared to 72% for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 17%. During 2006, we added approximately 23 megawatts of commercial and industrial VPC contract capacity, which has a lower gross margin than residential VPC contract capacity.

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $2.5 million, or 23%. The increase was the result of a $1.4 million increase in compensation expenses related to additional employees and bonus expense, and $1.1 million for increased professional fees. General and administrative expenses in 2006 included approximately $0.3 million (noncash) associated with our January 1, 2006 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123(R), which requires expensing of stock-based compensation.
Marketing and Selling Expenses
Marketing and selling expenses were $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.0 million, or 14%. Increased new customer acquisition expenses of $0.4 million under our VPC contracts, additional expenses of $0.4 million for sales managers hired to support our Smart Grid Solutions Group’s selling efforts, $0.1 million in increased trade show and periodical advertising expense, and $0.1 million in increased travel expenses contributed to the increase. Our

marketing costs will continue to increase as we add participants to our existing and future VPC programs. Once we reach full build-out under a VPC program, customer acquisition costs decrease significantly for that program.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses are incurred primarily in connection with the identification, testing and development of new Smart Grid products. Research and development expenses were $1.1 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The $0.3 million decrease in research and development expense in 2006 related to personnel reductions in our Israel engineering center during 2006.
Interest Expense, Net
Net interest expense increased from $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to an increase in interest expense of $0.2 million related to our convertible debt issued in June 2005 and a $0.1 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower average cash balances.
Income Taxes
No provision for income taxes was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2005 because we had net operating loss carryforwards that resulted in deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2006, a provision of $46,000 was recorded related to a deferred tax liability. We provided a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets because the realization of any future tax benefits could not be sufficiently assured as of December 31, 2005 or 2006.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we had revenue of $23.4 million compared to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $6.1 million, or 35%. A $1.5 million decrease in revenue from our Smart Grid Solutions Group was offset by a $7.6 million increase in revenue from our Alternative Energy Resources Group as a result of a 59 megawatt increase in capacity under our VPC programs. This 59 megawatt increase in capacity also contributed to the increase in deferred revenue.
Smart Grid Solutions Group Revenue

digital control units and Maingate products decreased $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, as utility customers fulfilled their internal program goals for the amount of installations desired. Digital control unit and SuperStat shipments to third-party customers were approximately 101,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 134,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of 25%. Our Smart Grid Solutions Group also produced 66,000 digital control units for the year ended December 31, 2005 for our Alternative Energy Resources Group compared to 30,000 digital control units for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 120%. Partially offsetting decreased digital control unit and Maingate sales were increased thermostat sales of $0.3 million as a result of the launch of our new SuperStat product resulting from our strategic alliance with the White-Rodgers division of Emerson Electric Company and a $0.2 million increase in installation revenue.
Alternative Energy Resources Group Revenue
Our Alternative Energy Resources Group had revenue of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $7.6 million, or 658%. A $7.4 million increase in revenue from our VPC contracts accounted for the increase for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 101 megawatts of estimated available capacity under our VPC contracts compared to 42 megawatts of estimated available capacity as of December 31, 2004. We defer revenue and direct cost under our VPC contracts until such revenue can be made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test, generally in our fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, we recognized VPC contract revenue of $1.2 million and $8.5 million, respectively.

As a percentage of revenue, total gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased to 49% from 44% for the year ended December 31, 2004. An increase in higher-margin VPC contract revenue attributable to our Alternative Energy Resources Group resulted in the gross margin rate increasing on a consolidated basis.
Gross profit for our Smart Grid Solutions Group was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 23%. Lower sales of our products contributed $0.6 million to the gross profit decline. An increase in lower margin SuperStat revenue and a decrease in higher-margin digital control unit sales accounted for the remainder of the gross profit decline.
Gross profit for our Alternative Energy Resources Group was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1.0 million the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $5.4 million, or 549%. Our Alternative Energy Resources Group’s gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 72% compared to 85% for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of 15%. The primary reasons for this

General and administrative expenses were $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $3.1 million, or 38%. An increase in the
number of employees as of December 31, 2005 contributed to a $1.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses resulting from increased compensation expenses. Higher operating expenses of $1.0 million to support our VPC programs contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses. In addition, travel expenses were $0.2 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. General and administrative expenses in 2005 included approximately $0.1 million of noncash stock-based compensation related to restricted stock granted to executive officers.
Marketing and Selling Expenses
Marketing and selling expenses were $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 6%. Lower headcount dedicated to marketing and selling efforts during 2005 resulted in a $1.1 million decrease in expenses compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. This was partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in advertising expenses, which were incurred to enroll participants in our VPC programs.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were essentially unchanged from the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2005.
Interest Expense, Net
Net interest expense decreased from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to an increase in interest income of $0.2 million related to higher average cash balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $74,000 from higher average debt balances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004.

allowance for our deferred tax assets because the realization of any future tax benefits could not be sufficiently assured as of December 31, 2004 or 2005.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
From April 2003, when we ceased being a wholly owned subsidiary of Acorn Factor, through our initial public offering in April 2007, we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of an aggregate of $40.9 million in preferred stock, $4.0 million in subordinated convertible debt and borrowings under our senior loan agreement and General Electric Capital Corporation credit facility as described below. We used these proceeds to fund our operations and to invest in our VPC programs, both in the form of capital expenditures to build out the capacity under our VPC contracts and participant acquisition expenses such as advertising and customer referral payments, which were expensed as incurred. In April 2007, we completed an initial public offering of 5,300,000 shares of our common stock. Aggregate proceeds to us from the offering were $86.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In conjunction with the completion of our initial public offering, the holder of our then only outstanding subordinated convertible debt converted $1.0 million of the principal balance into 138,121 shares of common stock. We used the net proceeds received from the offering, along with cash generated from operations and availability under our senior loan agreement and General Electric Capital Corporation credit facility to fund operations, capital expenditures, repay certain indebtedness and fund the cash portion of any future potential acquisitions. Management believes that available cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings available under our credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
Cash Flows

Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities
We have had operating losses since 2004 primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses for our VPC programs and the marketing and selling expenses incurred to acquire new participants in those programs. These expenses have been recorded when incurred. We expect to incur significant participant acquisition expenses until our VPC programs are fully developed to their contractual capacity limits and thereafter, we expect to incur less significant participant acquisition expenses as required to replace participants who withdraw from our VPC programs.
Cash used in operating activities was $7.7 million and $3.9 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was due to a $4.1 million decrease in other operating assets and liabilities partially offset by $0.3 million increase in net loss, excluding noncash stock-based compensation.

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

Cash used in operating activities was $7.0 million, $5.2 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The $4.0 million decrease in cash used in operating activities for year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted from a $1.8 million decrease in our net loss, which included an additional $1.4 million of depreciation and amortization, a $1.4 million increase in prepaid expenses, deferred costs and other assets and a $0.3 million increase in accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue of $1.6 million.
Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $1.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was the result of a $1.3 million reduction in the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, together with a $0.3 million increase in the provision for inventory obsolescence, a $0.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the expansion of our VPC programs and a $0.1 million increase in noncash stock compensation expense related to restricted stock, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in net working capital changes.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $2.8 million and $58.5 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2007, respectively, and was $4.2 million, $4.9 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Following our initial public offering, proceeds were invested in marketable securities. Net purchases of marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2007, were $32.4 million. The acquisitions of Enerwise and PES used $23.8 million in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and capital expenditures to build out and expand our VPC programs were $2.3 million. Installation services are purchased from third-party vendors and represent the installation of the demand response hardware at participants’ locations, primarily residential. With $4.2 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2004, estimated available capacity was expanded to approximately 42 megawatts by the end of 2004. A further $4.9 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased the estimated available capacity under our VPC programs to approximately 101 megawatts by the end of 2005. As of December 31, 2006, the estimated available capacity under our VPC contracts was approximately 175 megawatts following capital expenditures of $3.8 million in 2006. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, $2.3 million in capital expenditures increased estimated installed capacity under the VPC contracts to 227 megawatts. Our Smart Grid Solutions Group utilizes contract manufacturers for the production of our products, thereby resulting in minimal capital investment in that segment.
Noncash Investing Activities
Due to intercompany purchases of certain assets, the levels of capital expenditures reflected in the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows do not reflect the levels of capital investment made by us. Our Alternative Energy Resources Group purchases demand response equipment from our Smart Grid Solutions Group. These assets are initially classified as inventory when purchased by the Smart Grid Solutions Group. When transferred to the Alternative Energy Resources Group, they remain classified as inventory until they are deployed to service a VPC contract, at which time they are re-classified as a capital asset. These noncash purchases of equipment were $1.3 million and $0.5 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2007, respectively, and were $0.7 million, $1.8 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006. The decrease in noncash purchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to the prior year period reflects reaching full capacity build out in three of our VPC contracts in 2007. The increase in noncash purchases in 2005 and 2006 is directly related to the growth of our VPC programs.
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities
Cash flows provided by financing activities were $9.0 million and $88.7 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2007, respectively, and were $15.3 million, $4.0 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the

 	•	 	
sale of Series A and Series B convertible preferred stock in 2004, with net proceeds of $16.6 million, a portion of which was used to repay $1.3 million of long-term debt.

Working Capital
Working capital as of September 30, 2007, was $41.8 million, consisting of $86.8 million in current assets and $45.0 million in current liabilities. Working capital as of December 31, 2006 was $1.1 million, consisting of $15.5 million in current assets and $14.4 million in current liabilities. Working capital as of December 31, 2005 was $3.1 million, consisting of $13.6 million in current assets and $10.5 million in current liabilities.
In addition, we had aggregate available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and our senior loan agreement of $37.6 million as of September 30, 2007, $3.8 million as of December 31, 2006 and $4.3 million as of December 31, 2005, based upon the borrowing base calculated pursuant to the formula described below.

In January 2007, our Alternative Energy Resources Group subsidiary entered into a credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation to provide it with up to $40 million of borrowings to fund capital expenditures related to our VPC contracts. This credit agreement expires in 2014, at which time all outstanding borrowings will become due and payable. Subject to the limitations described below, this credit agreement has a term loan facility up to $37.0 million and a letter of credit facility up to $3.0 million. Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either prime plus 1.5% or LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum, at our election. Borrowings under this credit agreement are collateralized by all of the Alternative Energy Resources Group’s assets, including its intellectual property. Borrowings under this credit agreement can be requested, from time to time during the first three years of the agreement, for up to 90% of capital expenditures incurred under a VPC contract. This credit agreement contains customary financial and restrictive covenants, including maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio and a prohibition on the payment of dividends. We were in compliance with these

covenants as of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006. As of September 30, 2007, there was $3.4 million of borrowings under this credit agreement, and borrowing availability to fund capital expenditures for the VPC contracts was $33.6 million.
Senior Loan Agreement.    In April 2003, we entered into a loan and security agreement, as amended, or the senior loan agreement, with Silicon Valley Bank. The senior loan agreement expires in March 2008, at which time all outstanding borrowings will become due and payable. Subject to the limitations described below, the senior loan agreement has a revolving line of credit up to $4.0 million, including letters of credit up to $3.0 million. Borrowings under the senior loan agreement bear interest at either prime plus 2.0% or prime plus 2.75% per annum depending on our performance under a financial covenant contained in the agreement. The senior loan agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets not related to our Alternative Energy Resources Group, including our intellectual property. Borrowings under the senior loan agreement can be requested, from time to time, up to an amount that, based on a formula, includes (1) up to 80% of eligible receivables and (2) eligible inventory limited to the lesser of (A) 25% of their value, (B) 80% of net orderly liquidation value, (C) $0.5 million or (D) 25% of the aggregate eligible accounts outstanding. The senior loan agreement contains customary financial and restrictive covenants, including maintenance of a minimum quick ratio and EBITDA level and a prohibition on the payment of dividends. We were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006. As of September 30, 2007, we had no borrowings under the senior loan agreement and availability of approximately $4.0 million based upon the borrowing base calculated pursuant to the formula described above. Following the completion of our initial public offering the $1.0 million outstanding under the senior loan agreement was repaid.
Subordinated Convertible Loan Agreement.    In June 2005, we entered into a $4.0 million subordinated convertible loan agreement, or the subordinated convertible debt, with Partners for Growth, L.P. As of December 31, 2006, $4.0 million of principal remained outstanding under the convertible debt. In conjunction with our initial public offering in April 2007, the lender converted $1.0 million in principal into 138,121 shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2007, $3.0 million of principal remained outstanding under the convertible debt. The remaining convertible debt under this agreement matures in June 2010. The convertible debt bears interest at 3% plus the three-month LIBOR rate. The convertible debt requires payment of interest only, provided that we meet or exceed certain pro forma revenue targets calculated on a quarterly basis during the term. If we do not meet or exceed such revenue targets, at the option of the lender, the convertible debt will amortize ratably over a two-year period or such lesser period as remains until the maturity date. No principal payments have been required to date, and none are expected to be required during 2007. The lender may convert the principal amount of the convertible debt into our common stock at a price of $7.24 per share at any time during the term of the convertible debt. We have the right to convert the principal amount of the convertible debt under the same terms, as a result of the completion of our initial public offering of our common stock. The entire principal amount of the convertible debt may be prepaid at any time, provided that the payment must include an amount calculated to compensate the lender for interest that would have been paid through the maturity date of the convertible debt, determined by multiplying the principal balance by the current interest rate for each interest paying period from the prepayment date to the maturity date and then discounting the result at an annual rate of 20%. In addition, in the event of a prepayment of the principal amount, the lender has been provided a non-detachable warrant to purchase 414,364 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.24 per share. The convertible debt is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of our assets and is subordinated in right of payment to the senior loan agreement. The convertible debt contains customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2007 and as of December 31, 2006.
Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes
In connection with our acquisition of Enerwise, we issued a series of subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $17.0 million. The notes bear interest at a rate of 5.5% per annum and mature on April 1, 2009. Interest payments on the notes will be made by us quarterly. The notes will be convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holders thereof beginning one year from the date

of issuance at a price per share of $33.44 which represents 125% of the average closing price of our common stock for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the execution of the Enerwise merger agreement. Based on the note conversion price of $33.44 per share, the notes would be convertible into an aggregate of up to 508,373 shares of our common stock.
In connection with our acquisition of PES, we issued a series of subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 million. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.5% per annum and will mature on March 29, 2009. Interest payments on the notes will be made by us quarterly. The notes are convertible into 74,386 shares of our common stock at the option of the holders thereof beginning one year from the date of issuance at a price per share of $40.33, which is equal to 125% of the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days commencing September 18, 2007, and ending October 12, 2007.
Letters of Credit
Our senior loan agreement and our credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation provide for the issuance of up to $7.0 million of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had $0.5 million face value of irrevocable letters of credit outstanding, and as of September 30, 2007, we had $2.8 million face value of irrevocable letters of credit outstanding.
Capital Spending
As of September 30, 2007 our VPC programs had estimated installed capacity of 227 megawatts, and as of December 31, 2006, our VPC programs had estimated installed capacity of 175 megawatts. Our existing VPC contracts as of September 30, 2007 provided for a contracted capacity of 492 megawatts and as of December 31, 2006, our VPC contracts provided for a contracted capacity of 220 megawatts. We expect to incur approximately $35.1 million in capital expenditures over the next three years to build out the remaining megawatts under our existing VPC programs, of which $8.7 million is anticipated to be incurred through December 31, 2007. If we are successful in being awarded additional VPC contracts, we would incur additional amounts to build out those new VPC programs.
Commitments and Contingencies
We are a party to various legal proceedings and claims of which the outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty. Our policy is to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the liability required, if any, for these contingencies is made after an analysis of each known issue in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and related pronouncements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, a liability is recorded when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose contingencies for which a material loss is reasonably possible, but not probable. As of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, there were no material contingencies requiring accrual or disclosure.

 	(1)	 	In May 2006, we negotiated a supply agreement with an electric utility that had previously executed contracts with certain of its large commercial and industrial customers to permit direct load control of certain devices and equipment located in their operating facilities. Under the terms of the supply agreement, the electric utility caused this direct load to be registered as a demand response resource under our VPC contract with ISO New England Inc. The amounts in the table represent our contractual commitment to pay the electric utility for the registered load under the two-year term of the supply agreement. Such amounts are included in our cost of revenue.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
Foreign Exchange Risk
We face minimal exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Historically, our primary exposures have related to non dollar-denominated sales and expenses in the Canadian dollar and the Israeli shekel. We do not utilize any foreign currency exchange transactions to hedge our exposure. Foreign currency gain (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 were ($4,000), $14,000 and $16,000, respectively.
Interest Rate Risk
As of September 30, 2007, $20.0 million of our outstanding debt was at fixed interest rates and $7.6 million of outstanding debt was at floating interest rates. Based on outstanding floating rate debt of $7.6 million as of September 30, 2007 an increase of 1.0% in the prime rate or the three-month LIBOR rate would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately $76,000 per year.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we re-evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, the collectability of receivables, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes and stock-

based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth below.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenues when the following criteria have been met: delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, collection is probable, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.
In accordance with SAB 104, the Company defers revenue and associated cost of revenue in its Alternative Energy Resources Group segment related to certain long-term VPC contracts until such time as the annual contract price is fixed and determinable. Revenue is invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis throughout the contract year. The VPC contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers, and require a measurement and verification of such capacity on an annual basis in order to determine final contract consideration for a given contract year. Contract years begin at the end of a control season (generally, at the end of a utility’s summer cooling season that correlates to the end of the utility’s peak demand for electricity) and continue for twelve months thereafter.
The Company, through the acquisition of PES, enters into agreements to provide base load capacity services to utilities or commercial and industrial end customers. Base load capacity revenues are earned based on the Company’s ability to achieve committed capacity through load reduction. In order to provide capacity, the Company delivers and installs demand side management measures to a portfolio of commercial and industrial end customers. The base load capacity contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers, and include a measurement and verification of such capacity in order to determine contract consideration. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company defers revenue and associated cost of revenue in its electric load reduction services until such time as the capacity amount and therefore the related revenue is fixed and determinable. Once the capacity amount has been verified, the revenue is recognized. If the revenue is subject to penalty, refund or an ongoing obligation, the revenue is deferred until the liability is resolved and/or the Company has met its performance obligation.
The Enerwise Group segment enters into agreements to provide demand response and capacity event services. The demand response contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility end customers when the utility calls a demand response event to curtain electrical usage. Demand response revenues are earned based on the Company’s ability to deliver capacity. In order to provide capacity, the Company manages a portfolio of commercial and industrial end users’ electric loads. Capacity amounts are verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a customer initiated demand response test. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company recognizes revenue and associated cost of revenue in its demand response services at such time as the capacity amount and therefore the related revenue is fixed and determinable.
Capacity event services revenue is contingent revenue earned based upon actual amount of energy provided during the capacity event. Contingent revenue from capacity events are recognized when the capacity amount is fixed and determinable.
The Smart Grid Solutions Group sells hardware products directly to utilities for use and deployment by the utility. In addition, it provides installation services under a long-term service contract with one of our customers. The Company recognizes revenue for such sales when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and all other criteria of SAB 104 have been met.
Inventories
Inventories include raw materials and finished goods. Items are removed from inventory using the first-in, first-out method. We utilize contract manufacturers to assemble all of our products. Inventory amounts include the expense to manufacture the item, such as the expense of raw materials, labor and other applied direct and

indirect expenses. We also review freight, handling expenses and wasted materials to determine if abnormal amounts should be recognized as current-period charges. We review our inventory for obsolescence and marketability. If the estimated market value, which is based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions, falls below the original expense, the inventory value is reduced to the market value. If technology rapidly changes or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management, inventory write-downs may be required.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the underlying receivables, our historical experience with write-offs and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations, and we believe appropriate reserves have been established, we may not adequately predict future credit losses. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. All of our identifiable intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. We use estimates in determining the value of goodwill and intangible assets, including estimates of useful lives of intangible assets, discounted future cash flows and fair values of the related operations. We test goodwill for impairment each year as of December 31, under the guidance of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We forecast discounted future cash flows at the reporting unit level, which consists of our operating segments, based on estimated future revenues and operating expenses, which take into consideration factors such as estimated payments on long-term contracts, expected future orders, supplier contracts and general market conditions. Changes in our forecasts or expense of capital may result in asset value adjustments, which could have a significant affect on our current and future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Stock-Based Compensation
As of January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which requires us to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that estimates are revised. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of assumptions, including the fair market value of our common stock, the estimated length of time that employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term), and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, stock options were granted with exercise prices ranging from $0.58 per share to $10.88 per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the fair value of the common stock was determined by us contemporaneously with the grants based on valuations performed by an independent valuation firm, Duff & Phelps LLC, and the price paid for our Series C convertible preferred stock. After June 30, 2006, through April 13, 2007, the date our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market, we considered a number of factors in determining the fair market value of the common stock, including the valuation performed by Duff & Phelps LLC as of June 30, 2006, the increasing likelihood that we would pursue a public offering, and valuation indications for our common stock received from our investment bankers, which included operating and financial performance factors.

Accounting for Income Taxes
We have incurred net losses since our inception. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires companies to recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets, primarily resulting from net operating loss and credit carryforwards, and adjust our valuation allowance, if necessary.
Once we utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, we would expect our provision for income tax expense in future periods to reflect an effective tax rate that will be significantly higher than past periods. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will potentially result in tax benefits that are currently difficult to predict.
Legal Contingencies
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims of which the outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty. Our policy is to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the liability required, if any, for these contingencies is made after an analysis of each known issue in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related pronouncements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, a liability is recorded when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose contingencies for which a material loss is reasonably possible but less than probable.
New Accounting Pronouncements
SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R))
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 123(R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.
In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB No. 107) which summarizes the views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations. SAB No. 107 provides guidance on several topics, including valuation methods, the classification of compensation expense, capitalization of compensation expenses related to share-based payment arrangements,

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

the accounting for income tax effects of share-based payment arrangements, and disclosures in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” subsequent to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
In April 2005, the SEC issued FR-74, Amendment to Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X Regarding the Compliance Date for Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (FR-74). FR-74 allows companies to implement SFAS No. 123(R) at the beginning of their next fiscal year (January 1, 2006 for us), instead of the next reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. FR-74 does not change the accounting required by SFAS No. 123(R); it only changes the implementation date of the standard.
We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the prospective method on January 1, 2006. We cannot predict the level of its impact since it will depend upon the level of share-based payments granted in the future. However, we generally expect compensation expense to increase.
SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 39 (SFAS No. 154)
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle or correction of an error. It requires, unless impracticable, retrospective application of the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We implemented SFAS No. 154 effective January 1, 2006.
SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (SFAS No. 157)
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements, but standardizes its definition and guidance in GAAP. SFAS No. 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and not an entity-specific measurement based on an exchange transaction in which the entity sells an asset or transfers a liability (exit price). SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest level to fair value based on an entity’s own fair value assumptions as the lowest level. SFAS No. 157 is to be effective for our financial statements issued in 2008. We believe that SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159)
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. A business entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the faire value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe that SFAS No. 159 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48)
On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB 109. Based on the analysis performed, we did not record any unrecognized tax positions as of January 1, 2007 or September 30, 2007.

BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are a clean energy company providing peaking and base load capacity to electric utilities, grid operators and associated electricity markets. As an alternative to the traditional method of providing capacity by building a new power plant, we deliver our capacity through implementation of demand management solutions that decrease energy consumption. The capacity we deliver is more environmentally friendly and less expensive than conventional alternatives and has the benefit of increasing overall system reliability. Our solutions are designed, built and operated for the benefit of our customers, which include electric utilities and grid operators that serve residential, commercial and industrial consumers. We provide capacity to our customers either through long-term contracts where we actively manage demand or by selling our demand response systems to utilities that operate them. We believe we are the largest provider of capacity through these means, as we currently own or manage approximately 1,445 megawatts of capacity.
We serve the clean energy market through three operating units, the Alternative Energy Resources Group, the Enerwise Group and the Smart Grid Solutions Group. Through our Alternative Energy Resources Group, we offer outsourced services, including our Virtual Peaking Capacity, or VPC, programs, as well as our base load capacity programs, which provide electric capacity to our customers. We provide this capacity by developing, operating and managing residential, commercial and industrial energy load management systems through long-term, pay-for-performance contracts. Our VPC programs provide electric capacity during periods of peak energy demand by remotely operating high energy-consuming devices, such as central air conditioners, electric water heaters and pool pumps. Our recent acquisition of Public Energy Solutions, LLC and its related entities, which we refer to as PES, also allows us to offer permanent base load reduction programs, for example more energy efficient light bulbs and energy usage control systems, for commercial and industrial customers under long-term, pay-for-performance contracts with a utility. We refer to our seven VPC contracts and our base load reduction program collectively as our capacity contracts. When we refer to the megawatts of contracted capacity or estimated payments associated with our VPC contracts or our capacity contracts, we exclude our VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company. The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control denied this VPC contract, as initially submitted, on November 9, 2007. We are working with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to extend the term of the agreement to allow the parties to amend and resubmit the agreement for approval within the parameters suggested by the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control. There is no guarantee that we will be able to agree to an amendment or ultimately receive regulatory approval.

Industry Overview
Our market opportunity exists in one of the largest industries in the world. In North America, electric utilities had estimated sales of $275 billion in 2005 according to the Center for Smart Energy. On a worldwide basis, utilities will need to invest an estimated $10 trillion in generation, transmission and distribution assets between 2005 and 2030 in order to meet expected demand according to the International Energy Agency. The deployment of this capital is driven by various factors facing the electric utilities industry. These factors include:
 
 	•	 	
transmission and distribution constraints;

 
 	•	 	
aging infrastructure;

 
 	•	 	
insufficient generation assets to meet increasing energy demand;

 
 	•	 	
tightening reserve margins;

 
 	•	 	
high and volatile commodity prices;

 
 	•	 	
an increasing rate environment; and

 
 	•	 	
environmental and regulatory concerns.

These factors are likely to continue to put upward pressure on electricity prices and increase costs to consumers. If utilities are required to promote energy efficiency programs, their revenues may be affected in a number of ways. Electric utilities do not receive the same return for saving energy as they do for building a new power plant and electric utilities may seek to change state laws and regulations to allow utilities to earn the same return. One way state public utility commissions can address these new costs associated with additional capital expenditures is by providing cost recovery treatment to electric utilities. Through these rate treatments, consumers will likely still pay a higher rate for electricity, but it will be much less than if the utility were building a new power plant.

As a utility’s load, or the total amount of electricity consumed by its customers, increases it must generate or procure increasingly expensive power to satisfy this load. Generally, the price of electricity varies by the time of day and time of year it is consumed. Peak pricing periods typically occur daily as a result of heavy consumption in the afternoon and evening and seasonally as a result of extreme temperatures in summer and winter months. During critical peak periods, the cost of providing such power often exceeds $50 per megawatt hour, which is more than ten times the cost of power provided by base load power plants. During extreme peaks, this cost can soar to $1,000 per megawatt hour or more. As a typical example, the graphic below illustrates the 2005 cost structure for the New York ISO, an organization of the state’s largest utilities and a member of the North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC. As depicted below, base load energy is traditionally provided by hydro, coal and nuclear energy sources. As demand for electricity increases during periods of peak energy consumption, other sources of supply-side capacity are utilized. These sources, such as natural gas-fired plants, have increasingly expensive variable costs, driving up the cost of power.

Key Drivers to Electric Utility Industry Capital Expenditures
Transmission and Distribution Constraints.    Under-investment in new transmission and distribution assets and the increased demand for energy have resulted in an over-burdened electric grid, periodically preventing the movement of power to needed areas during peak times. Many areas of the U.S. do not have enough transmission lines installed to distribute energy during periods of high electricity demand. Furthermore, utilities often lack the requisite technology that allows them to monitor and manage power distribution efficiently. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, major transmission constraints at 16 specific locations in the U.S. electric transmission system cost consumers approximately $700 million in electricity costs during the summers

of 2000 and 2001. These costly strains on the grid system are exacerbated by the continuing lack of transmission investment. Research conducted in 2006 by NERC, estimated a 19% expansion in U.S. electricity demand through 2016, but estimated an increase of only 6% in transmission and distribution capacity over the same period.
Aging Infrastructure.    According to Harbor Research, Inc., there has not been any material capital investment in electricity transmission assets (power lines, transformers, etc.) in the past decade, and at least 60% of the current infrastructure needs to be replaced. A separate study conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute estimates that $50 billion to $100 billion will be required over the next 10 years to enhance the North American transmission and distribution grid to the levels required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
Insufficient Generation Assets to Meet Increasing Energy Demand.    According to the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, overall electricity consumption in 2030 is expected to increase by at least 40% from today’s level. In order to support this increased level of demand, the EIA estimates 258 gigawatts of new generating capacity will be needed by 2030. According to Global Energy Decisions, even the near-term supply of electricity from planned generation projects in the next 12 months will not be sufficient to keep pace with the expected incremental demand in 2009, requiring the need for investment in additional facilities or new technology to address this shortfall. The graphic below, constructed using data from Global Energy Decisions, highlights the incremental demand (2007 as the base year) and the expected available capacity from currently planned generation projects coming online. This graphic illustrates the emerging gap in anticipated load demand and industry capacity.

Tightening Reserve Margins.    Reserve margin, or reserve capacity, is defined as a level of available capacity over and above the capacity needed to meet normal peak demand levels. Grid operators establish the margin levels, which are then monitored by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure reliable system performance. A margin reserve of 15% or greater is generally considered to be the industry benchmark. Reserve margin levels have and will continue to experience pressure from both increasing base load demand and lack of capacity expansion. According to North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC, the reserve margin levels of several regional grid operators will fall below the minimum target reserve level in the near term. For example, the committed resources of grid operators Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, New England Power Pool, or NEPOOL, and Midwest Reliability Organization, or MRO, currently provide capacity at or below targeted margin levels, requiring additional capacity or energy management solutions to be developed and integrated into the system. Without the addition of new generation capacity or energy management solutions, their respective reserve margin levels will continue to be depressed. In the case of ERCOT, this trend could potentially result in not only a dangerously low reserve margin, but also an actual shortfall in generation within the next five to seven years. The graphic below, generated from data from the NERC, depicts the expected reserve margin levels at three major regional grid operators with current committed capacity.
LOGO
High and Volatile Commodity Prices.    Electric utilities generally use natural gas-fired power plants to meet peak energy demand needs. According to the American Gas Foundation, a decrease in the overall natural gas supply has resulted in considerable price volatility. Natural gas prices have ranged from a high of approximately $13.00 per million British thermal units, or mmBtu, to a low of approximately $5.00 per mmBtu since 2004. Electric utilities have sought to diversify the sources used to generate the electricity that they provide to their consumers in an effort to manage their exposure to the higher fuel costs of natural gas, while at the same time preserving their ability to serve periods of peak energy demand.

Increasing Rate Environment.    In the current environment, many investor owned utilities have had to increase capital expenditures, not only to maintain system reliability by replacing aging infrastructure, but also to bring new generating capacity online to meet increasing load growth. This trend will put upward pressure on rates and commodity prices in regulated and competitive states, respectively. It will be primarily the task of the state public utility commissions to keep rates from rising too rapidly while continuing to enforce high reliability and safety standards. In order to manage this demand versus price dynamic, utilities will need to reduce costs through more energy efficiency and demand response solutions. Under regulatory pressures to moderate consumer electricity prices, utilities are increasingly seeking lower cost generating and capacity solutions. The graphic below, developed using data from Energy Information Administration, depicts both the trend of increasing rates and larger variations in the range of prices experienced in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The respective high, low and median prices for each sector are represented in the graphic.
 
LOGO
 
Environmental and Regulatory Concerns.    U.S. federal and state governments have enacted legislation aimed at reducing emissions associated with electric power generation, encouraging efficient energy consumption and mandating the use of renewable sources of power. One such state-level development has been the establishment of Renewable Portfolio Standards, or RPS, through which individual states mandate a specific percentage of total energy supply to be procured from renewable sources. Since 2001, when 6 states had initiatives in place, the standard has gained considerable traction as evidenced by the fact that 25 states plus the District of Columbia currently have RPS legislation in place, and an additional four states have adopted RPS goals. RPS requirements differ by state and at times include the use of energy efficiency and demand response technologies to satisfy the RPS requirement. Additionally, Energy Efficient Resource Standards, or EERS, are becoming increasingly common as ways to effect conservation policy. The graphic below, generated from data compiled from the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy and American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, depicts the current U.S. landscape in regards to state participation in the RPS and EERS programs. Significant capital expenditures will be required to meet the requirements of both programs, with energy efficiency and demand response sectors potentially benefiting from this investment.

The Growing Clean Energy Sector
The clean energy sector has evolved in direct response to the needs of electric utilities to pursue alternative forms of energy and to better manage the production and consumption of electricity in light of the challenges described above. We estimate that the total clean energy market in which we participate is $7.4 billion annually. We define this sector, with estimated accumulated revenues of $300 billion between 2005 and 2010, as being comprised of three segments:
 
 	•	 	
alternative energy resources;

 
 	•	 	
smart grid technology; and

 
 	•	 	
conservation and efficiency.

We currently provide solutions in each of these three segments.

Alternative Energy Resources refers to alternatives to fossil fuel-based methods of providing electricity, including demand response and other resources that do not create harmful emissions. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the amount of global investment in renewable energy technologies reached over $70 billion in 2006, a 40% increase from 2005. Traditionally, alternative energy resources in the clean energy sector have been viewed as primarily consisting of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar. More recently, the scope of alternative energy resources has expanded to include the electric capacity provided through demand management programs. Based on our average annual capacity value of $70/kW-yr and the average demand response needed on an annual basis, we estimate the market opportunity to be $3.4 billion.
The benefits of our VPC and demand capacity offerings effectively arise from opportunities associated with patterns in electricity consumption. The aggregate North American peak electricity demand was estimated by North American Electric Reliability Council to be 750 gigawatts. The portion of this market demand generated from the residential, commercial and industrial sectors, based on historical median data from the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, is approximately 40% and 60%, respectively. This implies market sizes of approximately 300 gigawatts in the residential sector and 450 gigawatts in the combined commercial and industrial sectors. The capacity to be served by demand response is estimated to be 5-8% of the total peak demand in the residential market and 5-10% of the total peak demand in the commercial and industrial markets, according to a KEMA analysis. The graphic below indicates an approximate market opportunity ranging from 38—60 gigawatts in 2006. We expect this market opportunity to increase 1.5% per year, consistent with the EIA estimates of overall annual demand expansion.

Smart Grid Technology refers to the application of advanced technology, including wireless communications, for managing electricity production, distribution and consumption over a transmission and distribution network. More specifically, it refers to the use of hardware devices, software, electronics and advanced materials to modernize and optimize the electricity infrastructure for electric power delivery. The Center for Smart Energy estimates the worldwide grid infrastructure market reached $81 billion in 2005, of which $45 billion, or 56%, consisted of Smart Grid products. In North America, the smart grid market was approximately $2 billion in 2005, with a growth forecast above the worldwide average of 5% per year.
Conservation and Efficiency refers to the economic practice of reducing the use of energy. Some ways in which energy efficiency and conservation are achieved are through use of programmable thermostats, installation of insulation and use of more efficient lighting, motors and electrical equipment, all of which reduce consumption and help reduce peak and base load energy demand. According to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, or NAPEE, the U.S. could realize electricity savings of 24% of total usage through implementation of energy efficiency solutions across all sectors of the economy over the next 20 years. A similar study by the Interlaboratory Working Group concludes the achievable U.S. electrical energy savings from implementing efficient solutions through 2020 is approximately 22% of the expected consumption. To effectively realize these levels of savings, capital investment is required. The most recent estimate from NAPEE indicates $2.0 billion was invested in efficiency programs in 2005.
The Comverge Solution
Our clean energy solutions enable our electric utility industry customers to address the issues they currently confront on a daily basis, such as rising demand, decreasing supply, higher commodity prices, greater emphasis on the reduction of green house gases and emerging mandates to use energy efficiency solutions to address these issues. As illustrated in the chart below, Comverge offers solutions that help to reduce demand and capacity. For example, our energy efficiency offerings allow utilities to reduce base load capacity which helps to improve system reliability. We also provide demand response solutions that enable our customers to reduce demand for electricity during peak hours, when strain on the system is greatest.

More specifically, our solutions yield the following benefits to our electric utility industry customers:
Provides Alternative to Building Expensive New Plants and Associated Transmission and Distribution Infrastructure.    We reduce our customers’ capital expenditures and costs for electric transmission and distribution. Our solutions can be directly substituted for new power generation facilities that would otherwise be built to satisfy either peak periods of electricity demand or the expected increase in base load demand. Our Smart Grid solutions require significantly lower short-term capital expenditures than a natural gas-fired power plant, and our alternative energy solutions require no capital expenditures on the part of electric utilities. By avoiding the build-out of new generation, utilities can also avoid building the incremental new transmission and distribution assets needed to bring the power from the location where it is generated to where it is consumed, thereby further reducing required capital expenditures.
In order to encourage electricity providers to use alternative energy solutions instead of building assets, which would dramatically increase capital expenditure requirements of the electric utility industry and the rates paid by energy consumers, National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, or NAPEE, was created to provide a roadmap for all stakeholders, including businesses, utilities, environmentalists and consumers, with solutions and alternatives for substituting the traditional ways of building energy infrastructure for more cost effective and environmental friendly ways. NAPEE also presents policy recommendations for creating a sustainable, aggressive national commitment to energy efficiency by gas and electric utilities, utility regulators, and partner organizations. Most notably, NAPEE’s key recommendation was that policymakers and regulators should recognize energy efficiency as a high-priority energy resource.
The first state energy action plan in alignment with the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, or NAPEE, vision was introduced in California, where the goal is to meet California’s energy growth needs while optimizing energy conservation. The plan is also to decrease per capita energy use and reduce toxic emissions and greenhouse gases. Central to the California plan is the state’s preferred “Loading Order” for resource expansion. First, is energy efficiency and demand response; second, renewable generation; third, increased development of affordable and reliable conventional generation and fourth, is transmission expansion to support all of California’s energy goals. As a result, Californians have succeeded in attaining many of the energy conservation goals set forth, while at the same time reducing green house gases. As this model is carried into other states, we believe that we, as the leading capacity provider utilizing demand response and energy efficiency solutions, are well-positioned to enable our customers to meet the goals of emerging regulatory policies that recognize energy efficiency as a high-priority energy resource.
Improves System Reliability.    Our clean energy solutions enhance the reliability of the electric grid by providing the ability to reduce power consumption in specific distribution areas during times of peak energy demand and emergency conditions, thereby relieving strain on the aging grid infrastructure. With our systems, our customers gain the benefit of more reliable infrastructure and lower operating costs associated with fewer emergency maintenance and customer care issues. In addition to improving system reliability, our targeted approach focuses on specific distribution areas may also reduce or delay need for new capital investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure.
Shortens Time Required to Bring Needed Capacity Online.    Our solutions avoid the long lead times associated with siting, permitting and constructing a conventional power plant. A typical natural gas-fired power plant will take 30 to 36 months to site, permit and construct, whereas our solution provides an immediate benefit. Our ability to rapidly deploy our solutions could provide a critical solution in a situation where a utility is experiencing reserve margin pressure.
Increased Operational Flexibility for Utilities.    Our VPC programs become operational, or ramp up, much more rapidly than natural gas-fired power plants. In contrast to utilizing a peaking plant, which generally requires up to 30 minutes to reach full output, our clean energy solutions require less than five minutes to reduce and shift the amount of energy consumption. In addition, our technology enables devices to be controlled both individually

and in clusters, thereby allowing those devices to be operated at the time and location (i.e., at a substation, circuit or feeder) required to manage localized constraints and/or emergency conditions. For example, in 2004, we were awarded two contracts by ISO New England Inc. to own and operate a demand response system in order to help relieve severe transmission and distribution congestion in southwest Connecticut. Following the end of the contract period for the two ISO New England Inc. contracts, we were able to leverage that demand response system to offer new demand response programs in Connecticut. We are currently working with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control and two investor-owned utilities to design and implement demand response programs that utilize at least a portion of the assets utilized under the two ISO New England Inc. contracts. We signed the first such contract, which we expect to provide up to 130 megawatts of demand response capacity, with The Connecticut Light and Power Company on October 4, 2007. This contract is subject to regulatory approval. In November 2007, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control denied regulatory approval of this contract, as submitted. We are working with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to amend and resubmit this contract to the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control for approval.
Cost Savings for Electricity Consumers.    Certain of our solutions enable residential, commercial and industrial consumers to receive time-of-use electricity price signals, thereby allowing them to match electricity use with the costs to purchase such electricity. Consumers who deploy our solutions can realize cost savings on their electric bills by using less energy, particularly during peak periods when prices are the highest, or shifting their usage to times when electricity is less expensive. The largest such system in North America is the GoodCents Select Program operated by Gulf Power Company, Inc., a Southern Company utility located in Pensacola, Florida. Currently, Gulf Power has approximately 8,100 participants in the GoodCents Select Program representing 3.0% of their customer base. This system is anticipated to provide approximately 100 megawatts of capacity (which is equivalent to providing electricity for 100,000 homes) through customer choice by implementing a price responsive solution. Our Maingate Home product automatically curtails high-energy consumption devices based on pricing signals and customer programming. Utilities that use our Smart Grid solutions can reduce operating costs, which results in savings that can be passed along to the end customer. For example, the Electric Power Research Institute estimates that by shifting 2.5% of the peak load demand, California utilities could achieve a 24% reduction in the wholesale price of electricity. Tampa Electric operates a similar program, also utilizing our Maingate Home product.

Conservation and Clean Energy Solutions Create a Positive Environmental Impact.    Certain of our Smart Grid solutions and enrollment in our VPC programs allow consumers to conserve electricity by intelligently controlling overall consumption. Our demand response offerings provide electric utilities with very similar functionality to the peaking capacity typically provided by natural gas-fired power plants and the base load capacity typically provided by sources such as coal-fired power plants, while also providing one of the cleanest alternative energy resources in the clean energy spectrum. By reducing electricity demand during peak times, our VPC programs also have the potential to displace older, inefficient peaking power plants and can reduce the operating time of intermediate plants. By substituting our VPC programs for new natural gas-fired power generation facilities, utilities are able to conserve electricity and reduce greenhouse gases and pollutants. Below is a chart showing the per capita electricity sales comparing the United States versus California. In 2005, through its “Load Serving” approach to energy efficiency programs, California achieved total energy usage savings of approximately 5,300kWh/year. Over the past 30 years, per capita energy use for California has remained relatively flat compared to the 50% increase in overall per capita energy use for the United States.

Enable Electric Utilities to Meet Regulatory Mandates.    The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established as the official policy of the U.S. that states should coordinate, on a regional basis, state energy policies to provide reliable and affordable demand response services to the public. The act mandates that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy provide detailed assessments and recommendations for demand response initiatives. These federal agencies have in turn required state regulatory agencies to make assessments and evaluate their own demand response policies. We are working closely with state regulators and electric utilities to formulate and coordinate effective demand response solutions.
In the U.S., the Senate has on several occasions passed bills containing Renewable Portfolio Standards, or RPS, provisions that would require that 10% of U.S. electricity in 2020 come from renewable sources; however, due to opposition in the House of Representatives, RPS provisions were dropped from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Similarly, policymakers have been considering mandating Energy Efficient Resource Standards, or EERS, that would set energy efficiency and load management savings targets that electric and gas utilities must meet, with the targets gradually rising from year to year. There is also discussion of combining the RPS and EERS to increase flexibility. For example, Senators Bingaman of New Mexico and Landrieu of Louisiana jointly developed a bill that calls for 15% of U.S. electricity to come from energy efficiency and renewable sources, with efficiency allowed to contribute up to 27% of the total (e.g. up to 4% efficiency and at least 11% from renewables for a total of 15%).

One strategy utilities might employ to increase their ability to meet these renewable portfolio standards or energy efficient resource standards would be to push for mechanisms that would decouple the rates that regulators allow utilities to charge their consumers. As an example of decoupling, in California, state regulators set rates—and by extension determine utility revenues—without regard to the volume of a utility’s electricity sales, thereby removing economic disincentives for utilities to promote energy efficiency or demand response. California also has the most effective energy efficiency programs nationwide. Ultimately, as more and more states enact electricity decoupling, the greater the usage of energy efficiency and demand response services will be needed to meet the new RPS and EERS standards.
Comverge Competitive Strengths
Compelling Value Proposition to Electric Utilities and Consumers.    For electric utilities, we offer an attractive peak power solution that provides electric capacity that is as much as 40% less expensive to build and operate than a natural gas-fired peaking power plant. Currently, there are 150 proposed coal-fired power plants to be built in the United States at a total cost of approximately $137 billion. If those funds were invested into energy efficiency programs, they could reduce U.S. electricity demand by about 19% by 2025, obviating the need for additional coal plants. Our solution is also as much as 90% less expensive than other forms of alternative energy, such as solar, that require governmental subsidies in order to remain competitive. We create additional value for electric utilities by reducing peak-time power spikes and improving grid reliability. Our technology also provides residential, commercial and industrial consumers with the ability to conserve energy and reduce their electricity costs through the implementation of energy efficiency and programs. This further enhances the ability of electric utilities to build fewer power plants and conserve capital resources.
A Market Leader in the Clean Energy Sector.    From inception through September 30, 2007, we have delivered residential demand response equipment with an equivalent capacity of approximately 6,000 megawatts, which is enough to provide electricity for six million homes. In 2006, we supplied residential demand response equipment representing approximately 134 megawatts of the residential demand response equipment shipped in North America in 2006. Based on public request for proposals, we believe we supplied over 50% of the residential demand response equipment shipped in North America in 2006. We believe we are the only provider of demand response programs across all classes of energy consumers: residential, commercial and industrial. Our seven capacity contracts with electric utilities, which exclude The Connecticut Light and Power Company contract, represent a total of approximately 529 megawatts of contracted capacity. Through our Enerwise offerings that enable commercial and industrial energy consumers to participate in capacity programs with grid operators, we currently manage approximately 486 megawatts of additional capacity.
First-Mover Advantage in Pay-for-Performance Programs.    We are the first company to provide residential VPC programs to electric utilities. We believe that we are the only provider of outsourced demand response programs across all consumer classes, including residential, commercial and industrial. Currently, we operate six VPC programs with electric utilities. For two of our earliest residential VPC contracts, in PacifiCorp’s Utah service territory and the San Diego Gas and Electric service territory, we have residential consumer participation of 28% and 13%, respectively. With our commercial consumers, we have attained 11% participation in all VPC programs as of December 31, 2006. We also manage approximately 486 megawatts of capacity through our Enerwise offerings that enable commercial and industrial energy consumers to participate in capacity programs with grid operators. We are aware of only one other significant provider of outsourced programs focused on large commercial and industrial consumers. Our first-mover advantage has proved beneficial as we leverage our experience with our broad demand response base across all classes of energy consumers, including commercial, industrial and residential. We believe that we are one of only a few companies that has been successful implementing and simultaneously operating multiple programs. As a result, we have gained significant operational expertise in program implementation, measurement and verification, and customer service, which has provided us a distinct competitive advantage.

Portfolio Approach to Addressing the Market.    Through our three business units, we are uniquely positioned to provide demand response and energy efficiency solutions to all classes of energy consumers. We are able to do this through outsourced offerings whereby we manage and operate these programs, or through the sale of advanced tools, enabling utilities and commercial and industrial consumers to deploy and manage these programs internally. This also allows our utility customers to choose whether they would like to acquire the asset as part of their capital expenditure programs, or whether they provide us payment solely on the basis of the services we supply. When we maintain ownership of the asset upon the completion of the initial contract terms, we are then able to re-use the asset in other contracts with no additional capital or installation cost. An emerging business model is based on the customer’s ability to sell its capacity into an open market program established by the Independent System Operator (ISO). We have demonstrated success in providing tools and management services to our customers, allowing them to access these market opportunities by selling their excess capacity.
Ability to Address the Large and Growing Clean Energy Sector.    Our products and services increase available electric capacity through reduced energy consumption, are broadly deployed and provide an immediate solution to electric utilities on a cost-effective and environmentally friendly basis. We have a broad portfolio of solutions, based on state-of-the-art technology, that enables us to address the needs of all segments of the growing clean energy sector. Based on an UtiliPoint International report, over 50% of U.S. utilities and 71% of Canadian utilities are planning to expand their demand response initiatives. Accordingly, we believe that a large market opportunity remains within North America in which to expand our products and services. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant portion of the large and growing clean energy sector. We estimate that our total addressable market in the clean energy sector is approximately $7.4 billion annually.
Long-Term Contracts Provide Significant Recurring Revenues.    We have a variety of long-term contracts in both our Alternative Energy Resources Group and Smart Grid Solutions Group, including contracts for equipment sales, services and capacity programs. These contracts range from three to 20 years and provide us a stable and growing source of recurring revenues. Revenues derived from long-term contracts have become a larger portion of our business, growing from 30% in 2004 to 65% in 2006. These contracts have usual and customary provisions that allow us or our utility customers to terminate them for cause, and some contracts allow our utility customers to terminate them for convenience; however, no customers have terminated their contracts to date.
Large and Established Customer Base.    Since inception, we have developed relationships with over 70 Fortune 500 companies. We have also developed a customer base of over 500 electric utilities and energy service companies, including Austin Energy, The Connecticut Light and Power Company, Consolidated Edison, Duke Energy Corporation, Gulf Power Company, Inc., PacifiCorp, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and San Diego Gas & Electric Company. Our proven technology and long-standing relationships with our customers allow us to identify customer needs and provide new products and services. Additionally, through our Enerwise acquisition, we have developed strong relationships with commercial and industrial customers such as GlaxoSmithKline, Wyeth, Dupont and the University of Maryland.
Strong Strategic Alliances Create Multiple Channels to the Market.    We have strategic supply agreements and product development and marketing alliances with several industry-leading companies, including Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Cellnet Technology, Inc., Current Communications Group, LLC, Itron, Inc., Landis+Gyr, Inc. Sensus Marketing Systems, Inc., and the White-Rodgers division of Emerson Electric Co. Through these relationships, we combine our products and services with the offerings of these companies. As a result, we are able to increase our sales and expand our distribution channels within the clean energy sector.
Synergies Created Among our Operating Groups.    We are a vertically integrated clean energy solutions provider for all classes of energy consumers. We develop, manufacture and sell our products directly to electric utilities or alternatively, deploy them for the benefit of electric utilities and system operators on an outsourced basis through our demand response programs. Our Alternative Energy Resources Group is able to take advantage of the industry and technical expertise and customer relationships developed by our Smart Grid Solutions Group.

Pursue Targeted Strategic Opportunities.    We intend to pursue acquisitions and strategic relationships to strengthen our competitive position in the clean energy sector. This sector is comprised of a number of companies with niche offerings or customer relationships, which provide attractive acquisition opportunities. Other opportunities may include acquisitions of alternative energy companies that could benefit from our development expertise in outsourced programs.
Products and Services
With our acquisition of Enerwise in July 2007, we operate in three business units: our Alternative Energy Resources Group, our Enerwise Group and our Smart Grid Solutions Group. Through these three business units, we provide products and services to all sectors of the clean energy market and across all classes of energy consumers: residential, commercial, and industrial. In September 2007, we acquired PES, which became part of our Alternative Energy Resources Group. In connection with our continued acquisition of capacity and operations across all classes of energy consumers, we evaluate the megawatts of capacity that we provide to the electric utility industry according to business unit and manner by which the megawatts are provided, as summarized in the chart below.

We provide these megawatts of capacity to the electric utility industry in a variety of manners. Historically, we sold equipment, software and systems that electric utilities used to build our own demand response programs. We refer to the megawatts provided by these products and services, offered by our Smart Grid Solutions Group, as megawatts provided through equipment sales. In addition, we have been working with a variety of customers on programs where we directly develop, operate and manage the entire demand response program for our customers. These programs, operated by our Alternative Energy Resources Group, provide us with long-term, fixed, revenue streams based on the capacity, or megawatts provided by our programs. They also offer us the distinct advantage of owning and operating the underlying assets used in these programs. We refer to the megawatts provided under our VPC programs and megawatts provided under our base load capacity programs as megawatts owned under long-term capacity contracts (i.e. greater than three years in length). In addition, we have been managing megawatts provided by commercial and industrial consumers in capacity market programs with grid operators. In these programs, we aggregate megawatts from consumer loads, provide them to the market and operate them based on the specific parameters of the market and load suppliers. The contracts underlying these capacity market programs range in length from one to three years, reflecting the different grid operator markets. These programs are managed by our Enerwise Group, and we refer to the megawatts they provide as megawatts provided for sale in capacity market programs.
Alternative Energy Resources Group
Our Alternative Energy Resources Group offers solutions that address both peak and base load demands. Peak load demand, defined as the maximum capacity of electricity required over a specified time, is dynamic in nature and places the greatest stress on the grid system due to both the elevated levels and fluctuating duration of
 
91

demand. In this operating environment, our core VPC technology and management program (described below) is utilized to alleviate system stress by providing additional, timely capacity to electric utilities. Base load is defined as the amount of electricity required to meet average minimum demands. In this operating environment, we offer energy efficiency solutions utilizing a comprehensive project approach that provide permanent base load reduction. Our team develops and implements solutions incorporating energy efficiency sector expertise in categories including, among others, lighting, mechanical design, building automation, power quality, energy consulting services and energy information retrieval and analysis.
Given the complex and unique nature of these load environments, our offerings described below have proven to provide reliable solutions.
Load Control Programs
Our load control programs are targeted for utilities that not only need to purchase capacity, but also want to own the underlying assets. Utilities can contract with us for load control program design, build-out and operational services. These arrangements allow the utility to retain ownership of the underlying assets while enhancing operational performance and decreasing the need for the utility to pursue other solutions that would require large upfront capital investment.
Base Load Capacity Program
The structure of our base load capacity program is a pay-for-performance model whereby we provide permanent load reduction through equipment upgrades, energy auditing and consulting, building automation, lighting retrofits and other measures the reduce customers’ total energy consumption. Our existing energy efficiency contracts were acquired as part of our PES acquisition. We enter into long-term contracts to provide the reduced capacity, maintain and operate the improvements and ensure their utilization.
Virtual Peaking Capacity (VPC) Program
Our VPC offerings compete in the peak capacity markets that are predominately focused on the residential sector and provide a solution to alleviate stress on the electric grid by aggregating and coordinating the demands of load consuming equipment. The structure of our VPC programs is a pay-for-performance basis whereby we provide additional capacity through long-term contracts. Pay-for-performance means that we enter into long-term contracts with utilities and are paid under each contract based on the amount of verifiable kilowatts of capacity that we provide. In addition, we provide the same products and services offered pursuant to our VPC program, except on some occasions, we do not own the capacity, but deliver it on a pay-for-performance basis. Under our VPC programs, we own and operate the entire load management system. Through the VPC program, the Alternative Energy Resources Group mainly provides complete multi-year energy outsourced solutions, which generate recurring revenues. This is accomplished by bundling several products and services to provide utilities with a single solution offering.
Traditionally, utilities developed and built their own load management systems by separately managing all of the inherent component products and services. Our VPC programs provide our utility customers with the ability to outsource their load management needs on a pay-for-performance basis. To provide the required peak load reduction, we work with our utility customers to recruit, compensate, retain and service residential, small and large commercial, and industrial electricity consumers. We incur all costs associated with recruiting participants in our VPC programs, and we recognize such costs when incurred as a selling expense. We use a multi-channel approach to recruiting that includes direct mail and web enrollments, bill and free-standing inserts, newspaper, radio and billboard advertising and face-to-face marketing to commercial and industrial participants. Participants are compensated to enroll in a VPC program and are retained through various monetary and environmental incentives. These incentives include minimal cash payments for participation in the program or the issuance of tradable “green” certificates, both of which acknowledge the role the participant is playing in the
 
92
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

environment and energy conservation. These incentives can be paid either by us or our utility customers. If we pay the incentives, the costs are included in our cost of sales. We service our participants via our call center or via a third-party call center. Our call center is scalable and can ramp up or down based on seasonal needs or the launch of a new program. Our call center has trained representatives who handle questions from prospective and existing participants about all aspects of the load control program, including enrollment questions, program details, installation scheduling and post-installation servicing.
The participants who elect to participate in our VPC programs agree to allow us to install our products in their homes in order to decrease energy usage of certain appliances, such as their central air conditioner, electric water heater, irrigation pump or pool pump, during short periods of peak energy demand. These devices are controlled remotely by using our digital control units or SuperStats, coupled with a communication system and our load management system software. We, in return, receive payment for this capacity from the utility under our existing contract with the utility.
Ultimately, the utility is provided with the ability to directly implement, through a website for example, its desired demand reduction at times of its choosing, within the overall contractual constraints (typically, a maximum of 100 hours per year and no more than four hours per day, excluding weekends and holidays), and we provide all of the back-office support for installation, operation and maintenance of our VPC programs for reliability.
Our VPC programs are illustrated in the schematic on the next page. The schematic depicts the deployment of a VPC program. As illustrated, traditional generation sources (1) provide electricity to commercial and industrial (2) and residential (3) energy consumers. Through the VPC program, equipment (developed and supplied by the Smart Grid Solutions Group) is installed on large energy consuming devices such as air compressors, large process pumps and industrial processes. Control of the equipment is accomplished by sending signals to the control equipment using cellular (4) and paging (5) networks. In some cases, the cellular network is utilized for data collection and measurement and verification. The communication networks are operated from software systems (located at (6)) and redundant data center facilities (6). Using the Internet and the applications operating at the data centers, our internal staff and strategic vendors provide professional services (7) to fulfill contractual requirements, ensure reliability and meet the operational requirements required of our customers.

As a representative example of the operation of a VPC program, please refer to the graphic below. This graphic illustrates the effect of the VPC program on reducing and shifting the overall load in southwest Connecticut compared to the estimated load as forecasted by the Southwestern Connecticut Power Pool. The estimates are derived from temperature, humidity and other weather models, customer usage on previous days and other historical data used for the purposes of forecasting the energy demand and planning the delivery of energy. In addition, this graphic illustrates the locational marginal price for energy during the day. The locational marginal price is an accurate valuation of the price of energy at the location on the grid from which it is being consumed. The locational marginal price is calculated based on the cost to produce and deliver energy to that point on the grid and accounts for fuel and congestion costs. The data illustrated below demonstrates distinct reduction of electricity demand versus forecast during a period when the locational marginal price was over $1,000 per megawatt hour. During this event, our VPC was operated at its full capacity of 60 megawatts for over three hours.
LOGO
We operate our VPC programs through long-term, fixed price contracts with our utility customers, which make periodic payments to us based on estimates of the amount of electric capacity that we expect to make available to them during the contract year. We refer to these payments as proxy payments and electric capacity on which proxy payments are made as estimated capacity. The estimated load reduction is mutually negotiated with the utility and is based on our past experience in differing geographical locations utilizing various cycling strategies. During contract negotiations or in the first contract year of a VPC program, estimated capacity is negotiated and established by the contract. During each succeeding contract year, estimated capacity is the available capacity from the previous year. A contract year begins at the end of a utility’s seasonal peak energy demand for electricity. We refer to this seasonal peak energy demand as the cooling season. For example, the cooling season for one of our VPC contracts runs from June 1 to August 31, and the contract year for this agreement begins on September 1 and ends on August 31. During our fourth calendar quarter, we and our utility customers analyze results of measurement and verification tests that are performed during the cooling season of each contract year to statistically determine the capacity that was available to the utility during the cooling season. Measurement and verification tests are necessary because our hardware installed at participant locations to control energy usage of selected appliances are one-way devices that are programmed to receive and respond

to a wireless signal initiated by our software and transmitted over a public or private network but does not send a confirmation. Therefore, there is no verification that any certain device received a signal or properly executed its command. Because thousands of devices are subject to control in typical VPC programs, it is not economical to verify that each device is functioning properly. For this reason, a methodology has been developed that verifies the reduction of energy usage, measured in kilowatts, for a statistical sample of devices with an accepted utility confidence level generally of 90% or greater. This methodology is widely accepted in the industry. We refer to the results of this measurement and verification process as our available capacity.
Available capacity varies with the electricity demand of high-use energy equipment, such as central air conditioning compressors, at the time the measurement and verification tests are conducted, which, in turn, depends on factors beyond our control, such as temperature and humidity and the time of day and the day of the week the measurement and verification tests are performed. The correct operation of, and timely communication with, devices used to control equipment are also important factors that affect available capacity. Any difference between our available capacity and the estimated capacity on which proxy payments were previously made will result in either a refund payment from us to our utility customer or an additional payment to us by our customer. We refer to this process that results in a final settlement as a true-up.
For example, if, for any contract year, the contract capacity price is $80 per kilowatt year and the estimated capacity is 100,000 kilowatts, the electric utility customer would make periodic proxy payments to us of $8 million in the aggregate. If following the measurement and verification test, the available capacity was determined to be 105,000 kilowatts, or 5,000 kilowatts greater than the estimated capacity, an additional true-up payment of $0.4 million would be owed to us by the utility. On the other hand, if the available capacity was determined to be 95,000 kilowatts, we would owe the utility a true-up refund of $0.4 million. In addition, the estimated capacity for the next contract year would be set at a factor of either 1.05 or 0.95, as the case may be. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue Recognition” for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies relating to our VPC contracts.
Our VPC programs can be offered to utilities, either through the development of a new system (known as a greenfield), the acquisition and enhancement of an existing demand response system previously operated by the utility (a brownfield) or a combination of both. In addition to the 461 megawatts of contracted capacity under our greenfield systems with PacifiCorp, San Diego Gas & Electric Company, Public Service Company of New Mexico, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Nevada Power Company and Southern California Edison, our Alternative Energy Resources Group also operates an estimated 21 megawatt brownfield system in Nevada and owns a 60 megawatt brownfield VPC system in Houston, Texas, for a total capacity of 542 megawatts. We acquired the VPC system in Houston from Reliant Energy in 2002 and operated it until 2004 by marketing it to private energy marketers trying to penetrate the Texas retail electricity market. After deregulation, it was expected that 40% of electricity consumers would switch from investor-owned utilities to private energy providers, but by 2004, only about 5% had switched. As a result, we were not able to sign up enough participants to operate the program profitably and thus, suspended the program in 2004. The infrastructure, capable of delivering about 60 megawatts of capacity, remains in place, and we are waiting for development of a market structure that would justify restarting the program.
Separate from our VPC program, utilities can contract with us for load control program design, build-out and operation services, while retaining ownership of the underlying assets. Our load control programs are targeted for utilities not only needing to purchase capacity but also wanting to own the underlying load management system.

Enerwise Group
Our Enerwise Group provides energy-related services to large commercial and industrial consumers by enabling them to reduce energy and costs, improve reliability and maximize efficiency. Through the Enerwise Group’s products and services, energy consumers are able to gain an understanding of energy usage and the ability to utilize that information to develop and implement effective demand response programs and scalable enterprise energy management strategies. The Enerwise Group works with commercial and industrial consumers and their utilities to evaluate energy use within the commercial or industrial facility to develop a targeted implementation of energy-related strategies that are technically-feasible and cost-effective. The energy-related services provided by the Enerwise Group comprise its two principal offerings: energy management and energy and capacity services.
The energy management services provided by the Enerwise Group include the assessment of market opportunities in deregulated and unregulated markets and the performance of energy auditing and implementation strategies. The Enerwise Group offers demand response services for its clients and has the experience to provide commercial and industrial customers with an avenue to participate in the demand response programs offered in their area. In demand capacity markets, grid operators and utilities seek bids from their commercial and industrial consumer base to provide demand response capacity based on prices offered in competitive bidding. These opportunities are generally characterized by energy and capacity obligations with shorter contract periods and prices that may vary by hour, by day, by month or by bidding period. Several major grid operators, including PJM Interconnection, New York Independent System Operator and New England Power Pool, have active demand capacity markets in which our commercial and industrial customers participate through our demand response solutions. For example, the Enerwise Group works with commercial and industrial clients by first identifying available demand response capacity and then registering and facilitating the sale of that capacity in the open market on behalf of those clients. In these transactions, we receive revenue from grid operators and make payments to commercial and industrial consumers for both contracting to reduce electricity usage and actually doing so when called upon. Moreover, the Enerwise Group will implement and operate these systems on behalf of its clients. The demand response services offered include curtailment service provider registration, program registration and enrollment, event notification, automated dispatch and control during events, verification of load curtailment, pricing analysis, and ongoing energy consultation with energy analysts.
The energy and capacity services of the Enerwise Group relate to the upgrade and maintenance of power systems. These offerings include the implementation of SCADA-based control systems, power system distribution analysis, testing, maintenance, replacement or repair, engineering design and consulting, meter and sub-meter operations, maintenance and installation and data management and analysis.
The Enerwise Group supports these offerings with a staff of engineers, energy analysts and a software platform that operates from a 24x7 operations center called the Incident Command Center (ICC). The ICC is used as the central communications point for all operations, data collection systems and the coordination of operations with customers. The software platform offered by the Enerwise Group provides the ability to apply state of the art information and metering technology to collect and analyze energy information. The Enerwise software platform provides the following features:

Smart Grid Solutions Group
Our Smart Grid Solutions Group offers a broad range of products from basic one-way load control switches to technologically sophisticated smart thermostats and comprehensive two-way data collection and control systems, as illustrated in the chart below. The typical sale by our Smart Grid Solutions Group involves both hardware and software. We provide the hardware that is installed at a utility consumer’s location on high-energy consumption equipment, such as central air conditioning. Our software applications send wireless messages to manage and control our hardware. Upon receiving the messages, our hardware, in turn, reduces the length of time the equipment operates, thereby making electric capacity available to the utility. Our advanced metering products consist of our hardware that is installed at a utility’s residential or business customer’s electric meter. These devices collect information from the meter and transmit it through a software application where it is then stored on servers. This information is used by the utility to manage electricity consumption, analyze usage trends and generate billing information.
LOGO
The sales arrangement is usually either an upfront or multi-year sale of hardware and the grant of a software license, coupled with a software maintenance and support agreement. The maintenance and support agreement typically provides annual recurring maintenance and support fees of 20% of the software price. We have entered into various contracts with Smart Grid customers, and we expect payments from these contracts of approximately $47 million through 2016.
The products offered by our Smart Grid Solutions Group address the entire range of the Smart Grid market because our products include one- and two-way devices and virtually every communications mode, including wireless internet, VHF paging, telephone, broadband cable and cellular. We believe that we have provided approximately 50% of the current operational base of residential demand response equipment in the U.S. We

We have dedicated test engineers who design all product test systems, write custom software for product tests and monitor product quality and yields. Quality data is collected electronically and utilized by our design engineers for continuous product improvement and by the contract manufacturer for improvement of key manufacturing processes. Quality control tests are performed on a statistically significant portion of all outgoing orders to ensure compliance to specifications and corrective action techniques are employed to permanently resolve issues.
Our supply chain team in Atlanta has over 50 years of combined experience in manufacturing and quality processes, with training from industry leaders such as Scientific Atlanta, Inc. and Motorola, Inc. This experience has allowed us to manufacture products of very high quality levels and meet or exceed customer delivery expectations.

In addition, some traditional providers of advanced meter reading products, such as Itron, Inc. and ESCO Technologies, Inc. (through its DCSI Division), may add demand response products and services to their existing business. We also compete against traditional supply-side resources such as natural gas-fired peaking plants as well as independent power producers. Electric utilities could also offer their own demand response solutions, which would decrease our base of potential customers and could decrease our revenues and profitability.
Our Smart Grid Solutions Group has a competitive advantage by being able to offer a full range of products in the Smart Grid market because they include one- and two-way devices and virtually every communications mode. In addition, we are the first and only company to provide residential VPC programs to electric utilities and we currently offer programs across all classes of energy consumers: commercial, industrial and residential. This has been accomplished by leveraging our experience with our broad demand response customer base. As a result, we have gained significant operational expertise in technology program implementation, measurement and verification, and customer service, which has provided us a distinct competitive advantage.
However, some advanced metering initiative service providers are substantially larger and better capitalized than us and have the ability to combine advanced meter reading and demand response products into an integrated offering to a large existing customer base. In addition, the target market for our VPC programs has been composed largely of “early adopters,” or customers who have sought out new technologies and services. Larger competitors could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competing business model that may be more attractive to potential customers than what we offer. In addition, because of the other services that our competitors provide, they may choose to offer clean energy services as part of a bundle that includes other products, such as residential advanced meter reading and automated invoicing, which we do not offer.
History and Development of the Business
The origin of our business began at divisions of Scientific Atlanta, Inc. and Lucent Technologies Inc. in 1974 and 1991, respectively. In 1992, Acorn Factor created its Powercom Division to develop advanced meter reading, electric utility data management and analysis and load management solutions. Comverge, Inc. was organized in 1997 as a Delaware corporation by Acorn Factor, and we evolved to our present state of operations through the acquisitions of the Utility Solutions Division of Lucent Technologies Inc. in 1997 and the organization of Comverge Control Systems, Ltd. in 1998 as our wholly owned subsidiary to receive the assets of Powercom, followed by the acquisition of the Controls System Division of Scientific Atlanta, Inc. in 1999. In 2002, we made the strategic decision to develop, own and operate load management systems on an outsourced basis for the benefit of our utility customers. We named this offering Virtual Peaking Capacity and created our Alternative Energy Resources Group in 2005 to expand our VPC programs throughout North America. In 2003, we acquired the intellectual property, operating assets and customers of Sixth Dimension, Inc. In 2007, we organized Alternative Energy Resources, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary and assigned to it all of our VPC contracts previously entered into by us. It now conducts the operations of our Alternative Energy Resources Group. Comverge Control Systems, Ltd. and Alternative Energy Resources, Inc. were our only two active operating subsidiaries as of June 30, 2007. In July 2007, we acquired Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc. and established the Enerwise Group. In September 2007, we acquired the four operating entities comprising the business of Public Energy Solutions, some of which were formerly a part of the business of PSEG Energy Technologies, the unregulated portion of PSEG Holdings LLC in New Jersey, and added their offerings as part of the Alternative Energy Resources Group.
Payments from Long-Term Contracts
Payments from long-term contracts represent our estimate of total payments that we expect to receive under long-term agreements with thirteen of our utility customers in our Smart Grid Solutions Group and our Alternative Energy Resources Group. As of November 30, 2007, we estimated that our total payments to be received through 2017 were approximately $289 million. Of this amount, we expect payments of $242 million from our Alternative Energy Resources Group’s contracts, which includes approximately $3 million from a

marketing contract, and $47 million from our Smart Grid Solutions Group’s contracts. These estimated payments do not include any estimated payments from our VPC contract with The Connecticut Light and Power Company, which was denied regulatory approval as initially submitted. While we are working with The Connecticut Light and Power Company to amend and resubmit the contract to the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control for approval, we have excluded any estimated payments from this contract in light of the initial denial.
These estimates of payments from long-term contracts are forward-looking statements based on the contractual terms and conditions. In management’s view, such information was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments and to management’s knowledge and belief, presents the assumptions and considerations on which we base our belief that we can receive such payments. However, this information should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this prospectus should not place undue reliance on this information. Any differences among these assumptions, other factors and our actual experiences may result in actual payments in future periods significantly differing from management’s current estimates of payments allowed under the long-term contracts and our actual experiences may result in actual payments collected being significantly lower than current estimates. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not receive the payments anticipated by our long-term contracts and recognize revenues from our backlog, and comparisons of period-to-period estimates are not necessarily meaningful, may not be indicative of actual payments and should not be relied upon.” The information in this section is designed to summarize the financial terms of our long-term contracts and is not intended to provide guidance on our future operating results, including revenues or profitability.
Our estimated payments from long-term contracts have been prepared by management based on the following assumptions:
VPC Contracts:
 
 	•	 	
Our existing VPC contracts as of November 30, 2007 represented contracted capacity of 482 megawatts, an increase of 262 megawatts compared to contracted capacity of 220 megawatts as of December 31, 2006. As of September 30, 2007, we had built out 227 megawatts of capacity, compared to 175 megawatts of capacity as of December 31, 2006. In calculating the estimated $198 million of payments from our VPC contracts as of November 30, 2007, we have assumed that we will complete the build out of our remaining 309 megawatts by the end of 2010, reaching the full 482 megawatts of potential available capacity under our VPC load management systems. Our expectations regarding the build out under our VPC contracts are based on our experience to date in building out the load management systems.

 
 	•	 	
As of September 30, 2007, we had VPC contracts with 492 megawatts of contracted capacity, of which we had built out 227 megawatts of this capacity. In calculating the estimated $172 million of payments from these VPC contracts as of September 30, 2007, we have assumed that we will complete the build out of our remaining 265 megawatts by the end of 2010.

 
 	•	 	
On October 1, 2007, the two VPC contracts with ISO New England Inc. terminated pursuant to their terms, which represented 71 megawatts of installed capacity.

 
 	•	 	
Our VPC contract entered into during October 2007 with Southern California Edison represents contracted capacity of 50 megawatts. In calculating the estimated $25.5 million of payments from this VPC contract, we have assumed that we will receive the required regulatory approvals of the program from the California Public Utilities Commission and complete the build out of the entire 50 megawatts by the end of 2010.

 
 	•	 	
We have assumed that once our build-out phase is complete we will operate our VPC contracts at their maximum contractual capacity for the remainder of the term. For example, if one of our VPC contracts provides for 90 megawatts of contracted capacity, we have assumed that upon full build-out we will provide our utility customer with 90 megawatts of available capacity for the remainder of the contract term.

 
 	•	 	
The amount our utility customers pay to us at the end of each contract year may vary based upon the results of measurement and verification tests performed each contract year based on the electric capacity

that we made available to the utility during the contract year. See “—Revenue Recognition” for further explanation of the measurement and verification procedures and our associated revenue recognition policies. For purposes of calculating our payments from long-term contracts, we have assumed that the capacity we will provide our utility customer is the maximum contractual capacity under the applicable contract and that payments resulting from the measurement and verification tests will remain constant based on our current measurement and verification performance. We have and will continue to utilize our experience through measurement and verification testing and our VPC programs to more accurately derive our estimated capacity, which in turn will allow for more detailed marketing and more competitive pricing for our VPC pay-for-performance programs.
 
 	•	 	
The amount of available capacity we are able to provide, and therefore the amount of payments we receive, is dependent upon the number of participants in our VPC programs. For purposes of estimating our payments under long-term contracts, we have assumed that the rate of replacement of participant terminations under our VPC contracts will remain consistent with our historical average.

 
 	•	 	
Payments from long-term contracts include $11.4 million that we expect to recognize as revenues over the course of the next 12 months, which are included in backlog. Payments from long-term contracts exclude $13.2 million of payments already received but have been deferred that we expect to recognize as revenue over the course of the next 12 months, which are included in backlog.

Base Load Capacity Contracts:
 
 	•	 	
Our existing energy efficiency contracts as of November 30, 2007 were acquired as part of our Public Energy Solutions acquisition and represent base load contracted capacity of 47 megawatts. In calculating the estimated $40.7 million in payments from these contracts, we have assumed we will complete the build-out of the entire 47 megawatts by the end of 2010. We have assumed that once our build-out is complete, the permanent base load reduction will remain installed providing the maximum contractual capacity for the remainder of the contract term. Our expectations regarding the build-out under our energy efficiency contracts is based on the experience to date Public Energy Solutions has in building out base load reduction systems since 2005.

Smart Grid Solutions Group Contracts:
 
 	•	 	
$35.6 million in payments expected to be received over the next eight years under a contract with Gulf Power Company to provide products and services. This is based on estimated contractual minimum order volumes and current payments attributable to installation and other services applied over the term of the contract.

 
 	•	 	
An estimated $11.8 million in purchase orders pursuant to multi-year contracts that we expect will be renewed through 2011 based on amounts and timing of historical purchases.

In addition to the foregoing assumptions, our estimated payments from long-term contracts assume that we will be able to meet on a timely basis all of our obligations under these contracts and that our customers will not terminate the contracts for convenience or other reasons. We have not included payments our Enerwise Group will receive from selling capacity in power pool programs because such pacts are not long-term contractual arrangements. Our annual net loss in 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $9.3 million, $8.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively. We may continue to generate annual net losses in the future, including through the term of our long-term contracts. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We have incurred annual net losses since our inception, and we may continue to incur annual net losses in the future.”
Although we currently intend to release quarterly updates of future revisions that we may make to our estimated payments from long-term contracts, we do not undertake any obligation to release the results of any future revisions that we may make to these estimated payments from long-term contracts to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this prospectus.

Backlog
Our backlog represents our estimate of revenues from firm commitments, including purchase orders and long-term contracts, that we expect to recognize over the course of the next 12 months. A comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenues. As of September 30, 2007, we had backlog of $46.2 million, with approximately 63%, or $29.3 million, expected to be fulfilled by December 31, 2007. As of September 30, 2006, we had backlog of $29.0 million.
Employees
As of September 30, 2007, we had approximately 272 employees, which includes 48 employees in our Enerwise Group and 65 employees from our acquisition of Public Energy Solutions. Our employees include approximately 20 technical staff who conduct research and development. Our employees are not represented by any labor unions, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
In order to provide benefits to our employees in a cost-effective manner, we have entered into a client services agreement with Administaff Companies, II, L.P., pursuant to which Administaff provides us with certain personnel management services with respect to most employees, such as payroll, medical and dental insurance and the administration and access to a 401(k) plan. Under the agreement, we and Administaff are intended to be co-employers of all of our employees. Co-employment is necessary for Administaff to administer payroll and to sponsor and maintain benefit plans. Prior to their acquisition by Comverge, the Enerwise Group and Public Energy Solutions each entered into a client services agreement with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. to provide similar services as provided to us under the Administaff agreement. Currently , the employees of the Enerwise Group and Public Energy Solutions remain subject to the ADP agreement and are not covered by the Administaff agreement.
Properties
In East Hanover, New Jersey, we lease approximately 14,250 square feet of space for our headquarters and our Alternative Energy Resources Group. Our Alternative Energy Resources Group also leases 7,800 square feet of leased office and warehouse space in Englewood, New Jersey. In Atlanta, Georgia, we lease approximately 15,600 square feet of leased space for our Smart Grid Solutions Group. In Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, we lease approximately 19,737 square feet of leased space for our Enerwise Group. In Newark, California, we lease approximately 2,400 square feet of leased space for software development and southwest U.S. operations. In Pensacola, Florida, we occupy space provided by Gulf Power Company, Inc. for supporting our installation services and our VPC contract with Gulf Power. In Tel Aviv, Israel, we lease space provided by a subsidiary of our former parent, Acorn Factor, for our Israeli software and systems design center, for which we are allocated costs. In Las Vegas, Nevada and Albuquerque, New Mexico, we have leased space to conduct operations under our Nevada Power VPC contract and our Public Service Company of New Mexico VPC contract, respectively. The above facilities are in good condition, and we believe that our properties will be sufficient to support our operations for the foreseeable future. We do not own any properties.
Legal Proceedings
In the ordinary conduct of our business, we are subject to periodic lawsuits, investigations and claims. Although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of lawsuits, investigations and claims asserted against us, we do not believe that any currently pending legal proceeding or proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is subject will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

As required under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Market, on which our common stock is listed, a majority of the members of our board of directors qualify as “independent,” as affirmatively determined by the board of directors. In addition, we impose additional tests of independence with respect to members of our audit committee that are consistent with the Nasdaq Global Market listing standards and with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Our board of directors consults with our outside legal counsel to ensure that the board of directors’ determinations are consistent with listing standards, SEC rules and relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the definition of “independent.” Consistent with these considerations, and after reviewing all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his family members, and us, our senior management and our independent auditors, our board of directors has affirmatively determined that all of our directors are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq Global Market listing standards, except for Mr. Chiste, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. Our independent directors will meet at least twice annually in executive sessions without the presence of any corporate officers.
Following our initial public offering, two members of our Class I directors resigned from our board of directors. Mr. Alexander Ellis III resigned on July 17, 2007 and Mr. Timothy A. Woodward resigned on August 21, 2007. Neither resigned as the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter related to the Company’s operations, strategies, policies or practices. Our board of directors has no immediate plans to appoint replacements for Messrs. Ellis and Woodward.
Our board of directors is divided into three classes. The members of each class serve staggered, three-year terms. Upon the expiration of the term of a class of directors, directors in that class will be elected for three-year terms at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which their term expires. The classes are currently composed as follows:
 
 	•	 	
Scott B. Ungerer is a Class I director and there are two vacant Class I director seats, whose terms will expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders in 2008;

 
 	•	 	
William J. Grealis, John A. Moore and R. Blake Young are each a Class II director, whose terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2009; and

 	•	 	
Nora Mead Brownell, Robert M. Chiste and Robert F. McCullough are each a Class III director, whose terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2010.

Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of our directors. This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors has three permanent committees: audit committee, nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee. Our board of directors has affirmatively determined that all of the directors who serve on these committees are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq Global Market listing standards, SEC rules and relevant securities and other laws and regulations.
Audit Committee.    Our audit committee is currently composed of Messrs. Grealis, McCullough and Moore. Mr. McCullough serves as the chairman of the audit committee. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. McCullough qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under the current SEC regulations, and the other members of our audit committee satisfy the financial literacy and other requirements for audit committee members under the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq Global Market. The audit committee assists the board in overseeing: (1) our accounting and financial reporting processes; (2) the audits of our financial statements; (3) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (4) the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors; and (5) the performance of our internal audit function and our independent auditors. The audit committee charter further provides that the audit committee, among other things:
 
 	•	 	
has sole authority to appoint, compensate, retain, evaluate and terminate our independent auditors;

 
 	•	 	
has sole authority to review and approve in advance all audit and permissible non-audit engagement fees, scope and terms with our independent registered public accounting firm;

 
 	•	 	
review and approve all related party transactions between us and any executive officer or director;

 
 	•	 	
will monitor the compliance of our officers, directors and employees with our code of business conduct and ethics; and

 
 	•	 	
will establish and maintain procedures for (1) the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters and (2) the confidential, anonymous submission by our employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.

The written charter for the audit committee is available on our website.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.    Our nominating and corporate governance committee is composed of Messrs. Grealis, McCullough and Young. Mr. Grealis serves as the chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee. The principal duties of the nominating and corporate governance committee are as follows:
 
 	•	 	
to recommend to the board of directors proposed nominees for election to the board of directors by the stockholders at annual meetings, including an annual review as to the renominations of incumbents and proposed nominees for election by the board of directors to fill vacancies that occur between stockholder meetings; and

 
 	•	 	
to make recommendations to the board of directors regarding corporate governance matters and practices.

The written charter for the nominating and corporate governance committee is available on our website.

Compensation Committee.    Our compensation committee is composed of Messrs. Ungerer, Young and Moore and Ms. Brownell. Mr. Young serves as the chairman of the compensation committee. Pursuant to its charter, the compensation committee has the following responsibilities, among others:
 
 	•	 	
to review and establish, at least annually, with the input of management, corporate goals, objectives, policies and philosophies for all compensation paid to our chief executive officer and other officers, for the defined performance period;

 
 	•	 	
to determine and approve all compensation paid to the chief executive officer and other officers, including base salary, bonuses, incentive plans and perquisites;

 
 	•	 	
to establish the targets for performance-based compensation of the chief executive officer and other officers for the defined performance period and confirm whether such targets have been met for the completed performance period;

 
 	•	 	
to report to our board of directors on the performance of the chief executive officers and other officers in light of the corporate goals, objectives, policies and philosophies established with respect to compensation for the performance period; and

 
 	•	 	
to review and recommend to our board of directors compensation of non-employee directors, including committee chairpersons and members.

The written charter for the compensation committee is available on our website.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of our executive officers serve as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee.
Director Compensation
In 2006, directors who also served as employees received no compensation for serving on our board of directors, and directors affiliated with significant stockholders received no cash compensation for serving as a director. Non-employee directors not affiliated with a significant stockholder received $1,000 per board meeting attended. In accordance with this policy, Mr. Chiste did not receive any compensation for serving as a director due to his status as an employee, and Messrs. Ellis, Moore, Ungerer and Woodward did not receive any compensation for attending meetings of our board of directors during 2006 due to their affiliations with significant stockholders. Ms. Brownell was appointed as a director in December 2006, attended no board meetings in 2006 and received no cash compensation in 2006. Our directors did not receive an annual cash retainer in 2006.
In addition to board meeting fees, Mr. McCullough, as chairman of the audit committee, received $2,000 for each meeting of the audit committee he attended and $2,000 for his time in preparing for each audit committee meeting. No other director received a cash fee for attending a committee meeting. We reimbursed all of our directors for all reasonable expenses incurred for attending meetings of our board of directors and committees.
We have historically made an initial grant of 12,500 stock options to directors upon joining our board of directors and an annual grant of 3,750 stock options to each director who is not our employee. Messrs. Ellis, Grealis, McCullough, Moore, Ungerer, Woodward and Young each received 3,750 stock options for their service as directors on our board of directors during 2006, and Messrs. Grealis, McCullough and Young each received a new director initial grant of 12,500 stock options when they joined our board during 2006. As recognition for his service as chairman of the audit committee, we made a one-time grant of 7,500 stock options to Mr. McCullough. In December 2006, Ms. Brownell joined our board of directors and received a grant of 7,737 stock options and

3,868 shares of restricted stock, which is consistent with our new board of directors compensation policy discussed below regarding grants to be made to newly appointed board members. Our directors received no perquisites during 2006 in their capacity as directors. Mr. Chiste received certain perquisites in his capacity as our chief executive officer, as described below.

In anticipation of our becoming a public company, our compensation committee revised its director compensation program in October 2006 for all non-employee directors effective January 1, 2007. The revised director compensation program no longer distinguishes between directors who have affiliations with significant stockholders and those who do not. The revised program consists of the following elements:
 
 	•	 	
for each non-employee director, a $20,000 annual cash retainer paid in quarterly installments;

 
 	•	 	
for each non-employee director who serves as the chairman of a standing committee of our board of directors, an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000 will be paid in quarterly installments;

 
 	•	 	
for each non-employee director who serves as a member of a standing committee of our board of directors, a cash fee of $1,500 per committee meeting attended will be paid;

 
 	•	 	
for each non-employee director, annual equity grants will be awarded with an estimated aggregate value of $60,000, where 50% of such value is in the form of restricted common stock and 50% in options to purchase common stock. The equity grants will be awarded on the date of our annual stockholders’ meeting, except for a director whose term is expiring and is not standing for re-election. The restricted stock will be valued at, and the option exercise price will be, the closing market price of our common

stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on that date. The number of shares of restricted common stock to be granted will be determined by dividing $30,000 by the closing market price, and the number of options to purchase common stock will be determined by dividing $30,000 by 50% of the closing market price. For example, if the closing market price is $20 per share on the date of grant, then the director would receive 1,500 shares of restricted stock ($30,000 divided by $20) and stock options to acquire 3,000 shares ($30,000 divided by $10, which represents 50% of the $20 per share restricted stock value) at a $20 exercise price. Both the restricted stock and the stock options will vest one fourth each quarter over one year; and
 
 	•	 	
for each new director appointed or elected to our board of directors, a one-time equity grant of restricted common stock and options to purchase our common stock will be awarded with an estimated aggregate value of $80,000, with the number of shares determined on the same basis as the annual equity grant. This one-time equity grant will be made on the date of the new director’s election or appointment to our board of directors. The restricted stock will be valued at, and the option exercise price will be, the closing market price of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market on that date. Both the restricted stock and the stock options will vest one sixteenth each quarter over a period of four years.

The compensation committee will from time to time review the compensation program for directors, consistent with its obligations under the compensation committee charter.
Executive Officer Compensation
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for 2006 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. Actual compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from currently planned programs as summarized in this discussion.
Introduction
Since April 2003 through 2006, we were privately owned and controlled by three venture capital firms and Acorn Factor, Inc., our former parent. Together, these four firms beneficially owned approximately 64% of our issued and outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2006, and for much of 2006, including the period in which the 2006 compensation elements for our executive officers were determined, they controlled four of five seats on our board of directors. Several other venture capital firms and two strategic investors not represented on our board of directors, but holding contractual rights to observe and participate in board meetings, held approximately 28% of our issued and outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2006.
The typical venture capital investment strategy is to make a significant investment in a small private company and then oversee and nurture the investment for a period of three to five years. The overriding objective is to increase both the enterprise value and size of the company during this period and to assist the company in achieving a liquidity event for its then-existing stockholders, generally through an initial public offering of its capital stock or the sale of the company to an unrelated entity. Since 2003, this business strategy has been employed by the venture capital firms that own, in the aggregate, over 93% of our capital stock. Our compensation strategy during this period, as it relates to named executive officers, has been designed to support and complement the successful execution of this strategy.
Our named executive officers for 2006 were Robert M. Chiste, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President; Michael D. Picchi, our Chief Financial Officer; Frank A. Magnotti, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Alternative Energy Resources Group; Edward J. Myszka, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Smart Grid Solutions Group; and T. Wayne Wren, our Executive Vice President and General

Counsel. Mr. Picchi was promoted to Chief Financial Officer in June 2006, prior to which time Mr. Wren served as our Chief Financial Officer.
Corporate Governance
Compensation Committee Authority
Executive officer compensation is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors, which is composed of three members. Mr. R. Blake Young became the compensation committee chairman upon his joining our board of directors in August 2006. Mr. Scott B. Ungerer has served on our compensation committee since 2003 and Mr. Timothy A. Woodward, prior to his resignation in 2007, served on our compensation committee since 2003. Messrs. Ungerer and Woodward approved the 2006 compensation arrangements described in this compensation discussion and analysis. Our board of directors appoints the compensation committee members and delegates to the compensation committee the direct responsibility for, among other matters:
 
 	•	 	
approving, in advance, the compensation and employment arrangements for our executive officers;

 
 	•	 	
reviewing all of the compensation and benefit-based plans and programs in which our executive officers participate; and

 
 	•	 	
reviewing and recommending changes to all our equity-based plans to our board of directors as appropriate, subject to stockholder approval as required.

Our board of directors has determined that each committee member is independent under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Market, the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and the relevant securities laws, and that each member is an “outside director” as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The compensation committee met seven times in 2006.
Role of Compensation Experts
Pursuant to its charter, the compensation committee is authorized to obtain at company expense compensation surveys, reports on the design and implementation of compensation programs for directors, officers and employees, and other data and documentation as the compensation committee considers appropriate. In addition, the compensation committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate any outside counsel or other experts or consultants engaged to assist it in the evaluation of compensation of our directors and executive officers, including the sole authority to approve such consultants’ fees and other retention terms. The compensation committee did not retain the services of a compensation consultant to design, review or evaluate our executive compensation arrangements for 2006 or prior thereto, nor did it acquire or consult any compensation surveys or reports. Instead, for 2006, the compensation committee considered the following factors, among other matters, in determining compensation levels for executive officers:
 
 	•	 	
the qualifications, skills and experience level of the respective executive officer;

 
 	•	 	
the position, role and responsibility of the respective executive officer in the company; and

 
 	•	 	
the general business and particular compensation experience and knowledge of the compensation committee’s members gained through more than 20 years of combined experience working in and with privately held companies in similar industries as our officers.

The compensation committee has engaged a consultant with respect to 2007 compensation arrangements, as described below under “—2007 Transitional Compensation Framework.”

Role of Our Executive Officers in the Compensation Process
Mr. Chiste was actively involved in providing recommendations to the compensation committee in its evaluation and design of 2006 compensation programs for our executive officers, including the recommendation of individual compensation levels for executive officers other than himself. Mr. Chiste relied on his personal experience serving in the capacity of chief executive officer or executive officer of several public companies as well as publicly available information for comparable compensation guidance. He also consulted information provided by our third-party personnel management service provider and by an executive search firm specializing in recruiting executive officers for our company and other similar firms. Mr. Chiste did not provide this specific information with the compensation committee, but rather used it as the basis for his own recommendations to the committee. Mr. Chiste attended all of the compensation committee’s meetings and served as secretary of several meetings for the purpose of keeping minutes. However, Mr. Chiste was not present during compensation committee deliberations and voting pertaining to the determination of his own compensation. No other named executive officer assumed an active role in the evaluation, design or administration of 2006 executive officer compensation programs.
Executive Officer Compensation Strategy and Philosophy
Our executive officer compensation strategy has been designed to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers and to align their interests with those of investors by linking significant components of executive officer compensation with the achievement of specific business and strategic objectives and our overall financial performance. We seek to employ executive officers who are entrepreneurially driven, and accordingly, we offer a compensation package that places a significant amount of it at risk by providing a substantial part of compensation in the form of equity incentives. The conservation of cash resources for use in growing our business has been an objective in designing our compensation arrangements.
It has been our view that the total compensation for executive officers should consist of the following components:
 
 	•	 	
base salaries;

 
 	•	 	
annual cash incentive awards;

 
 	•	 	
long-term equity incentive compensation; and

 
 	•	 	
certain perquisites and other benefits.

We consider long-term equity incentive compensation to be the most important element of our compensation program for executive officers. Since April 2003, our stockholders have expected our executive management team not only to significantly increase the enterprise value of our company but also to significantly expand our business within three to five years to allow for a liquidity event to be considered. We believe that meaningful equity participation by each executive officer is the primary motivating factor that will result in significant increases in value and growth. This belief is reflected in the aggregate awards of stock options and restricted stock that have been made to our executive officers.
It has been our philosophy that optimal alignment between stockholders and named executive officers is best achieved by providing a greater amount of total compensation in the form of equity rather than cash based salary. Accordingly, we have designed total compensation programs for our executive officers to provide base compensation levels, annual cash incentive award opportunities and long-term incentive compensation awards that are economically equivalent to typical programs available for comparable executive officers in similarly situated venture capital-backed private companies. Although we did not retain a compensation consultant for 2006, the compensation committee, based on its collective experience, believes that the cash components of our executive officer compensation are less than those that may be offered by similar companies that are not principally financed with venture capital and that the long-term equity component of our executive officer

compensation is greater than similar companies. The compensation committee determined compensation levels that it concluded were appropriate based on the general business and particular compensation experience and knowledge of its members gained from working with venture capital-backed private companies and with public companies.
Our 2006 incentive compensation program elements were primarily structured to reward our executive officers for achieving certain financial and business objectives, including the following:
 
 	•	 	
significantly increasing stockholder value through the continued implementation of current VPC programs and the placement of new VPC programs;

 
 	•	 	
achieving certain corporate and divisional revenue, EBITDA, gross margin and cash retention targets;

 
 	•	 	
ensuring that we are fully prepared for a capital markets transaction; and

 
 	•	 	
securing a debt facility to finance our investment in future VPC programs.

We believe that the attainment of these specific financial objectives assist in the fulfillment of our strategic objectives:
 
 	•	 	
to increase our enterprise value;

 
 	•	 	
to grow our company in an efficient manner; and

 
 	•	 	
to conserve and optimally utilize cash resources for the future growth of our business.

Components of Compensation
Base Salaries
The base salaries of our named executive officers are reviewed on an annual basis as well as at the time of a promotion or other material change in responsibilities. Adjustments in base salary are based on an evaluation of individual performance, our company-wide performance and the individual executive’s contribution to our performance. In large part because of the emphasis on equity compensation, no named executive officer received a performance-based increase in his base salary from 2005 to 2006. Mr. Picchi joined us in February 2006 and received a $15,000 increase in his annual base salary in June 2006 upon being promoted from Chief Accounting Officer to Chief Financial Officer.
Annual Cash Incentive Awards
Our named executive officers participated in two annual cash incentive award programs in 2006: each executive officer’s individual 2006 Bonus Plan and our 2006 VPC Bonus Pool available for certain of our managers, senior managers, executive officers and other key employees. The following table summarizes, for each named executive officer, the target cash incentive awards and the amounts actually earned by each executive officer under his 2006 Bonus Plan and the 2006 VPC Bonus Pool.

Chiste, Picchi and Wren, respectively, above the amounts shown in the table.

2006 Bonus Plan
The purpose of each executive officer’s 2006 Bonus Plan was to create financial incentives that were aligned with the overriding objective of increasing stockholder value. The 2006 Bonus Plan awards were earned based on the achievement of defined financial targets and specific non-financial objectives established for each of our named executive officers.
In June 2006, financial targets were established for each executive officer. These targets included the achievement of specified threshold levels of revenue, EBITDA, gross profit percentages and year-end cash balances for our 2006 fiscal year. These financial targets and the associated performance levels that were established represented the factors that the compensation committee deemed most important and which, if achieved, would likely result in an increase in stockholder value. The specific performance levels were determined with reference to our 2006 budget, which we used to manage our day-to-day business and was determined by our board of directors as representing an aggressive level of growth and financial performance for us in 2006.
Mr. Chiste’s financial targets were based on our financial performance company-wide with a revenue target of $38.42 million, EBITDA target of $3.0 million and a year-end cash balance of $3.5 million. The financial targets for Messrs. Picchi and Wren consisted of the same targets as Mr. Chiste plus a target gross profit percentage of 53.5%. The financial goals established for Messrs. Magnotti and Myszka were based on the performance of the business groups that they lead. For Mr. Magnotti, the financial targets were based on the Alternative Energy Resources Group’s revenue target of $16.52 million, EBITDA target of $3.3 million and a gross profit percentage target of 73.7%. For Mr. Myszka, the financial targets were based on the Smart Grid Solutions Group’s revenue target of $24.1 million, EBITDA target of $79,000, a gross profit percentage target of 36.4% and a year-end cash balance of $3.5 million. In addition to these group-specific financial targets, Messrs. Magnotti and Myszka could have received 0%, 15%, 50% or 100% of $14,000 and $10,000, respectively, depending on the attainment of one, two, three or four of the company-wide financial targets set forth above for Messrs. Picchi and Wren for revenue, EBITDA, gross profit percentage and year-end cash balance.
For compensation purposes, all financial targets were expressed on a pro forma basis adjusted from our GAAP financial results by assuming that all VPC revenues, deferred for GAAP purposes, were recognized in the year in which they were paid or accrued without reference to whether such revenues were deemed fixed and determinable under current GAAP accounting rules. The compensation committee determined that these pro forma results were a better reflection of the executive officers’ performance. For a discussion of our GAAP revenue recognition policies, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition.”
Non-financial objectives were established as a result of discussions between our compensation committee and Mr. Chiste, in the case of Mr. Chiste’s objectives, and between Mr. Chiste and other named executive officers, in the cases of their objectives. Non-financial objectives required demonstrable enhancement in specific portions of a named executive officer’s area of authority and were specifically structured for each named executive officer. The non-financial objectives for each named executive officer for 2006 were as follows:

Targeted cash incentive awards for each named executive officer were adjusted by reference to a matrix based on the achievement of a specified number of financial targets and non-financial objectives. For example, as illustrated in the matrix below, if Mr. Chiste achieved one non-financial objective and two financial targets were met, he would have received 30% of his targeted 2006 Bonus Plan cash incentive. Although the number and details of non-financial objectives were specifically structured for each named executive officer due to their differing abilities of satisfying the objectives that had been established, all financial targets and non-financial objectives needed to be achieved to receive 100% of the targeted cash incentives under the executive officer’s 2006 Bonus Plan. See “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2006” for the threshold, target and maximum amounts that could have been received by each named executive officer under his 2006 Bonus Plan.

In accordance with the 2006 Bonus Plans for Messrs. Chiste, Picchi and Wren, following the consummation of our initial public offering, each of these three executive officers was paid pursuant to a multiplier, where Mr. Chiste received a 200% multiplier, and Messrs. Picchi and Wren received a 150% multiplier. This additional modification was designed to reward the additional work required by those named executive officers who were most directly involved with preparing us for an initial public offering. The price ranges applicable to the modification were based on possible ranges of our stock price, and the 20-day average was selected due to our belief that this is a sufficient period to gauge the success of the offering. Each of the named executive officers subject to this modification was eligible to receive a reduction to 90% or an increase to 150% of their otherwise earned 2006 Bonus Plan amounts. If the average price of our shares during this period, as adjusted for stock-splits, was $10.00 to 11.99, $12.00 to 13.99, $14.00 to 15.99, $16.00 to 17.99 or $18.00 or above, the participating executive officers would have received 90%, 100%, 110%, 125% or 150%, respectively, of their bonus amount otherwise earned for the year. Due to his integral role in the offering process and overall responsibility for influencing all aspects of our business, Mr. Chiste was eligible to receive an additional 25% of his total bonus for the year if the average trading price of our shares is $20.00 and an additional 25% for each dollar of average trading price in excess of that amount. In addition, pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Chiste received a one-time bonus of $250,000 in connection with the successful completion of our initial public offering.

Mr. Magnotti’s 2006 Bonus Plan also provided that he was to receive a cash incentive equal to 0.1% of the value of each Smart Grid Solutions Group sale of $5 million or more to a single customer booked in 2006, provided that Mr. Magnotti played a key role in securing that sale and that shipment was scheduled to occur prior to December 31, 2007. This additional bonus was designed to provide Mr. Magnotti, who heads our Alternative Energy Resources Group, with an incentive for working directly with customers of our Smart Grid Solutions Group in securing business. Collaboration between the Alternative Energy Resources Group and the Smart Grid Solutions Group is key to the long-term success of our business.
Amounts Earned Under 2006 Bonus Plan
The amounts earned by each of our named executive officers under the 2006 Bonus Plan was determined in February 2007 by the compensation committee after examining our financial results and evaluating the performance by each executive officer of his individual plan goals. For 2006, the compensation committee determined that we achieved one company-wide financial goal: the year-end cash balance target. In addition, the compensation committee determined that Mr. Magnotti achieved the Alternative Energy Resources Group’s financial goals for revenue and EBITDA and that Mr. Myszka achieved the Smart Grid Solutions Group’s financial goal for gross profit percentage. Messrs. Chiste, Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren achieved three, four, six, six and three non-financial goals, respectively.
Based on the achievement of these financial and non-financial goals, the compensation committee determined that the amounts earned by each of our named executive officers during fiscal year 2006 under the 2006 Bonus Plan were $96,390, $2,160, $16,200, $12,400 and $3,285 for Messrs. Chiste, Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren, respectively.
2006 VPC Bonus Pool
The VPC Bonus Pool was designed to encourage the short-term and long-term success of the Alternative Energy Resources Group by promoting teamwork across all departments and functional areas of responsibility. The VPC Bonus Pool was determined by measuring two metrics important to the growth of our VPC business: the increase in cumulative installed capacity and the increase in contractual capacity. In December 2005, the compensation committee set the target 2006 VPC Bonus Pool at $462,000, which was determined based on our estimated levels of VPC implementation. During 2006, we allocated funds to the 2006 VPC Bonus Pool when we completed any of the following events:
 
 	•	 	
installation of each net residential control device;

 
 	•	 	
installation of each net multi-family unit;

 
 	•	 	
installation of each small commercial kilowatt;

 
 	•	 	
installation of each large commercial kilowatt;

 
 	•	 	
signing of each megawatt of greenfield VPC; and

 
 	•	 	
signing of each megawatt of brownfield VPC.

Certain managers, senior managers, executive officers and other key employees participated in the 2006 VPC Bonus Pool, with named executive officers being allocated 37% of the total pool. For 2006, Mr. Chiste was allocated 2% of the pool, Messrs. Picchi and Wren were each allocated 3% of the pool, Mr. Myszka was allocated 4% of the pool and Mr. Magnotti, who is the named executive officer primarily responsible for the success of our Alternative Energy Resources Group, including our VPC program, was allocated 25% of the pool. The amounts earned by each of our named executive officers under the 2006 VPC Bonus Pool were paid in August 2006 and February 2007. The initial payout to participants of accrued amounts under the 2006 VPC Bonus Pool was made following the receipt of June 30, 2006 financial information and resulted in payments to our named executive officers of $1,468, $2,203, $18,358, $2,937 and $2,203 for Messrs. Chiste, Picchi,

Magnotti, Myszka and Wren, respectively. The final payout under the 2006 VPC Bonus Pool was made following the receipt of December 31, 2006 financial information and resulted in payments to our named executive officers of $825, $1,238, $10,319, $1,640 and $1,238 for Messrs. Chiste, Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren, respectively.
Employment Agreement Signing Bonus
Each of Messrs. Picchi, Myszka and Wren received a one-time signing bonus of $7,500 upon execution of their employment agreements, which were entered into effective as of December 31, 2006. These payments were determined to be appropriate by the compensation committee as compensation for these officers waiving certain vesting acceleration rights they had with respect to existing stock options.
Initial Public Offering Bonus
Due to their efforts during 2006 in preparing for the initial public offering of our common stock, the compensation committee awarded Mr. Chiste a cash bonus of $15,000 and each of Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren a cash bonus of $10,000. These bonuses were approved in early 2007 and were designed to reward each of our named executive officers for their efforts in preparing the company for an initial public offering while continuing to grow our business.
Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Overview
We currently administer long-term incentive compensation awards through our 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted in August 2006. This plan amended and restated our 2000 Stock Option Plan under which equity incentive grants were made prior to August 2006. The purpose of the plan is to promote the interests of the company and our stockholders by encouraging our employees, non-employee directors and other service providers to acquire or increase their equity interest in the company, thereby encouraging them to work toward our continued growth and success. The plan permits awards of stock options, restricted stock, performance based stock and options and other forms of equity compensation.
Historically, we have awarded non-qualified stock options as the primary form of equity compensation. We selected this form because of the favorable accounting and tax treatment and the expectation by key employees in our industry that they would receive stock options. We have also selectively made use of restricted stock grants. We have generally considered and made equity awards in three circumstances:
 
 	•	 	
upon hiring new executive officers;

 
 	•	 	
following significant equity financings after considering the impact of dilution on our executive officers; and

 
 	•	 	
to existing executive officers upon the hiring of a new executive officer after comparisons are made between executive officers with respect to proportionality and fairness across our management team.

Until the end of the 2005 fiscal year, we permitted executive officers to take stock options of equivalent value in lieu of portions of their cash incentive awards. We provided this choice because it favored our venture capital-based structure and our desire to favor equity awards over cash compensation. Other than those equity grants tied to the performance criteria established in our bonus plans, we have not had any program or systematic practice of making annual grants of equity incentive awards to named executive officers.
Stock option and restricted stock awards that we have granted have vested upon both performance-based and time-based measures. Performance-based awards are forfeitable if specified performance targets are not achieved within a specified period of time. Time-based awards vest in accordance with vesting schedules determined by our compensation committee.

2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards
In February 2006, the compensation committee awarded Mr. Picchi stock options to acquire 50,000 shares of our common stock in consideration of his joining us as our chief accounting officer.
In May 2006, the compensation committee awarded Mr. Chiste stock options to acquire 31,446 shares of our common stock in recognition of his contribution to closing the sale of our Series C preferred stock to a strategic investor and the coincident execution of a development agreement with such investor. The number of stock options was based on a formula developed in 2005 wherein it was agreed that Mr. Chiste would receive $100,000 in stock options based on the value of our common stock at the closing of our Series C preferred stock financing.
In June 2006, the compensation committee awarded Mr. Picchi stock options to acquire 25,000 shares of our common stock. This award was designed to reward Mr. Picchi for the service he would be providing to us in preparing for our initial public offering in his new position as our chief financial officer. The stock options vest one eighth each quarter over two years. The unexercised portion of this option will be forfeitable if we do not close an initial public offering of our capital stock before June 30, 2007.
In August 2006, the compensation committee awarded Messrs. Magnotti and Myszka stock options to acquire 15,000 shares of our common stock. The stock options were forfeitable if certain financial goals were not achieved for the year ended December 31, 2006. In order to receive the full grant, we were required to achieve annual revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $38.4 million. To receive one-half of the grant, we were required to achieve annual revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $37 million. The threshold amount was 2,500 options, which was tied to a $36 million revenue target. The compensation committee awarded these grants to provide an additional incentive for the heads of our Alternative Energy Resources Group and Smart Grid Solutions Group to meet our revenue targets for 2006. We only met the threshold revenue target of $36 million for 2006, which, accordingly, resulted in 12,500 of the potential 15,000 stock options being forfeited.
In October 2006, the compensation committee awarded Messrs. Chiste, Magnotti and Wren stock options to acquire 25,000, 10,000 and 5,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, vesting one sixteenth each quarter over four years, and with a term of seven years. These stock options were granted to replace previously granted stock options for the same number of shares that had been issued in 2003. The previous stock options had been forfeited because vesting requirements had not been met, but this forfeiture had not been effectively communicated and the stock options had continued to be shown by the company as outstanding. The compensation committee determined that an equitable resolution of this matter was to issue the same number of stock options, but at the higher, current fair market value exercise price and with new time-based vesting terms.
Stock Option Practices
We have awarded all stock options to purchase our common stock to executive officers at or above the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date. We have not back-dated any option awards. With the exception of the October 2006 awards, the fair market value of all options granted in 2006 was determined by a contemporaneous independent valuation of our common stock provided to us by Duff & Phelps LLC, a professional valuation firm that the compensation committee engaged for such purpose. We estimated the fair market value of the October 2006 awards based on the most recent appraisal by Duff & Phelps LLC, estimates of our equity value provided to us by the underwriters in our initial public offering, estimates of the probable public offering price range of our common stock and our own internal financial forecasts and expectations. Following our initial public offering, new employees have been awarded stock options at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the compensation committee following their hire dates, and the grants have an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the meeting.
When we were privately owned company, there was no market for our common stock. Accordingly, in 2006, we had no program, plan or practice pertaining to the timing of stock option grants to executive officers coinciding with the release of material non-public information.

Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits
In 2006, we had two corporate offices as well as several satellite offices and required frequent travel by our employees, including Mr. Chiste and Mr. Wren. In 2006, Mr. Chiste and Mr. Wren, who both reside in Texas, discharged a significant portion of their executive responsibilities in our New Jersey and Atlanta offices, respectively. Messrs. Chiste and Wren, other executive officers and a number of other employees travel frequently between our New Jersey and Atlanta offices and to our satellite offices. Accordingly, we deemed it appropriate and economically efficient to provide a single corporate apartment and company automobiles of New Jersey and Atlanta for the use of all employees, including Mr. Chiste and Mr. Wren, while they work at these locations. Because Messrs. Chiste and Wren principally reside in Texas, we determined for disclosure purposes that the amounts allocable to them for their air transportation to and from, and their proportional use of the apartment and automobile in New Jersey and Atlanta, respectively, should be viewed as perquisites. In addition, because of Mr. Chiste’s extensive travel schedule, we reimburse him for air transportation costs for his wife to fly occasionally between Texas and New Jersey. See the Summary Compensation Table below for the amounts attributable to Messrs. Chiste and Wren for these benefits provided in 2006.
Mr. Chiste is entitled to be reimbursed for the cost of an annual physical and for the preparation of his income taxes. Because we consider the physical condition of our named executive officers to be important to their performance, we reimbursed each of them $2,850 during 2006 to undergo an extensive physical examination. These amounts are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below.
We maintain an employee benefit plan that provides our employees with the opportunity to enroll in our health, dental and life insurance plans. Each of these benefit plans requires the employee to pay a portion of the premium, with the company picking up the remainder. These benefits are offered on the same basis to all employees. We also maintain a 401(k) retirement plan that is available to all full-time U.S. employees including named executive officers. We do not match elective employee-participant contributions.
Stock Ownership Requirements
We adopted guidelines for our directors and executive officers that take effect on January 1, 2008. These guidelines establish minimum ownership requirements of our common stock by our directors or executive officers or stock retention guidelines applicable to equity-based awards granted to directors and executive officers.
As of December 31, 2006, our named executive officers as a group held 125,000 shares of restricted common stock and stock options to acquire 1,129,822 shares of our common stock, which have been granted as compensation. In addition, Messrs. Chiste, Magnotti and Wren have purchased preferred stock in our private placement transactions on the same terms as other investors. If all stock options were exercised, all restrictions on common stock were removed and all preferred was converted, our named executive officers would have held approximately 13.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2006. See “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2006 Year-End” for outstanding options and restricted stock awards held by our named executive officers.
2007 Transitional Compensation Framework
We viewed 2006 as the year in which we would transition from being a private to a public company with a larger and more diverse stockholder base. Accordingly, in 2006, we began the process of establishing a more structured and measurable compensation framework for executive officers appropriate for a public company and responsive to the requirements and expectations of our anticipated expanding stockholder base.
In 2006, we undertook the following actions:
 
 	•	 	
appointed four independent directors with public company experience, one a qualified financial expert;

 
124
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	•	 	
revised and amended our compensation committee charter to make it compliant with all current rules and guidelines of the Nasdaq Global Market, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002;

 
 	•	 	
adopted a new 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan compliant with Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and FAS 123(R); and

 
 	•	 	
the compensation committee engaged a compensation consultant to assist it in evaluating and structuring executive officer compensation programs for 2007.

This section summarizes the significant steps we have taken to date with respect to establishing compensation elements for 2007.
Compensation Committee Evaluation of Executive Officer Compensation Policies to be Applied in 2007
In the fall of 2006, the compensation committee began an evaluation of the objectives, design, elements and process for establishing executive officer compensation with the intention of adopting changes for 2007 that would be appropriate for a company whose stockholder base is in transition from being privately-held (with over 90% of the ownership concentrated in fewer than ten stockholders) to possibly becoming a publicly-traded company. In connection with this evaluation, the compensation committee retained Pearl Meyer & Partners as its consultant to prepare an extensive executive officer compensation study that included an analysis of compensation levels at public companies in the same or similar industries and a review of our existing salary structure, annual incentive programs and long-term incentive plans. The consultant also worked with the compensation committee to provide guidance on recommendations with respect to possible policies and elements of compensation.
Although the compensation committee is still in the process of finalizing several decisions in order to implement new or modified policies for 2007, the following are material changes that it has already made or is determined to make:
 
 	•	 	
Base Salaries:

 
 	Ø	 	
establish 2007 base salaries at the market median, or the 50th percentile, of our peer group of public companies as determined by the compensation consultant we engaged; and

 
 	Ø	 	
established base salaries for Messrs. Chiste, Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren of $350,000, $190,000, $215,000, $215,000 and $200,000, respectively.

 
 	•	 	
Annual Cash Bonuses for 2007:

 
 	Ø	 	
establish 2007 annual cash bonus targets that are calculated as a percentage of the participant’s base salary, with performance metrics that provide for a range of payments beginning with no bonus below a threshold performance level and then a target level and a maximum level; and

 
 	Ø	 	
establish performance metrics for achieving an annual cash bonus similar to those established for 2006, based on revenues, EBITDA and year-end cash, which are directly linked our 2007 operating budget, and in the case of Mr. Magnotti, new kilowatts added under current or new VPC contracts that have achieved regulatory approval and a certain installed kilowatt by the end of 2007.

 
 	•	 	
Long-Term Incentive Compensation for 2007:

 
 	Ø	 	
establish 2007 long-term equity incentive compensation at a level so that the executive officer’s total compensation target would be at the 75th percentile of our peer group;

 
 	Ø	 	
establish the long-term equity incentive compensation award levels as having value that is based on a multiple of each executive officer’s base salary;

 
125
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	Ø	 	
establish performance metrics that provide for a range of equity grants beginning with no grant below a threshold performance level, a threshold grant, a target grant, and a maximum grant based on a multiple applied to the particular executive officer’s base salary;

 
 	Ø	 	
after the achievement of 2007 performance metrics is determined in the first quarter of 2008, grants will be made at the fair market value;

 
 	Ø	 	
establish that once the dollar value of the long-term equity incentive compensation to be granted is determined pursuant to the performance metrics, 75% of the resulting equity grants would be in the form of stock options and 25% of the value in the form of restricted stock, with options having a seven year term and vesting one sixteenth each quarter over four years after the date of grant and restricted stock subject to 100% vesting three years after the date of grant; the compensation committee will annually revisit whether the future restricted stock vesting should be time-based or performance-based and linked to the achievement of yet to be determined metrics;

 
 	Ø	 	
establish that in determining the number of shares of restricted stock and stock underlying options to be awarded in 2007, the restricted stock would be valued at the fair market value and the options would be valued at 50% of the value of the restricted stock. For example, if an executive officer were to receive $400,000 under this program and the market price was $20 per share on the date of grant, then the executive officer would receive the following: $100,000 of restricted stock (following the 25% policy) or 5,000 shares (which is $100,000 divided by $20), and $300,000 of options (the corresponding 75%) to acquire 30,000 shares (which is $300,000 divided by $10, which represents 50% of the $20 per share restricted stock value) at a $20 exercise price; and

 
 	Ø	 	
consider the number of shares that should be granted to executive officers and other employees as a percentage of our outstanding equity and determine that a 5% burn rate was both appropriate and within the range of its peers and would serve as an annual maximum with no obligation to award the entire pool annually.

Application of 2007 Policies to the Restricted Stock and Option Grants Made in Connection with Our Initial Public Offering
After reviewing the long-term equity compensation previously granted to executive officers and considering the benefits to us from both a retention and incentive perspective, the compensation committee granted restricted stock and stock options to executive officers valued at the initial public offering price for their efforts in connection with our initial public offering. The compensation committee determined to award these grants based on a dollar value that is equal to the multiple for each executive officer’s base salary at the “target” level that has been set for 2007 rather than either the lower “threshold” multiple or the higher “maximum” multiple. Both the expectation of making grants and the condition has been communicated to our executive officers.
The terms of these grants are set forth below under “—Restricted Stock and Stock Option Grants Made in Connection with the Initial Public Offering,” and these terms and the calculation of the number of shares are both consistent with the descriptions above under the heading “—Compensation Committee Evaluation of Executive Officer Compensation Policies to be Applied in 2007.”
Tax Implications of Executive Compensation
Our aggregate deductions for each named executive officer compensation are potentially limited by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent the aggregate amount paid to an executive officer exceeds $1.0 million, unless it is paid under a predetermined objective performance plan meeting certain requirements, or satisfies one of various other exceptions specified in the Internal Revenue Code. At our named executive officer compensation levels, we did not believe that Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code would be applicable, and accordingly, our compensation committee did not consider its impact in determining compensation levels for our named executive officers in 2006.

Accounting Implications of Executive Compensation
Effective January 1, 2006, we were required to recognize compensation expense of all stock-based awards pursuant to the principles set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(R), Share-based Payment. Consequently, we began recording noncash stock compensation expense in our financial statements for stock options granted during fiscal 2006 and thereafter. In our financial statements, we utilize the prospective method to calculate noncash compensation expense. However, in the Summary Compensation Table below and the Director Compensation Table above, we used the modified prospective method as required by the SEC’s regulations. The noncash stock compensation expense for stock options that we grant is generally recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period. We continue to believe that stock options, restricted stock and other forms of equity compensation are an essential component of our compensation strategy, and we intend to continue to offer these awards in the future.

(1)	 	All options granted have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of the option on the date of grant. With one exception, all options awarded had exercise prices equal to the valuation of our stock performed by Duff & Phelps LLC, its predecessor firms or other independent valuation firms. The one exception to this pricing method occurred in October 2006 when we granted options to Messrs. Chiste, Magnotti and Wren with an exercise price of $8.00 per share. The exercise price for these options was determined by our compensation committee based on an approximation of the current fair market value of our shares in relation to our prior grant of options and the anticipated price of our common stock in our initial public offering.

(2)	 	Reflects amounts earned by each named executive officer under our non-equity incentive plans for 2006. As of February 2007, we paid $2,293, $3,441, $28,677, $4,577 and $3,441 to Messrs. Chiste, Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren, respectively, under our VPC Bonus Pool. In addition, we paid $96,390, $2,160, $16,200, $12,400 and $3,285 to Messrs. Chiste, Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren under the executive officer’s respective 2006 Bonus Plan. The amounts shown for Messrs. Chiste, Picchi and Wren reflect the lowest amount that each executive officer was entitled to receive following the adjustment of the bonus based on the initial public offering of our shares. Based on the consummation of our initial public offering on April 18, 2007 and the average closing price for our common stock for the 20 trading days following our IPO, the amounts earned by Messrs. Chiste, Picchi and Wren pursuant to the 2006 Bonus Plan were $214,200, $2,550 and $5,475, respectively. These amounts represent an increase of $117,810, $390 and $2,190 for Messrs. Chiste, Picchi and Wren, respectively, above the amounts shown in the table. See “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Components of Compensation—2006 Bonus Plan.” See descriptions of these plans above under “Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Components of Compensation—Annual Cash Incentive Awards.”

(5)	 	Mr. Picchi joined us as our principal accounting officer in February 2006 and was promoted to chief financial officer in June 2006. This amount represents a combination of his pro-rated annual salary of $160,000 until June and a salary of $175,000 following his promotion. Mr. Wren served as chief financial officer prior to Mr. Picchi.
(6)	 	Reflects perquisites that we paid for air transportation, apartment use and the use of a company-owned vehicle by Mr. Wren for his travel to and from our corporate office in Georgia and his residence in Texas.

(1)	 	Reflects the date on which the compensation committee was deemed to take action and officially granted stock options that were provided for under prior agreements or arrangements.
(2)	 	Reflects the minimum compensation payable for the attainment of the minimum performance criteria under the executive officer’s 2006 Bonus Plan and our 2006 VPC Bonus Pool.
(3)	 	Reflects the compensation payable if the target performance criteria established for the executive officer were met under the executive officer’s 2006 Bonus Plan and our 2006 VPC Bonus Pool.
(4)	 	Reflects the maximum compensation payable if all of the performance criteria established for the applicable executive officer were met under the executive officer’s 2006 Bonus Plan and our 2006 VPC Bonus Pool. Includes the maximum compensation payable under the executive officer’s 2006 Bonus Plan if our common stock retains the average maximum anticipated price following our initial public offering over a period of 20 days. Although Mr. Chiste may receive a higher amount if our initial public offering price exceeds certain levels, the maximum listed for him in the table assumes his receipt of the same percentage increase as other named executive offices. The 2006 Bonus Plans for Messrs. Magnotti and Myszka do not provide for the receipt of additional incentive payments based on the performance of our common stock following our initial public offering.
(5)	 	These grants were made by the compensation committee on December 8, 2005 and reflect stock options awarded based on a conversion of the executive officer’s 2005 cash bonus into stock options. The number of stock options and the exercise price was determined on January 26, 2006 when a valuation of our capital stock performed by Duff & Phelps LLC was formally recognized by our compensation committee.
(6)	 	These grants were made on May 23, 2006 and reflect stock options awarded to Mr. Chiste based on his completion of our Series C preferred stock financing. The incentive for Mr. Chiste’s completion of the Series C financing was set in December of 2005 at $100,000 of stock options based on the market price of our common stock on the date the financing was completed. The applicable exercise price for the determination of the number of option shares was recognized in May, and the option was dated for February to reflect the date of completion of the financing.
(7)	 	On August 23, 2006, our compensation committee awarded equity based incentives to Messrs. Magnotti and Myszka of 15,000 stock options each. These stock options could have been earned only if designated revenue targets were met. The schedule for these awards provided that 2,500 , 5,000 and 7,500 stock options would be earned on a cumulative basis upon our attaining revenue targets of $36 million, $37 million and $38.42 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. After reviewing our revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the compensation committee determined that a revenue target of $36 million had been met, and accordingly, 2,500 stock options were earned.

Employment Agreements
Mr. Chiste
We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Chiste on September 1, 2001. The original term expired on December 31, 2002 and has been automatically extended from year to year in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The agreement can be terminated on December 31 of each year by written notice from either party issued at least 30 days prior to that date. The compensation committee approved an increase in Mr. Chiste’s annual base salary to $350,000, effective January 1, 2007. The agreement also provides that Mr. Chiste will be eligible to receive a performance bonus not to exceed 75% of his annual base salary based on achieving reasonable performance objectives established by our board of directors. For fiscal 2007, however, the compensation committee has approved modifying the bonus amount that Mr. Chiste could earn, as discussed above under “Executive Officer Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2007 Transitional Compensation Framework—Compensation Committee Evaluation of Executive Officer Compensation Policies to be Applied in 2007.”
Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Chiste received a one-time bonus in the amount of $250,000 upon the successful completion of our initial public offering. The agreement further provides that we will reimburse Mr. Chiste up to $50,000 for the expenses that he incurs for relocating from his home in Houston, Texas, to a residence near our office in New Jersey. In addition, the agreement provides that Mr. Chiste is entitled to be reimbursed for an annual physical up to $500 and for the annual preparation of his income taxes.
During the term of the agreement and for a period of two years after its termination, Mr. Chiste is restricted from engaging in any business that is competitive with our business or soliciting our employees. Mr. Chiste is also required to assign certain intellectual property rights to us.
Pursuant to the employment agreement, we are obligated to make payments to Mr. Chiste following the termination of his employment. Upon retirement, Mr. Chiste is entitled to receive annual payments equal to 50% of his final base compensation for a period of four years and annual payments equal to 25% of his final base compensation for an additional three years. In 2006, we recorded $407,879 in compensation expense related to the cumulative post-employment payments that may be made to Mr. Chiste. The total amount payable to Mr. Chiste calculated by reference to his base compensation as of January 1, 2007 would be $962,500. The total amount that we have accrued for the payment of this benefit is reflected under “Pension Benefits” below.
In the event that any severance benefits payable to Mr. Chiste would be deemed to constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then Mr. Chiste would also be entitled to reimbursement of the excise tax payable on such parachute payments, but the reimbursement will in no event exceed 15% of the amount of the parachute payment.
This agreement was amended on October 11, 2007, solely to include provisions related to alleviating potential tax burdens for Mr. Chiste under the recently enacted Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
Other Named Executive Officers
Effective as of December 31, 2006, we entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren that provide for their employment as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Alternative Energy Resources Group, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Smart Grid Solutions Group and Executive Vice President and General Counsel, respectively. These agreements have an initial term of two years and automatically renew for subsequent one-year terms unless we or the named executive officer provides written notice within 90 days prior to the completion of the then-current term. Mr. Wren has informed us that he intends to step down from his role as our General Counsel; however, the effective date of his transition has not been determined. It is currently contemplated that Mr. Wren will continue his service with us in a different capacity following this change, but

the nature of his ongoing role has not been determined and we cannot guarantee that we and Mr. Wren will come to mutually agreeable terms as to his continued service.
These agreements were amended on October 11, 2007, solely to include provisions related to alleviating potential tax burdens for officer under the recently enacted Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
Base Salaries
The employment agreements provide that Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren receive an annual base salary of $190,000, $215,000, $215,000 and $200,000, respectively. In addition, Messrs. Picchi, Myszka and Wren each received a one-time signing bonus of $7,500 in 2006 as compensation for waiving certain vesting acceleration rights they had with respect to existing stock options. The agreements provide that each such executive officer is entitled to participate in equity and non-equity incentive programs that we may establish from time to time.
Intellectual Property and Non-Compete Clauses
The employment agreements with each of Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren require that the executive officer promptly disclose and assign any individual rights that he may have in any intellectual property (including inventions, concepts, designs, business opportunities, formulas, etc.) to us. Under a non-compete provision, the executive officers are prohibited from engaging in certain conduct for the longer of the period for which he is entitled to severance payments and one year after the date of his termination. During this time, these executive officers are not permitted to solicit or sell products to any of our past or present customers, induce any customer to cease doing business with us, call on any of our employees with the intent of enticing them away from employment with us or enter into any business entity or venture that sells products or services that compete with, or are similar to, our products or services.
Severance and Change in Control Payments
Under the terms our employment agreements with Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren, we may be obligated to make severance payments following the termination of their employment. These benefits are described below under “Potential Post-Employment Payments and Payments on a Change in Control.”
In the event that any payments to which Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka or Wren become entitled would be deemed to constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments will be subject to reduction to the extent necessary to ensure that the executive officers receive only the greater benefit of receiving the amount of those payments which would constitute such a parachute payment or the amount which yields the executive officer the greatest after-tax amount of benefits after taking into account any excise tax imposed on the payments provided to the executive officer pursuant to the agreement (or on any other benefits to which the executive officer may be entitled in connection with a change in control or the subsequent termination of service) under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Mr. Chiste is entitled to post-employment retirement payments in the aggregate amount of $687,500 based on his annual base salary as of December 31, 2006 since he was employed with us after attaining his 60th birthday in June 2007. Based on his new salary of $350,000 effective as of January 1, 2007, Mr. Chiste would be entitled to a payment of $962,500.

(3)	 	Mr. Chiste is entitled to the reimbursement of all of his COBRA expenses if he is terminated without cause.
(4)	 	Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren are entitled to severance payments equal to nine months of their annual base salary if they are terminated without cause and 18 months of their annual base salary if they are terminated without cause within 12 months following a change in control.

(5)	 	Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren are entitled to severance payments equal to their prorated prior year bonus payments if they are terminated without cause prior to a change in control.

If they are terminated within 12 months after a change in control, they are entitled to a severance payment equal to 1.5 times their bonus received in the year prior to their termination. Severance payments were estimated based, in each case, on multiplying their respective targeted 2006 Bonus Plan amount times 1.5.

Severance Benefits
Mr. Chiste
Under Mr. Chiste’s employment agreement, we may be obligated to make severance payments to him upon termination of his employment if we terminate him other than for cause, including a termination by virtue of a notice not to extend the agreement. “Cause” is defined under Mr. Chiste’s employment agreement as a termination with the approval of at least two-thirds of our board of directors under circumstances including the following:
 
 	•	 	
breach by him of any material provision of his employment agreement;

 
 	•	 	
material breach by him of any of our written policies;

 
 	•	 	
his inability to perform his duties due to illness, physical or mental disability, or other incapacity which continues for an uninterrupted period of 60 consecutive days or one 120 in any twelve-month period;

 
 	•	 	
fraud by him with respect to our business or affairs;

 
 	•	 	
his conviction of a felony; or

 
 	•	 	
alcohol abuse or illegal drug use.

Upon termination, Mr. Chiste is entitled to receive the following severance benefits:
 
 	•	 	
any earned but unpaid base compensation through the termination date;

 
 	•	 	
a lump sum payment equal to three times his annual base salary;

 
 	•	 	
a limited “gross-up” for certain excise taxes payable by Mr. Chiste, as described above;

 
 	•	 	
reimbursement of business expenses incurred prior to termination;

 
 	•	 	
any benefits available to Mr. Chiste under any benefit plan or program in which Mr. Chiste is a participant; and

 
 	•	 	
reimbursement to Mr. Chiste of the cost of COBRA coverage for him and his family.

Any severance benefits payable to Mr. Chiste will be in addition to any retirement benefits to which he may become entitled.
Mr. Chiste’s employment agreement does not provide for the payment of severance benefits following a termination of employment by him for good reason.
Other Named Executive Officers
Under the employment agreements with each of Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren, we may be obligated to make severance payments following the termination of each executive officer’s employment if we terminate him without cause or he terminates his employment for good reason, subject to certain cure periods. “Cause” is defined under each employment agreement as:
 
 	•	 	
the executive officer’s breach of a material provision of the agreement;

 
 	•	 	
the executive officer’s material breach of any of our written policies or procedures;

 
 	•	 	
the executive officer’s material non-compliance with a lawful direction given by our chief executive officer;

 
 	•	 	
the executive officer’s inability to perform his duties for an uninterrupted period of 180 days;

 
 	•	 	
fraud by the executive officer with respect to our business affairs;

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	•	 	
the executive officer’s commission or plea of no contest to a felony or crime involving moral turpitude; or

 
 	•	 	
alcohol abuse or illegal drug use by the executive officer.

“Good reason” is defined under each employment agreement as:
 
 	•	 	
the reduction of the executive officer’s salary or other material component of compensation under the agreement without the executive officer’s prior written consent; or

 
 	•	 	
our relocation of the executive officer to a location more than 75 miles from the location specified in his agreement without the executive officer’s prior written consent.

If the employment of Messrs. Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka or Wren is terminated by us for cause or by the executive officer without good reason, we are not obligated to make any severance payments to the executive officer. The amount that an executive officer is entitled to receive upon a termination of his employment by us without cause or by the executive officer with good reason is based on the executive officer’s base salary at the time of termination and his incentive compensation. Under the severance provisions of each executive officer’s employment agreement, they are each entitled to severance pay in the amount of nine months of annual base salary plus an amount equal to the pro-rated amount of his non-equity incentive compensation for the prior year. In addition, the executive officers are entitled to the continuation of benefits under our standard employee benefit plan during the period that they are entitled to receive severance payments.

a merger or consolidation of us with any other corporation unless the voting securities of the company outstanding immediately prior to the transaction continue to represent (either by remaining outstanding or being converted into voting securities of another entity) more than 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the surviving or parent company; or

 
 	•	 	
the consummation of an agreement for the sale or disposition by us of all or substantially all of our assets, other than to an entity where at least 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities are owned by our stockholders in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of us immediately prior to such sale.

If a termination without cause or by the executive officer with good reason occurs within 12 months after the occurrence of a change in control, then the executive officer will be entitled to severance payments equal to 18 months of his base salary plus 150% of his prior year’s non-equity incentive award. In addition, each executive officer will immediately be vested in all unvested stock options upon a change in control.

Restricted Stock and Stock Option Grants Made in Connection with Our Initial Public Offering
In October 2006, our compensation committee determined that concurrent with our initial public offering, it would grant restricted stock and stock options to our named executives officers based on the same long-term incentive compensation policies that it has adopted for 2007. These grants to our executive officers were based on their successful performance during 2006, and the numbers of shares of restricted stock and shares underlying the stock options were determined based on the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share. For a description of how such grants were determined, see “Executive Officer Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2007 Transitional Compensation Framework—Compensation Committee Evaluation of Executive Officer Compensation Policies to Be Applied in 2007.”
Based on the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share, the number of shares of restricted stock and shares underlying stock options granted to named executive officers are set forth in the following table.

Chiste, Picchi, Magnotti, Myszka and Wren are $1,050,000, $237,500, $322,500, $322,500 and $200,000, respectively. For a discussion of assumptions made in the valuation, see “Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation” to our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included elsewhere in this prospectus.
The per share exercise price for the stock options is the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share, and the grant date was April 12, 2007. The stock options granted to named executive officers have a term of seven

years and vest in equal quarterly installments over a period of four years subject to their continued employment. The restricted stock vests on the third anniversary date of the date of grant subject to the named executive officers’ continued employment with us.
2006 Long-term Incentive Plan
The following contains a summary of the material terms of our Comverge, Inc. 2006 Long-term Incentive Plan, or 2006 plan, which has been adopted by our board of directors and will be approved by our stockholders prior to the consummation of this offering. The 2006 plan is an amendment and restatement of the Comverge, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan, or 2000 plan. Awards granted on or after the June 20, 2006 effective date of the 2006 plan are governed exclusively by the terms of the 2006 plan. Stock options granted prior to June 20, 2006 will also be governed by the 2006 plan unless the terms of the 2006 plan are inconsistent with the terms of the stock options granted under the 2000 plan and would result in a material modification of a grant under the 2000 plan. The following description of the terms of the 2006 plan is not complete. For more information, we refer you to the full text of the 2006 plan, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.
Purpose of the 2006 Plan.    The 2006 plan is intended to promote our interests and the interests of our stockholders by encouraging our employees, service providers and non-employee directors to acquire or increase their equity interests in our common stock, thereby giving them an added incentive to work toward our continued growth and success.
Term of the 2006 Plan.    The 2006 plan terminates upon, and no further awards will be made, after the tenth anniversary of the effective date.
Shares Subject to the 2006 Plan.    Except as provided below, the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2006 plan shall not exceed 4,156,037. Other 2006 plan limitations include:
 
 	•	 	
annual individual performance awards are limited to 500,000 shares, and the sum of cash and value of common stock underlying an award paid to any one individual in any one year is limited to $10,000,000; and

 
 	•	 	
no more than 4,156,037 shares can be issued pursuant to incentive options during the life of the 2006 plan.

Administration of the 2006 Plan.    The 2006 plan is administered by a committee of our board of directors, which has broad authority to:
 
 	•	 	
interpret the 2006 plan and all 2006 plan awards;

 
 	•	 	
make, amend and rescind any rules as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the 2006 plan;

 
 	•	 	
make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2006 plan; and

 
 	•	 	
correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2006 plan and award made under the 2006 plan.

The board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the 2006 plan without the consent of any person, but no amendment, suspension or termination of the 2006 plan may, without the consent of the holder of an award, terminate such award or materially adversely affect such person’s rights with respect to such award. No amendment can be effective prior to its approval by our stockholders, to the extent that such approval is required by applicable legal requirements or any exchange on which our common stock is listed. Any action taken or determination made by the committee will be final, binding and conclusive on all affected persons.
Granting of Awards to Participants.    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2006 plan, the committee has broad authority to determine who may participate in the 2006 plan and the type and size of the
 
138
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

awards to participants. Any employee, service provider or non-employee director may be selected by the committee to participate in the 2006 plan. In selecting participants and determining awards, the committee may consider the contribution the recipient has made and/or may make to our growth and any other factors that it may deem relevant. No member of the committee will vote or act upon any matter relating solely to himself, and grants of awards to members of the committee must be ratified by our board of directors.
Eligibility.    Except as set forth below with respect to incentive options, all awards may be granted by the committee to any employee, service provider or non-employee director who performs services for the company or an affiliate and who is determined by the committee to be eligible for an award.
Type of 2006 Plan Awards.    Awards granted under the 2006 plan may include any of the following:
 
 	•	 	
non-qualified options are options to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant. Options may not be repriced without stockholder approval;

 
 	•	 	
incentive options are options designed to meet certain tax code provisions, which provide favorable tax treatment to optionees if certain conditions are met. Incentive options are issued at an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market value per share (or 110% of fair market value per share if issued to 10% stockholders) on the date of grant and may only be granted to our employees;

 
 	•	 	
restricted stock units are rights to receive a specified number of shares of our common stock or the fair market value of such common stock in cash upon expiration of the deferral period specified for such restricted stock units by the committee;

 
 	•	 	
restricted stock is common stock which is transferred to the participant subject to such forfeiture and other restrictions as the committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Restricted stock may not be transferred by the participant prior to the lapse of such restrictions;

 
 	•	 	
stock appreciation rights are rights to receive shares of our common stock, the value of which is equal to the spread or excess of (1) the fair market value per share on the date of exercise over (2) the fair market value per share on the date of grant with respect to a specified number of shares of common stock; and

 
 	•	 	
our common stock may be sold or granted as a bonus under the 2006 plan to participants, in the discretion of the committee, on such terms and conditions as it may establish.

Performance Awards.    The committee may grant performance awards to employees, service providers or non-employee directors based on performance criteria measured over a period of not less than one year and not more than five years. The committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions and may exercise its discretion to increase the amounts payable under any award subject to performance conditions. The performance goals for performance awards will consist of one or more business criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the committee. For any award granted to an employee that is intended to meet the requirements of the performance-based exception of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), one or more of the following business criteria will be used by the committee in establishing performance goals for performance awards granted to a participant:
 
 	•	 	
earnings per share;

 
 	•	 	
increase in revenues;

 
 	•	 	
increase in cash flow;

 
 	•	 	
increase in cash flow return;

 
 	•	 	
return on net assets;

 
 	•

 	•	 	
reduction of expenses.

Any of the performance goals may be determined on an absolute or relative basis or as compared to the performance of a published or special index deemed applicable by the committee, including the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index or components thereof or a group of comparable companies.
Vesting of Awards and Exercise of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.    Except as otherwise determined by the committee and set forth in any award or other agreement, upon a participant’s termination of service prior to vesting or during the applicable deferral period, the award will be forfeited by the participant pursuant to its terms, or if so provided under the terms for the award, shall continue subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions set by the committee with respect to each award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless specifically provided to the contrary by the committee in the award, upon (1) the termination of an employee or service provider without cause, or termination by an employee or service provider with good reason within one year from the effective date of a change of control or (2) death or disability of the participant, any options or restricted stock awarded to such participant will become vested. Options and stock appreciation rights which are not vested are terminated upon termination of employment for any reason other than death or disability. Options and stock appreciation rights which are vested may be exercised for a period of three months after termination for any reason other than death, disability or a for-cause termination by us. Options and stock appreciation rights terminate immediately in the case of a for-cause termination. In the event of death or disability of the participant, the options or stock appreciation rights are exercisable for one year after the termination.
Share Counting and Forfeitures.    Shares issued in connection with the exercise of an award, other than those withheld from issuance for the payment of taxes or exercise price, will no longer be available for any further award under the 2006 plan. When an award is forfeited or can no longer be exercised or paid due to forfeiture, the number of shares released from such award will thereafter be available under the 2006 plan for the grant of additional awards. If any stock-denominated award is paid in cash, forfeited or otherwise lapses, expires, terminates or is canceled without the delivery of shares, then the number of shares subject to such award will be added back to the share “pool” and be available for future awards. With respect to a dollar-denominated award that is paid in shares, the share “pool” will be reduced by the number of shares delivered to pay such dollar-denominated award.

Term of Awards.    The term or restricted period of each award that is an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock unit or restricted stock will be for such period as may be determined by the committee, not to exceed a period of 10 years.
Mergers, Recapitalization, Etc.    In the event of a merger in which we are not the surviving corporation, or in the event of a transaction in which substantially all of our stock or assets is acquired, the committee may in its discretion terminate all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights by giving 20 days notice. The holder of such award will have the right to exercise the options or stock appreciation rights during the 20-day period. If the options or stock appreciation rights are not terminated in this manner, or if the outstanding shares of stock are changed into or converted into a different number or kind of shares or other property (including cash) pursuant to certain corporate transactions, the committee will make appropriate adjustments to the awards to prevent enlargement or dilution of value.
401(k) Plan
Under our client services arrangement with Administaff, both we and Administaff are intended to be co-employers of our employees. Accordingly, our employees participate in the Administaff 401(k) plan to provide them with retirement benefits and with a means to save for their retirement. The 401(k) plan is intended to be a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Indemnification Agreements
We have entered into indemnification agreements with all of our directors and executive officers under which we have agreed to indemnify such persons against all direct and indirect costs of any type or nature whatsoever (including attorneys’ fees) incurred as a result of the fact that such person, in his or her capacity as a director or officer, is made or threatened to be made a party to any suit or proceeding. These persons are indemnified to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The indemnification agreements also provide for the advancement of expenses to these directors and officers in connection with any such suit or proceeding.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The descriptions set forth below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable agreements, copies of which will be filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.
Registration Rights for Certain Holders of Our Common Stock
If we propose to register any of our capital stock under the Securities Act (except on Forms S-4 or S-8), certain holders of common stock will be entitled to customary “piggyback” registration rights, subject to certain lock-up provisions and exceptions. Certain of these holders are selling in this offering pursuant to these piggyback rights. Holders of our common stock that have been granted registration rights include Messrs. Chiste, Magnotti and Wren, each an executive officer, and Acorn Factor, EnerTech Capital Partners II L.P., Rockport Capital Partners, L.P., Emerson Venture Capital, Nth Power Management II-A, L.P., Nth Power Management II, L.P., and E.ON Venture Partners GmbH, each a holder of more than 5% of our voting capital stock at the time such registration rights were granted. Additionally, by majority consent of the shares held by certain stockholders, certain of these holders have the right to demand of us, on certain terms and subject to certain conditions, that we register under the Securities Act the shares of common stock held by such persons. The first date on which such holders can demand registration will be the first anniversary of the closing date of the Enerwise acquisition.
Office Lease
dsIT Solutions Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Acorn Factor, a holder of more than 5% of our common stock, charged our Israeli subsidiary, Comverge Control Systems, Ltd., $56,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, $112,000 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and $138,000 in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 in consideration of it providing office space and certain accounting and administrative services pursuant to a lease, equipment and office services agreement. We have reduced our presence in Israel over the last two years and currently employ four engineers who support our U.S. development effort. We are in the process of phasing out and closing our Israeli office.
Convertible Debt and Warrant
Partners for Growth, L.P., the lender of our convertible debt, became one of our stockholders in February 2006 by investing in our Series C convertible preferred stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, we made interest payments of $219,000 on the convertible debt. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we made interest payments on the convertible debt of $326,000 and $130,000, respectively, in addition to paying Partners for Growth an $80,000 placement fee in 2005 related to the convertible debt.
In connection with issuing the convertible debt in June 2005, we issued Partners for Growth a warrant to purchase 551,693 shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock for $7.24 per share. The warrant is exercisable only if we prepay the convertible debt. The warrant expires upon the earliest to occur of June 7, 2010 or the conversion of any portion of the convertible debt outstanding into shares of our capital stock pursuant to the terms of the convertible debt.
On April 12, 2007, Partners for Growth converted $1.0 million of convertible debt and was issued 138,121 shares of Series B preferred stock, thereby reducing the warrant by the same number of shares. The Series B preferred stock was converted to common shares on a one share for one share basis effective in connection with the closing of our initial public offering on April 18, 2007. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Indebtedness—Subordinated Convertible Loan Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the convertible debt.

Acquisition of Enerwise
Certain investment funds affiliated with EnerTech Capital Partners, one of our significant stockholders, were stockholders of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc. immediately prior to our acquisition of Enerwise and held approximately 36% of Enerwise’s capital stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, one of our directors, Scott Ungerer, is a Managing Partner of EnerTech Capital Partners. Accordingly, upon the closing of our acquisition of Enerwise, the EnerTech affiliated entities received approximately 513,000 shares of our common stock, convertible promissory notes representing approximately $6.8 million of indebtedness and $7.7 million of cash. In addition, the EnerTech affiliated entities had an opportunity to receive up to 76,700 shares of our common stock if Enerwise achieves certain performance metrics during 2008.
Strategic Marketing and Development Agreement and Warrant
In February 2006, we entered into a strategic marketing and development agreement with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., or Air Products, one of our stockholders. Pursuant to the agreement, we and Air Products cooperate in the marketing of our VPC programs to commercial and industrial consumers of electricity in North America and Europe. We have agreed to compensate Air Products by paying it a portion of the revenues that we receive from electric utility customers who compensate, either directly or indirectly through us, commercial and industrial participants after certain conditions are fulfilled by Air Products. As of September 30, 2007 we had not made any payments to Air Products pursuant to the terms of the agreement.
In connection with entering into the strategic marketing and development agreement, we issued a warrant to Air Products in February 2006 to purchase 250,000 shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock for $15.00 per share. Effective with the closing of the initial public offering on April 18, 2007, the warrant became exercisable for shares of our common stock on a one share for one share basis. The warrant is exercisable only if Air Products meets certain defined performance milestones under the agreement, as specified in the warrant. To date, the performance milestones have not been met. The warrant expires upon the earlier to occur of August 12, 2008, or the closing of a change of control as defined in the warrant.

White-Rodgers, a division of Emerson Electric Co., the ultimate parent of Emerson Ventures Inc., a holder of our common stock, supplies thermostats to us pursuant to a restated communicating thermostat co-development and supply agreement dated as of June 1, 2005. Pursuant to the agreement, White-Rodgers has agreed to develop one or more customized thermostats to be combined with our communication interfaces. We have agreed to pay White-Rodgers a specified amount for co-development expenses with respect to each customized thermostat model and a specified price for each unit produced. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, we paid White-Rodgers $1.7 million.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
The following description of the material terms of our capital stock contained in the fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation is only a summary. You should read it together with our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our second amended and restated bylaws.
General
Our authorized capital stock consists of 150,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which shares of preferred stock are undesignated. Our board of directors may establish the rights and preferences of the preferred stock from time to time. As of November 30, 2007, there were 19,525,672 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
As of November 30, 2007, we had approximately 107 holders of our common stock.
Common Stock
Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters voted upon by our stockholders, including the election of directors, and do not have cumulative voting rights. Subject to the rights of holders of any then outstanding shares of our preferred stock, our common stockholders are entitled to receive ratably any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. Holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in our net assets upon our dissolution or liquidation after payment or provision for all liabilities and any preferential liquidation rights of our preferred stock then outstanding. Holders of our common stock do not have preemptive rights to purchase shares of our stock. The shares of our common stock are not subject to any redemption or sinking fund provisions and are not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock. All outstanding shares of our common stock are, and the shares of common stock to be issued in this offering will be upon payment therefor, fully paid and nonassessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock that we may issue in the future.
Preferred Stock
Our board of directors may, from time to time, authorize the issuance of one or more classes or series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. We have no current intention to issue any shares of preferred stock and as of the date of this prospectus no shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding.
Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock from time to time. Subject to the provisions of our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and limitations prescribed by law, our board of directors is authorized to adopt resolutions to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series, establish the number of shares, change the number of shares constituting any series, and provide or change the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions on shares of our preferred stock, including dividend rights, dividend rates, terms of redemption, redemption prices, conversion rights and rates and liquidation preferences, which may be superior to those of common stock, in each case without any action or vote by our stockholders.
The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders by, among other things:
 
 	•	 	
restricting dividends on the common stock or rank prior to the common stock as to dividend rights;

 
 	•	 	
diluting the voting power of the common stock;

 
149
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	•	 	
diluting the ownership of the common stock by being convertible into shares of common stock;

 
 	•	 	
impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock; or

 
 	•	 	
delaying or preventing a change in control without further action by the stockholders.

As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could discourage bids for the common stock or otherwise have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.
See “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions—Convertible Debt and Warrant” and “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions—Strategic Marketing and Development Agreement and Warrant” for information on the number of shares of common stock subject to existing warrants, the period during which and the price at which the warrants are exercisable and other material terms of the warrants.
Anti-Takeover Effects of our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws
The provisions of our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws described below could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions also are intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock and, as a consequence, they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
Classified Board.    Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors, with the classes to be as nearly equal in number as possible. As a result, approximately one-third of our board of directors will be elected each year. The classification of directors will have the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board.
Written Consent of Stockholders.    Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by written consent. Elimination of actions by written consent of stockholders may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions because actions by written consent are not subject to the minimum notice requirement of a stockholder’s meeting. However, we believe that the elimination of actions by written consent of the stockholders may deter hostile takeover attempts. Without the availability of actions by written consent of the stockholders, a holder controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to amend our second amended and restated bylaws without holding a stockholders meeting. To hold such a meeting, the holder would have to obtain the consent of a majority of the board of directors, the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer to call a stockholders’ meeting and satisfy the applicable notice provisions set forth in our second amended and restated bylaws.
Amendment of the Bylaws.    Under Delaware law, the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws is conferred upon the stockholders. A corporation may, however, in its certificate of incorporation also confer upon the board of directors the power to adopt, amend or repeal its bylaws. Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws grant our board the power to alter, amend and repeal our bylaws, or adopt new bylaws, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office. Our stockholders may alter, amend or repeal our bylaws, or adopt new bylaws, but only at any regular or special meeting of stockholders by an affirmative vote of not less than 66 2/3% in voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, voting together as a single class.

Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation.    Upon the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, voting together as a single class, stockholders may repeal or amend in any respect, or add any provision inconsistent with, the provisions of Article V (relating to directors), Article VI (relating to the amendment of our bylaws), Article VII (relating to actions and meetings of stockholders), Article VIII (relating to indemnification and insurance) and Article IX (relating to the amendment of our certificate of incorporation) of our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The “supermajority” voting provisions may discourage or deter a person from attempting to obtain control of Comverge by making it more difficult to amend some provisions of our certificate of incorporation or for our stockholders to amend any provision of our bylaws, whether to eliminate provisions that have anti-takeover effect or those that protect the interests of minority stockholders.
Special Meetings of Stockholders.    Our second amended and restated bylaws preclude the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders or to require the board of directors or any officer to call such a meeting or to propose business at such a meeting. Our second amended and restated bylaws provide that only a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer can call a special meeting of stockholders. Because our stockholders do not have the right to call a special meeting, a stockholder can not force stockholder consideration of a proposal over the opposition of the board of directors by calling a special meeting of stockholders prior to the time a majority of the board of directors, the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer believes the matter should be considered or until the next annual meeting provided that the requestor met the notice requirements. The restriction on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting means that a proposal to replace board members also can be delayed until the next annual meeting.
Limitation of Liability of Officers and Directors.    Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, no director or officer shall be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer. The effect of this provision is to eliminate our rights and the rights of our stockholders, through stockholders’ derivative suits on our behalf, to recover monetary damages against a director or officer for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, as applicable, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior.
Other Limitations on Stockholder Actions.    Advance notice is required for stockholders to nominate directors or to submit proposals for consideration at meetings of stockholders. This provision may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper notice is not provided and may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. In addition, the ability of our stockholders to remove directors without cause is precluded.
No Cumulative Voting.    Although Section 214 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provides that a corporation’s certificate of incorporation may provide for cumulative voting for directors, our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, the holders of a majority of the votes of the outstanding shares of our common stock have the ability to elect all of the directors being elected at any annual meeting of stockholders.
Blank-Check Preferred.    Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that permit our board of directors to issue, without any further vote or action by our stockholders, up to 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, as described above. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stockholders or otherwise be in their best interest.

Delaware Anti-Takeover Law
Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provides that, subject to exceptions specified therein, an “interested stockholder” of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any “business combination,” including generally mergers or consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares of the corporation, with the corporation for a three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless:
 
 	•	 	
prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

 
 	•	 	
upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an “interested stockholder,” the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding specified shares); or

 
 	
•

 	
on or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.

Under Section 203, the restrictions described above also do not apply to specified business combinations proposed by an interested stockholder following the announcement or notification of one of the specified transactions involving the corporation and a person who had not been an interested stockholder during the previous three years or who became an interested stockholder with the approval of a majority of the corporation’s directors, if such transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of the directors who were directors prior to any person becoming an interested stockholder during the previous three years or were recommended for election or elected to succeed such directors by a majority of such directors. The restrictions described above also do not apply to specified business combinations with a person who is an “interested stockholder” prior to the time when the corporation’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, so these restrictions would not apply to a business combination with any person who is our stockholder prior to this offering.
Except as otherwise specified in Section 203, an “interested stockholder” is defined to include:
 
 	•	 	
any person that is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within three years immediately prior to the date of determination; and

 
 	•	 	
the affiliates and associates of any such person.

Under some circumstances, Section 203 makes it more difficult for a person who is an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with us for a three-year period. We have not elected to be exempt from the restrictions imposed under Section 203.
Nasdaq Global Market Listing
Our common stock is listed under the symbol “COMV” on the Nasdaq Global Market.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE
We can make no predictions as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price prevailing from time to time. Nevertheless, sales of significant amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices and impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity or equity-related securities at a time and price we deem appropriate.
Based on our last reported stock price of $31.48 on November 30, 2007, upon the completion of this offering, we will have 20,463,793 shares of our common stock outstanding. Of these shares, 10,095,000 shares (or in the event the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised, 10,695,000 shares) of our common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares of our common stock purchased by our “affiliates,” as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which would be subject to the limitations and restrictions described below.
The remaining 10,368,793 shares of our common stock outstanding upon completion of this offering are deemed “restricted securities,” as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, and are subject to the lock-up agreements described in “Underwriting.” Restricted securities may be sold in the U.S. public market only if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144, Rule 144(k) or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which rules are summarized below.
Rule 144
In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person, or persons whose shares must be aggregated, who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least one year is entitled to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of the following:
 
 	•	 	
one percent of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, which will equal approximately 204,638 shares immediately after this offering, or

 
 	•	 	
the average weekly trading volume of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market during the four calendar weeks preceding the date of filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.

Sales under Rule 144 are also generally subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Rule 144 also provides that affiliates that sell our common stock that are not restricted shares must nonetheless comply with the same restrictions applicable to restricted shares, other than the holding period requirement.
Rule 144(k)
Under Rule 144(k), a person, or persons whose shares must be aggregated, who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least two years would be entitled to sell the shares under Rule 144(k) without complying with the manner of sale, public information, volume limitations or notice or public information requirements of Rule 144. Therefore, unless otherwise restricted, the shares eligible for sale under Rule 144(k) may be sold immediately upon the completion of this offering.
A significant number of our shares outstanding prior to this offering are held by our affiliates, and therefore will not be saleable under Rule 144(k) unless such stockholder ceases to be an affiliate and has not been an affiliate during the 90 days preceding a sale, and any such sale could be made only following expiration or waiver of the lock-up agreements.

Rule 701
Our employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors who purchased shares from us pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or written contracts relating to the compensation of such persons before the effective date of our initial public offering are entitled to rely on the resale provisions of Rule 701, subject to the lock-up agreements described below. Rule 701 will also apply to stock options we granted before the effective date of our initial public offering along with the shares acquired upon exercise of those options. In general, because 90 days have passed since the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering, Rule 701 permits our non-affiliates to sell their Rule 701 shares without having to comply with the public information, holding period, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144 and permits our affiliates to sell their Rule 701 shares without having to comply with the holding period of Rule 144.
Lock-up Agreements
The selling stockholders and our officers, directors and certain of other stockholders will have entered into lock-up agreements under which they have agreed not to transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of our common stock held by them or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock for a period of at least 90 days from the date of this prospectus without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. These restrictions, and certain exceptions and extensions, are described in more detail under the caption “Underwriting.”
Options
As of September 30, 2007, stock options to purchase a total of 2,152,733 shares of our common stock were outstanding under our 2006 plan. These stock options have a weighted average exercise price of $10.94 per share and a weighted average of 5.3 years until expiration.
On April 18, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering 4,156,037 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2006 plan. Accordingly, shares registered under the registration statement are, available for sale in the open market, except to the extent that the shares are subject to Rule 144 provisions applicable to affiliates or the shares are subject to vesting restrictions or the lock-up restrictions described above.
Registration Rights
Approximately 51 holders of our common stock will have rights to require or participate in the registration of those shares under the Securities Act at various times after completion of this offering. For a detailed description of these registration rights, see “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions—Registration Rights for Certain Holders of Our Common Stock.”

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF
COMMON STOCK
The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences to non-U.S. holders with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common stock. In general, a “non-U.S. holder” for purposes of this discussion is any holder of our common stock other than the following:
 
 	•	 	
an individual citizen or resident of the U.S., including an alien individual who is a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. or meets the “substantial presence” test under section 7701(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;

 
 	•	 	
a corporation (or an entity treated as a corporation) created or organized in the U.S. or under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

 
 	•	 	
a partnership (or an entity treated as a partnership);

 
 	•	 	
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

 
 	•	 	
a trust, if a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons can control all substantial decisions of the trust, or certain other trusts that have a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person pursuant to the applicable Treasury Regulations.

This discussion is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, final, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and all other applicable administrative and judicial authorities, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income and estate taxation or any aspects of state, local, or foreign taxation, nor does it consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to particular non-U.S. holders that may be subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws including, but not limited to, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, persons holding our common stock as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or a straddle or other risk-reduction transaction, tax-exempt organizations, pass-through entities, banks or financial institutions, brokers, dealers in securities, and U.S. expatriates. If a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. This discussion assumes that the non-U.S. holder will hold our common stock as a capital asset, which generally is property held for investment.
Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign income and other tax considerations of acquiring, holding and disposing of shares of our common stock.
Dividends
In general, dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder (to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles) will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate equal to 30% of the gross amount of the dividend, or a lower rate prescribed by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the dividends are effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the U.S. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, a non-U.S. holder will be required to satisfy certain certification requirements, generally on IRS Form W-8BEN, or any successor form, directly or through an intermediary, in order to claim a reduced rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty. If tax is withheld in an amount in excess of the amount applicable under an income tax treaty, a refund of the excess amount may generally be obtained by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.
Dividends that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business generally will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax if the non-U.S. holder files the properly completed required forms, including IRS Form W-8ECI,
 
155

or any successor form, with the payor of the dividend, but instead generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a resident of the U.S. A corporate non-U.S. holder that receives effectively connected dividends may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or a lower rate prescribed by an applicable income tax treaty, on the repatriation from the U.S. of its “effectively connected earnings and profits,” subject to adjustments.
Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock
In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of the non-U.S. holder’s shares of common stock unless:
 
 	•	 	
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the U.S. (and, where an income tax treaty applies, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the non-U.S. holder), in which case the branch profits tax discussed above may also apply if the non-U.S. holder is a corporation;

 
 	•	 	
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who holds shares of common stock as capital assets and is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other conditions are met; or

 
 	•	 	
we are or have been a “U.S. real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes during specified periods.

In general, we would be a U.S. real property holding corporation if interests in U.S. real estate comprised a majority of our assets. We believe that we are not, and do not anticipate becoming, a U.S. real property holding corporation.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, we must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends paid, the name and address of the recipient, and the amount, if any, of tax withheld. A similar report is sent to the recipient. These information reporting requirements apply even if withholding was not required because the dividends were effectively connected dividends or withholding was reduced by an applicable income tax treaty. Under income tax treaties or other agreements, the IRS may make its reports available to tax authorities in the recipient’s country of residence.
Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder that is not an exempt recipient generally will be subject to backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28% unless the non-U.S. holder certifies as to its foreign status, which certification may be made on IRS Form W-8BEN.
Proceeds from the disposition of common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected by or through a U.S. office of a broker will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28% of the gross proceeds, unless the non-U.S. holder certifies to the payor under penalties of perjury as to, among other things, its address and its foreign status or otherwise establishes an exemption.
Generally, U.S. information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds if the transaction is effected outside the U.S. by or through a non-U.S. office. However, if the broker is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. person, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign person who derives 50% or more of its gross income for specified periods from the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, specified U.S. branches of foreign banks or insurance companies or a foreign partnership with various connections to the U.S., information reporting, but not backup withholding, will apply unless:
 
 	•	 	
the broker has documentary evidence in its files that the holder is a non-U.S. holder and certain other conditions are met; or

 
 	•	 	
the holder otherwise establishes an exemption.

 
156

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of tax withheld is applied as a credit to the U.S. federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of U.S. federal income taxes, a refund may be obtained, provided the required documents are timely filed with the IRS.
Estate Tax
Our common stock owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the U.S. (as specifically defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes) at the time of death will be includible in the individual’s gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise.
THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT THERETO. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGE IN APPLICABLE LAWS.

The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the shares included in this offering are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to purchase all the shares (other than those covered by the over-allotment option described below) if they purchase any of the shares.
The underwriters propose to offer some of the shares directly to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and some of the shares to dealers at the public offering price less a concession not to exceed $                     per share. If all of the shares are not sold at the initial offering price, the representatives may change the public offering price and the other selling terms.
We and the selling stockholders have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to 600,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price less the underwriting discount. The underwriters may exercise the option solely for the purpose of covering over- allotments, if any, in connection with this offering. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter must purchase a number of additional shares approximately proportionate to that underwriter’s initial purchase commitment.
We, our officers and directors, the selling stockholders and certain of our other stockholders have agreed that, for a period of 90 days from the date of this prospectus, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., dispose of or hedge any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. Although we are not currently engaged in any negotiations for acquisitions, we will be permitted to issue, in the aggregate, shares of our common stock that have a market value of up to $25.0 million as of issuance thereof in connection with bona fide acquisitions that we might consummate, it being understood that any recipient of such shares will be subject to the original 90-day lock-up period. If we release earnings results or announce material news during the last 17 days of the lock-up period, or if prior to the expiration of the lock-up period we announce that we will release earnings during the 15-day period following the last day of the lock-up period, then the lock-up period will automatically be extended until the end of the 18-day period beginning with the earnings release or material news announcement. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. in their sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice.
Each underwriter has represented, warranted and agreed that:

In connection with this offering, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., on behalf of the underwriters, may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, syndicate covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve syndicate sales of common stock in excess of the number of shares to be purchased by the underwriters in this offering, which creates a syndicate short position. “Covered” short sales are sales of shares made in an amount up to the number of shares represented by the underwriters’ over-allotment option. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered syndicate short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. Transactions to close out the covered syndicate short involve either purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed or the exercise of the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also make “naked” short sales of shares in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares of common stock in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of bids for or purchases of shares in the open market while this offering is in progress.
The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Goldman, Sachs & Co. repurchases shares originally sold by that syndicate member in order to cover syndicate short positions or make stabilizing purchases.
Any of these activities may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock. They may also cause the price of the common stock to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The underwriters may conduct these transactions on the Nasdaq Global Market or in the over-the-counter market, or otherwise. If the underwriters commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.
In addition, in connection with this offering, some of the underwriters (and selling group members) may engage in passive market making transactions in the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market, prior to the pricing and completion of the offering. Passive market making consists of displaying bids on the Nasdaq Global Market no higher than the bid prices of independent market makers and making purchases at prices no higher than those independent bids and effected in response to order flow. Net purchases by a passive market maker on each day are limited to a specified percentage of the passive market maker’s average daily trading volume in the common stock during a specified period and must be discontinued when that limit is reached. Passive market making may cause the price of the common stock to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of those transactions. If the underwriters commence passive market making transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The representatives will allocate shares to underwriters that may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations. In addition, shares may be sold by the underwriters to securities dealers who resell shares to online brokerage account holders.
We and the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, or to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.

1.	 	Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Liquidity
Description of Business
Comverge, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), provides (i) smart grid solutions to utilities and other energy customers consisting of demand response systems comprised of hardware, software and installation services (“Smart Grid Solutions Group”), (ii) electric capacity to utility customers primarily during periods of peak energy demand (“Alternative Energy Resources Group”), and (iii) energy management and demand response solutions to large commercial and industrial consumers (“Enerwise Group”). Prior to April 2003, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acorn Factor, Inc. (formerly known as Data Systems & Software, Inc.) (“AFI”).
On July 23, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding securities of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc. (“Enerwise Group”). The Enerwise Group is an energy infrastructure management, demand response and renewable energy services and technology provider that enables commercial and industrial customers to reduce energy consumption and total costs, improve energy infrastructure reliability and make informed decisions regarding energy and renewable energy purchases and programs. The Enerwise Group has been designated a new operating segment for management and external reporting purposes.
On September 29, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Public Energy Solutions, LLC, and its related entities (collectively, “PES”). PES is an energy efficiency company that implements permanent base load reduction solutions for commercial and industrial customers under long-term, pay-for-performance contracts with a utility. PES became part of the Alternative Energy Resources Group operating segment.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of its subsidiaries. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2007. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2007 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2006 and 2007. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. For further information, refer to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2006 filed in the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1.
Reverse Stock Split
On April 18, 2007, the Company affected a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of its common stock in connection with the closing of its initial public offering. All common shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes for all periods presented.

Liquidity
The Company has a history of recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations. Historically, the Company has funded cash needs through the issuance of preferred stock and subordinated convertible debt financing. On April 18, 2007, the Company completed the initial public offering of its common shares. Aggregate proceeds from the offering, net of related expenses, were $86.0 million. The Company plans to use these net proceeds to finance the capital requirements of its current and future Virtual Peaking Capacity (“VPC”) contracts, to finance research and development, to repay indebtedness, to fund any cash consideration for future acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Enerwise and PES, and for other general corporate purposes. Management believes that available cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings available under the Company’s credit agreements will be sufficient to meet the Company’s capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
The Company’s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others: a history of annual losses since inception, the potential requirement to make refunds to customers, significant revenues from contracts with a small number of customers, the ability to fully receive the payments estimated from long-term contracts and recognize revenues from backlog, reliance on key third-parties to manufacture its products, litigation, the need to retain key personnel and the ability to integrate completed acquisitions. Any of these factors could impair the Company’s ability to expand its operations or to generate significant revenue and cash flows from those markets in which it operates. As a result of the above and other factors, the Company’s earnings and financial condition can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
 
2.	 	Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenues when the following criteria have been met: delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, collection is probable, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.
In accordance with SAB 104, the Company defers revenue and associated cost of revenue in its Alternative Energy Resources Group segment related to certain long-term VPC contracts until such time as the annual contract price is fixed and determinable. Revenue is invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis throughout the contract year. The VPC contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers, and require a measurement and verification of such capacity on an annual basis in order to determine final contract consideration for a given contract year. Contract years begin at the end of a control season (generally, at the end of a utility’s summer cooling season that correlates to the end of the utility’s peak demand for electricity) and continue for twelve months thereafter.
The Company, through the acquisition of PES, enters into agreements to provide base load capacity services to utilities or commercial and industrial end customers. Base load capacity revenues are earned based on the Company’s ability to achieve committed capacity through load reduction. In order to provide capacity, the Company delivers and installs demand side management measures to a portfolio of commercial and industrial end customers. The base load capacity contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers, and include a measurement and verification of such capacity in order to determine contract consideration. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company defers revenue and associated cost of revenue in its electric load reduction services until such time as the capacity amount and therefore the related revenue is fixed and determinable. Once the capacity amount has been verified, the revenue is recognized. If the revenue is subject to penalty, refund or an ongoing obligation, the revenue is deferred until the contingency is

resolved and/or the Company has met its performance obligation. Certain PES contracts are accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 00-21, which requires the Company to assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting. The separate deliverables in these arrangements meet the separation criteria. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each element by applying the residual method under EITF No. 00-21 since there is objective evidence of fair value of only the undelivered item. The amount allocated to the delivered item is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of the additional element.
The Enerwise Group segment enters into agreements to provide demand response and capacity event services. The demand response contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility end customers when the utility calls a demand response event to curtail electrical usage. Demand response revenues are earned based on the Company’s ability to deliver capacity. In order to provide capacity, the Company manages a portfolio of commercial and industrial end users’ electric loads. Capacity amounts are verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a customer initiated demand response test. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company recognizes revenue and associated cost of revenue in its demand response services at such time as the capacity amount is fixed and determinable.
Capacity event services revenue is contingent revenue earned based upon the actual amount of energy provided during the capacity event. Contingent revenue from capacity events is recognized when the capacity amount and therefore the related revenue is fixed and determinable.
The Smart Grid Solutions Group sells hardware products directly to utilities for use and deployment by the utility. In addition, it provides installation services under a long-term service contract with one of our customers. The Company recognizes revenue for such sales when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and all other criteria of SAB 104 have been met.
The deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue as of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007 are provided below:

The Company has certain contracts which are multiple element arrangements and provide for several deliverables to the customer that may include installation services, right to use software, hardware and hosting services. The Company applies Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-3, Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another

Entity’s Hardware, to multiple element arrangements that include software hosting services. For contracts that include software hosting services, the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty. Therefore, in accordance with EITF 00-3, AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, does not apply to these contracts. Accordingly, these contracts are accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00-21 requires that the Company assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting. Because the Company does not have objective evidence of the fair value of each element, the elements do not qualify for separate accounting. Accordingly, revenue for all elements is recognized ratably over the longer of the estimated customer relationship period or the life of the contract, once all revenue recognition requirements are met. Straight-line attribution is used because there is no other discernible pattern of use that suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
Revenue from time-and-materials service contracts and other services are recognized as services are provided. Revenues from certain fixed price contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis, which involves the use of estimates. If the Company does not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion, revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when final acceptance is received from the customer. The Company also enters into agreements to provide hosting services that allow customers to monitor and analyze their electrical usage. Revenue from hosting contracts is recognized as the services are provided, generally on a recurring monthly basis. Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.
In accordance with EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the Company reports shipping and handling revenues and their associated costs in revenue and cost of revenue, respectively. In accordance with EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products), the Company records incentive payments made to participants in its VPC programs as cost of revenue.
Comprehensive Loss
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. The Company reports total changes in equity resulting from revenues, expenses, and gains and losses, including those that do not affect the accumulated deficit. Accordingly, other comprehensive loss includes those amounts relating to unrealized gains and losses on investment securities classified as available for sale in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive loss.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue from products and services that it supplies to electricity providers such as utilities and independent service operators. Changes in economic conditions and unforeseen events could occur and could have the effect of reducing use of electricity by our customers’ consumers. The Company’s business success depends in part on its relationships with a limited number of large customers.

The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities by placing its cash and cash equivalents with a number of domestic financial institutions and by investing in investment grade securities.
Marketable Securities
The Company classifies all of its marketable securities as available-for-sale. The Company considers all highly liquid interest-earning securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Securities with maturities beyond three months are classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities and long-term marketable securities are classified as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These securities are recorded at market value using the specific identification method; unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and on a cumulative basis included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the financial statements.
The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities, with gross unrealized gains and losses, as of September 30, 2007 were as follows:

Realized gains and losses to date have not been material. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $1,784. The Company held no marketable securities on December 31, 2006.
Goodwill and Intangibles, net
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identified intangible assets of businesses acquired in purchase transactions. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not being amortized. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis, on December 31 of each year. Based on the Company’s most recent impairment test completed as of December 31, 2006, there has been no impairment loss recognized for goodwill.
The costs of identified intangible assets are presented at their fair value at acquisition date. The Company amortizes identified intangible assets over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the projected utility of such assets based upon the information available. The amortization expense related to acquired software is recorded in the respective cost of revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The costs of registered patents and patents pending acquired from third-parties are presented at their cost as of the acquisition date. In addition, registration costs and fees for patents are capitalized. Registered patent costs are amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the patents, from four to fourteen years. Costs for patents pending are not amortized until they are issued.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements. SFAS No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value measures in financial statements, but standardizes its definition and guidance in GAAP. The Standard emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and not an entity-specific measurement based on an exchange transaction in which the entity sells an asset or transfers a liability (exit price). SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest level to fair value based on an entity’s own fair value assumptions as the lowest level. SFAS No. 157 is to be effective for the Company’s financial statements issued in 2008. The Company believes that SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 115, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. A business entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company believes that SFAS No. 159 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN 48”), an interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (“FASB 109”). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. The Company must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB 109. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not record any unrecognized tax positions as of January 1, 2007 or September 30, 2007.
 
3.	 	Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, when dilutive, potential common shares from options and warrants using the treasury stock method, and from convertible securities using the if-converted method. Because the Company reported a

On July 23, 2007, Comverge completed the acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc (“Enerwise”) for $77.0 million in consideration, comprised of $23.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $17.0 million in subordinated convertible promissory notes payable to Enerwise stockholders and 1,279,545 shares of Comverge common stock, valued at $36.9 million. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 99-12, Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination, the fair value of Comverge common stock to be issued was determined using an average price of $28.82, which was the average closing price of Comverge common stock for a few days before and after the terms of the merger agreement were agreed to and announced. In addition, 191,183 shares of Comverge stock is contingently issuable if Enerwise achieves certain 2008 operating performance results. The additional contingent consideration, should the performance results be achieved, will be recorded as additional goodwill if and when earned.
On September 29, 2007, Comverge completed the acquisition of Public Energy Solutions, LLC, Public Electric, Inc. and PES NY, LLC (collectively, “PES”) for $13.4 million in consideration, comprised of $9.3 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $3.0 million in subordinated convertible promissory notes payable to PES capital members and 34,129 shares of Comverge common stock, valued at $1.1 million. In accordance with EITF No. 99-12, the fair value of Comverge common stock to be issued was determined using a price of $32.86. In addition, $3.0 million in cash and 238,905 shares of Comverge common stock is contingently issuable if PES achieves certain operating performance results for calendar years 2007 and 2008.

These acquisitions were completed primarily to allow the Company to expand its electric load reduction services. The Company allocated the purchase prices of the acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excesses of the purchase prices over the fair values were recorded as goodwill. Management believes the goodwill resulting from the PES acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes. The fair values assigned to intangible assets acquired were based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. Purchased intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives, which represents the most discernible pattern of economic use. The results of operations of each acquisition are included in our results of operations from the closing date of the acquisition. The preliminary allocations of the estimated purchase prices are as follows:

The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not yet complete and are subject to future adjustments. The final purchase price allocation will be based on Enerwise’s closing balance sheet as of July 23, 2007 and PES’ closing balance sheet as of September 29, 2007. The valuations of these significant items are currently in process and management expects the valuations to be completed by the filing of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Prior to the completion of our initial public offering of stock, the fair value of the common stock was determined by the Company contemporaneously with the grants based on the valuation indications for the common stock received from the Company’s investment bankers as part of the public offering. The weighted average grant-date fair value of 905,411 options granted during the nine month period ended September 30, 2007 was $13.32. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued in the nine months ended September 30, 2007, utilizing the following assumptions (weighted averages based on grants during the period):

11.	 	Segment Information
As of September 30, 2007, the Company has three operating and reportable segments: the Smart Grid Solutions Group, the Alternative Energy Resources Group and the Enerwise Group. The Smart Grid Solutions Group sells hardware, software and installation services to utilities that elect to own and operate such demand response networks for their own benefit. The Alternative Energy Resources Group sells electric capacity to utilities on an outsourced basis under long-term contracts. The Alternative Energy Resources Group typically accomplishes this by developing, owning and managing a demand response network on behalf of the utility. The Alternative Energy Resources group also provides utilities program management and marketing services on an outsourced basis. The Enerwise Group provides energy infrastructure management, demand response and renewable energy services and technologies that enable commercial and industrial customers to reduce energy consumption and total costs, improve energy infrastructure reliability and make informed decisions on energy and renewable energy purchases and programs. Only operations of the historical Enerwise entity are included in the Enerwise Group segment, from the date of acquisition by the Company.
Management has three primary measures of segment performance: revenue, gross profit (margin) and operating income. The Alternative Energy Resources Group purchases demand response hardware and software from the Smart Grid Solutions Group. All inter-operating segment revenues are eliminated in consolidation. Smart Grid Solutions Group product hardware and software cost of revenue include materials, labor and overhead. Within the Alternative Energy Resources Group, cost of revenue is based on operating costs, primarily telecommunications costs related to the network and depreciation of the assets capitalized in building the demand response network. Operating expenses directly associated with each operating segment include sales, marketing, product development, amortization of intangible assets and certain administrative expenses.
Corporate operating expenses, interest income, interest expense and other income (expense) are not allocated to the operating segments nor included in the measure of segment profit or loss. The Company does not allocate assets and liabilities to its operating segments. All depreciation expense was directly related to the operating segments for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2007. Operating expenses not directly associated with an operating segment are classified as “Corporate Unallocated Costs”. Corporate Unallocated Costs include support group compensation, travel, professional fees and marketing activities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Comverge, Inc. and Subsidiaries:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Comverge, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounted for stock-based compensation in 2006.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
 
1.	 	Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Comverge, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), provides (i) Smart Grid solutions to electric utilities and other energy providers consisting of demand response systems comprised of hardware, software and installation services (“Smart Grid Solutions Group”), and (ii) Alternative Energy Resources through which the Company provides electric capacity to its utility customers during periods of peak energy demand (“Alternative Energy Resources Group”). Prior to April 2003, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acorn Factor, Inc. (formerly known as Data Systems & Software, Inc.) (“AFI”). In April 2003 and continuing thereafter, the Company completed a series of equity and convertible debt financings. After giving effect to these financings, AFI remains the Company’s largest stockholder, owning approximately 25 and 23 percent of the Company’s issued and outstanding voting equity as of December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements presented reflect entries necessary for the fair presentation of the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006. All entries required for the fair presentation of the financial statements are of a normal recurring nature. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
Stock Split
On April 18, 2007, the Company’s affected a 1 for 2 reverse stock split effective immediately prior to the closing of the IPO. All share and per share data have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock split.
Liquidity
The Company has a history of losses and has utilized cash provided from equity and debt financings to fund its operating and investing activities. Historically, the Company has funded cash needs through the issuance of convertible preferred stock and subordinated convertible debt financing. In March 2006, the Company completed an additional equity financing through the sale of its Series C convertible preferred stock. The Company’s Alternative Energy Resources Group requires significant capital to support (i) planned operating losses incurred during the installation phase of long-term contracts, and (ii) working capital requirements incident to the provision of long-term capacity commitments. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing when needed, the Company may be required to reduce its investment in the aforementioned systems and marketing efforts, which may harm its business and operating results. The Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings from its credit facilities, including the net proceeds from its recent private placements of convertible preferred stock, will be sufficient to meet its capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
The Company’s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others: its history of annual losses since inception, its potential requirement to make refunds to customers, significant revenues from contracts with a small number of customers, its ability to fully receive the payments estimated from its long-term

contracts and recognize revenue from its backlog, its failure to meet product development milestones, its dependency on utility industry customers for its revenue, lengthy sales cycles, it operates in highly competitive markets, its ability to expand strategic partnerships to market its products, its reliance on key third-parties to manufacture its products, its use of technology licensed from third-parties, intellectual property litigation, increases in terminations by residential and commercial customers, and the need to retain key personnel. Any of these factors could impair its ability to expand its operations or to generate significant revenue from those markets in which it operates. As a result of the above and other factors, the Company’s earnings and financial condition can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include management’s estimate of provisions required for non-collectible accounts receivable, obsolete or slow-moving inventory, and potential product warranty liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comprehensive Income and Foreign Currency Transactions
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. There was no difference between the Company’s net loss and its total comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
The currency of the primary economic environment in which the operations of the Company are conducted is the United States Dollar (“dollar”). Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries use the dollar as their functional currency. All exchange gains and losses denominated in non-dollar currencies are presented on a net basis in operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations when they arise. Foreign currency gain (loss) amounted to ($4), $14 and $16 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and demand deposits in banks and short-term investments.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of accounts considered to be doubtful of collection as well as historical experience. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, there were $60 and $113, respectively, identified as doubtful of collection.
Inventory, net
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory cost is determined on the basis of specific identification based on acquisition cost, and due provision is made to reduce all slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories to their estimated useful or scrap values. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, there were provisions of $400 and $284, respectively, for inventory identified as slow-moving, obsolete or unusable.

Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. In the case of installed assets that are part of long-term contracts, the assets are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life or the term of the contract. In respect of these installed assets, depreciation expense is recognized as a component of cost of revenue. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or useful life. Improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Gains or losses realized on the disposal or retirement of property and equipment are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
In accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the Company recognizes the fair value of liabilities for asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. As part of the Company’s Alternative Energy Resources Group, the Company installs hardware at residences of select utility customers. At the request of the homeowner, the Company is obligated to remove this hardware. Any associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and recognized as depreciation expense over the asset’s life. The Company’s estimate is based on the historical data for the ratio of cumulative assets removed to the cumulative number of assets installed. Accordingly, in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company recognized an asset retirement obligation liability and an associated adjustment in the cost of long-lived assets of $102, $67 and $53, respectively.
Goodwill and Intangibles, net
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identified intangible assets of businesses acquired in purchase transactions. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not being amortized. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis, on December 31 of each year. Based on the Company’s most recent impairment test completed as of December 31, 2006, there has been no impairment loss recognized for goodwill.
The costs of acquired software are presented at their fair value at acquisition date. The Company amortizes acquired software over the estimated useful lives (three years) using the straight-line method, which approximates the projected utility of such assets based upon the information available. The amortization expense related to acquired software is recorded in the respective cost of revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The costs of registered patents and patents pending acquired from third-parties are presented at their cost as of the acquisition date. In addition, registration costs and fees for patents are capitalized. Registered patent costs are amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the patents, from four to fourteen years. Costs for patents pending are not amortized until they are issued.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets. If such evaluation indicates a potential impairment, a discounted cash flow analysis is used to measure fair value in determining the amount of these assets that should be written off.

Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the corresponding debt instrument using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $29, $55 and $72 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
Debt issuance costs are included in Other assets and consisted of the following as of December 31, 2005 and 2006:

Warranty Provision
The Company generally warrants its products against certain manufacturing and other defects. These product warranties are provided for specific periods of time and/or usage of the product depending on the nature of the product, the geographic location of its sale and other factors. In late 2004, the Company began to outsource manufacturing operations to a contract manufacturer that provides warranty coverage pursuant to the contractual terms of the agreement. The warranty provision included in Other current liabilities is set forth below.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values reported for cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their respective fair values at each balance sheet date due to the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The subordinated convertible debt is stated at fair value as of December 31, 2005 and 2006, as it bears interest at a variable rate.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenues when the following criteria have been met: delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, collection is probable, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.
Revenue from time-and-materials service contracts and other services are recognized as services are provided. Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.

In accordance with SAB No. 104, the Company defers revenue and associated cost of revenue in its Alternative Energy Resources Group related to the long-term Virtual Peaking Capacity (“VPC”) contracts because the receipt of proxy payments under the VPC contracts are subject to a true up at the end of a contract year. The Company defers revenue and the associated cost of revenue under the VPC contracts until such time that the contract price is fixed and determinable, generally the fourth quarter of our fiscal year upon agreement of the capacity factors. The agreement of the factors affecting available capacity is achieved through the completion and acceptance of the measurement and verification results or by agreement with the customer. As a result, most of the revenue of the Company’s Alternative Energy Resources Group, and a significant portion of the Company’s total revenue, is not recognized until the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. During the fourth quarter of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company recognized VPC contract revenue of $1,158, $8,507 and $16,325, respectively. The associated cost of revenue that is deferred under the VPC contracts consists primarily of depreciation costs of load control equipment that is deployed in building the load management system. Contract years begin at the end of a control season (generally, at the end of a utility’s summer cooling season that correlates to the end of the utility’s peak demand for electricity) and continue for twelve months thereafter.
The deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue related to VPC contracts as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 are provided below:

The Company has certain contracts which are multiple element arrangements and provide for several deliverables to the customer that may include installation services, right to use software, hardware and hosting services. The Company considers the applicability of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-3, Application of AICPA Statement of Position No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity’s Hardware, to multiple element arrangements that include software hosting services. For contracts that include software hosting services, the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty. Therefore, in accordance with EITF No. 00-3, AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, does not apply to these contracts. Accordingly, these contracts are accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF No. 00-21 requires that the Company assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting. Because the Company does not have objective evidence of the fair value of each element, the elements do not qualify for separate accounting. Accordingly, revenue for all elements is recognized ratably over the longer of the estimated customer relationship period or the life of the contract, once all revenue recognition requirements are met. Straight-line attribution is used because there is no other discernible pattern of use that suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
The Company’s Smart Grid Solutions Group sells hardware products directly to utilities for use and deployment by the utility. The Company recognizes revenue for such sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured consistent with the guidance of SAB No. 104. These sales are not multiple element arrangements and require no ongoing obligation.

In addition, our Smart Grid Solutions Group provides installation services under a long-term service contract with one of our customers. The Company recognizes revenue for such sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured consistent with the guidance of SAB No. 104.
In accordance with EITF No. 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the Company reports shipping and handling revenues and their associated costs in revenue and cost of revenue, respectively.
In accordance with EITF No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products), the Company records incentive payments made to participants in its VPC programs as cost of revenue.

The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue from products and services that it supplies to electricity providers such as utilities and independent service operators. Changes in economic conditions and unforeseen events could occur and reduce consumers’ use of electricity. The Company’s business success depends in part on its relationships with a limited number of large customers. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company had two customers which accounted for 16% and 12% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from these customers were $256 and $129, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company had three customers which accounted for 20%, 16% and 13% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from these customers were $325, $1,443 and $261, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had two customers which accounted for 28% and 16% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from these customers were $1,684 and $1,341, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue in 2004, 2005 and 2006.
The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments by placing its cash and cash equivalents with multiple domestic financial institutions.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $2,816, $3,709 and $3,544 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Substantially all advertising costs were incurred to promote the Company’s VPC programs to participants in an effort to acquire electric capacity in fulfillment of certain long-term capacity contracts with utility customers of the Company’s Alternative Energy Resources Group.
Internal Use Software
Software development costs of $59 and $12 were capitalized in 2005 and 2006, respectively, in accordance with SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and will be amortized over a three-year expected life in accordance with Company policy.
Software Development Costs
Software development costs have been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Under this standard, capitalization of software

development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and ends when the software is generally available. Based upon the Company’s product development process, technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of the related products has been short and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have not been material. Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs. All software development costs are a component of research and development expense.
Research and Development Expenses
All research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of salaries and benefits.
Stock-Based Compensation
On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the Company’s previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB No. 107, Share-Based Payment, relating to SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has applied applicable provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, the first day of its year ending December 31, 2006. The Company’s consolidated financial statements, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with this transition method, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include the impact of, SFAS No. 123(R).
The stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 was $0 and $30, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for the year December 31, 2006 was $252, before income taxes. The Company used the minimum-value method of measuring the fair value of share based payments granted prior to January 1, 2006. Upon adopting SFAS No. 123(R), for awards with service conditions and graded-vesting, a one-time election was made to recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
Because the Company utilized the minimum value method for pro forma disclosure purposes under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, disclosures to demonstrate the effect of pro forma compensation cost on net loss and net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 are not appropriate in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R).
The Company accounts for stock issued to consultants on a fair value basis in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) and EITF No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.
Segment Reporting
The Company has determined that it operates in two operating segments: the Smart Grid Solutions Group and the Alternative Energy Resources Group. Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Company in deciding how to allocate

resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker assesses the Company’s performance and allocates the Company’s resources based on two operating segments. These segments constitute the Company’s two reportable segments.
Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related assets or liabilities for financial reporting, or according to the expected reversal dates of the specific temporary differences, if not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized.
Income taxes associated with the undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are provided for in accordance with APB No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes—Special Areas, when the Company has sufficient evidence that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely. If it is determined that the undistributed earnings of a subsidiary will be remitted in the foreseeable future, all taxes related to the remittance of such undistributed earnings are provided for in the current period as income tax expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and the Company will adopt it in the first quarter of 2007. The Company believes that FIN No. 48 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) released SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements by Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. Prior practice allowed the evaluation of materiality on the basis of (1) the error quantified as the amount by which the current year income statement was misstated (rollover method) or (2) the cumulative error quantified as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet was misstated (iron curtain method). Reliance on either method in prior years could have resulted in misstatement of the financial statements. The guidance provided in SAB No. 108 requires both methods to be used in evaluating materiality. Immaterial prior year errors may be corrected with the first filling of prior year financial statements after adoption. The cumulative effect of the correction would be reflected in the opening balance sheet with appropriate disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error corrected in the cumulative adjustment, as well as a disclosure of the cause of the error and that the error had been deemed to be immaterial in the past. The Company believes that SAB No. 108 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements. SFAS No. 157

does not expand the use of fair value measures in financial statements, but standardizes its definition and guidance in GAAP. The Standard emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and not an entity-specific measurement based on an exchange transaction in which the entity sells an asset or transfers a liability (exit price). SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest level to fair value based on an entity’s own fair value assumptions as the lowest level. SFAS No. 157 is to be effective for the Company’s financial statements issued in 2008. The Company believes that SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—An Amendment of FASB No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”. SFAS No. 158 requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the company’s balance sheet, and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income, effective fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The standard also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year-end, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company believes that SFAS No. 158 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
 
2.	 	Net Loss Per Share
Net loss per share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, when dilutive, potential common shares from options and warrants using the treasury stock method, and from convertible securities using the if-converted method. Because the Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, all potential common shares have been excluded from the computation of the dilutive net loss per share for all periods presented because the effect would have been antidilutive. Such potential common shares consist of the following:

10.	 	Liability for Employee Termination Benefits
Under Israeli law and labor agreements, one of the Company’s subsidiaries, Comverge Control Systems Ltd., is required to make severance and pension payments to dismissed employees and to employees leaving employment in certain other circumstances. The obligation for severance pay benefits, as determined by the Israeli Severance Pay Law, is based upon length of service and last salary. These obligations are substantially covered by regular deposits with recognized severance pay and pension funds and by the purchase of insurance policies. The pension plans are multi-employer and independent of the Company. Pension and severance costs for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $143, $89 and $45, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses.
On December 27, 2005, the Company notified the employees of its subsidiary of its intent to close the Israel office of such subsidiary effective June 30, 2006. In June 2006, the Company modified this plan and instead decided to reduce the headcount in the Israel office but maintain a modest personnel presence. The significant headcount reductions contemplated as part of the modified plan were completed as of June 30, 2006. The remaining headcount is being maintained to support the intellectual property developed in Israel. Accordingly, included in accrued expenses is the Company’s liability for employee termination benefits of $580 and $379 as of December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
 
11.	 	Long-Term Debt
The Company maintains a senior credit facility (“senior loan agreement”) with a United States commercial bank. On September 24, 2004, the Company modified the senior loan agreement to (i) increase the revolving line of credit amount to $7,000, (ii) increase the letter of credit sublimit to $3,000 and (iii) extend the maturity date of the senior loan agreement to September 15, 2007. On October 25, 2005, the Company amended the senior loan agreement to include in the definition of eligible receivables certain amounts owing but not yet invoiced to account debtors. The senior loan agreement, as amended, bears interest at either prime plus 2.0 percent or prime plus 2.75 percent per annum, depending on the Company’s performance under a financial covenant contained in the agreement. Interest of $39 was paid on the senior loan agreement for the year ended December 31, 2006. The senior loan agreement is collateralized by virtually all of the assets of the Company including the Company’s intellectual property. Borrowings under the senior loan agreement can be requested, from time to time, up to an amount that, based on a formula, includes (i) up to 80 percent of eligible receivables and (ii) eligible inventory limited to the lesser of (A) 25 percent of fair market value, (B) 80 percent of net orderly liquidation value, (C) $500 or (D) 25% of the aggregate eligible accounts receivable outstanding. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had borrowings under the senior loan agreement of $1,000 and borrowing availability under the senior loan agreement of approximately $3,800. As more fully discussed in Note 18, the Company amended the senior loan agreement. Accordingly, the $1,000 outstanding is classified as long-term as of December 31, 2006.
On June 10, 2005, the Company entered into a $4,000 subordinated convertible debt agreement (“Convertible Debt”) with a U.S.-based lender with a maturity date of June 2010. The Convertible Debt bears interest at three percent plus the three-month LIBOR rate. The Convertible Debt requires payment of interest only provided that the Company meets or exceeds certain pro forma revenue targets calculated on a quarterly basis during the term. If the Company does not meet or exceed such revenue targets, at the option of the lender, the Convertible Debt will amortize ratably over a two-year period or such lesser period as remains until the maturity date. No principal payments have been required to date and none are expected to be paid during 2007. The lender may convert the principal amount of the loan into the Company’s Series B convertible preferred stock at a price of $7.24 per share at any time during its term. The Company may convert the principal amount of the loan under the same terms upon an offering of the Company’s common stock at an offering price of at least $14.00 per share and for which

the Company receives at least $30,000 of gross cash proceeds. The principal amount of the Convertible Debt may be prepaid at any time, provided that the payment must include an amount calculated to compensate the lender for interest that would have been paid through the maturity date of the Convertible Debt, determined by multiplying the principal balance by the current interest rate for each interest paying period from the prepayment date to the maturity date and then discounting the results to the repayment date at an annual rate of 20%. In addition, in the event of a prepayment of the principal amount, the lender has been provided a non-detachable warrant to purchase 551,693 shares of the Company’s Series B convertible preferred stock at a price of $7.24 per share. The Convertible Debt is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and is subordinated in right of payment to the senior loan agreement.
Long-term debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 consisted of the following:
 
 	  	2005	  	2006
Senior loan agreement with a U.S. bank, collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s assets, maturing in March 2008 (Note 18), interest payable at a variable rate (10.25% as of December 31, 2006)

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had a net deferred tax liability of $46 related to tax deductible goodwill amortization associated with indefinite lived assets. As a result, the Company recorded deferred tax expense of $46 for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had provided a valuation allowance of $13,169 on its net deferred tax assets before the deferred tax liability related to tax deductible goodwill because the realization of any future tax benefit cannot be sufficiently assured. A certain portion of the valuation allowance relates to stock-based compensation. If a tax benefit is subsequently recognized, this portion will be recorded in additional paid-in-capital. Subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2006 will be allocated as follows:
 
Income tax benefit that would be reported in the consolidated statement of income

  	$	 12,985
Additional paid-in capital

  	 	184
  	 	 
  	$	13,169
  	 	 
SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the Company to calculate the pool of income tax benefits that were previously recorded in additional paid-in-capital and are available to absorb future income tax shortfalls that can result from the exercise or maturity of stock awards. The Company has calculated its windfall pool under the short-cut method based on the actual income tax benefits received from exercises and maturities of stock awards granted after December 31, 2005.
The Company had federal, state and foreign net operating losses of approximately $32,845, $23,671 and $3,121, respectively, at December 31, 2006. The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in 2019, and state net operating loss carryforwards began expiring in 2006. The utilization of some of the net operating losses are subject to Internal Revenue Code section 382 limitations due to prior ownership changes.

Supply Agreement
In May 2006, the Company negotiated a supply agreement with an electric utility in southwest Connecticut that had previously secured contracts with certain of its large commercial and industrial customers to provide electric capacity by permitting direct load control of certain devices and equipment located in their operating facilities. The Company contributed this capacity as a demand response resource under one of its VPC contracts. The Company has a contractual commitment to make additional payments to the electric utility totaling $2.0 million under the two-year term of the agreement. Such amounts will be included in the Company’s cost of revenue. As of December 31, 2006, the Company owes $1,536, which is recorded within accrued expenses.

The term of the supply agreement is co-terminus with the related VPC contract. If the VPC contract terminates, the supply agreement will also terminate. If the supply agreement terminates in advance of the termination or expiration of the VPC contract, no assurance can be given that the Company would be able to obtain alternative electric capacity in the future at favorable prices, or at all, and the unavailability of electric capacity, or a material increase in the price of such electric capacity would have an unfavorable impact on operating income and cash flows from operations.
Employee Retirement Savings Plan
The Company sponsors a tax deferred retirement savings plan that permits eligible U.S. employees to contribute varying percentages of their compensation up to the limit allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. This plan also provides for discretionary Company contributions. No discretionary contributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 or 2006.
Royalties
The Company’s subsidiary, Comverge Control Systems Ltd., is obligated to pay royalties to the Government of Israel on proceeds from the sale of certain products that incorporate intellectual property developed in whole or in part through grants from the Chief Scientist of the State of Israel (“Chief Scientist”). Royalties are payable at a rate of 4.5 percent of the annual sales of such products. Royalties payable under this arrangement are not to exceed the original amount of the grants, which was $595. As of December 31, 2006, the maximum amount payable on the future sale of products, if any, was approximately $386.
Guarantees
The Company typically grants customers a limited warranty that guarantees that its products will substantially conform to its current specifications for 90 days related to software products and one year related to hardware products from the delivery date. The Company also indemnifies its customers from third-party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to the intended use of its products. Standard software license agreements contain indemnification clauses that are limited in amount. Pursuant to these clauses, the Company indemnifies and agrees to pay any judgment or settlement relating to a claim. The Company accounts for these clauses under FASB Staff Position FIN No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others—an Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. There were no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2005 and 2006.
The Company has guaranteed the electrical capacity it has committed to deliver pursuant to certain long-term contracts of its Alternative Energy Resources Group. Such guarantees may be secured by cash, letters of credit, performance bonds or third-party guarantees. Performance guarantees paid during the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 were $80 and $0, respectively.

The conversion price is also subject to proportional adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar transactions.

Stock Warrants
In June 2005, in conjunction with the Convertible Debt financing, the Company issued a warrant to the lender to purchase 551,693 shares of Series B Preferred for $7.24 per share. The warrant is exercisable only if the Company prepays the principal amount of the Convertible Debt. As a result, the warrant is not detachable from the Convertible Debt. In accordance with APB No. 14, Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants, the securities are substantially equivalent and not accounted for separately. The warrant will expire in June 2010 or earlier upon the conversion of any portion of the principal amount of the Convertible Debt into shares of the Company.
In February 2006, a significant investor in the Series C Preferred entered into a strategic marketing and development agreement with the Company (“Agreement”). As part of the Agreement, the investor was given a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of Series C Preferred for $15.00 per share. The warrant is exercisable only if the investor meets defined performance milestones. Since there are no disincentives for nonperformance for the investor, in accordance with EITF No. 96-18, the warrant is not measured until such time as performance is complete. The performance milestones have not been attained. Accordingly, the Company has recorded no amounts related to the warrant as of December 31, 2006. The warrant expires upon the earliest of a public offering of the Company’s securities, August 12, 2008 or upon a change of control (as defined in the warrant).

The Company utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value, utilizing the following assumptions for the respective years (weighted averages based on grants during the period):
 
 	  	2006	 
Risk-free interest rate

  	4.63	%
Expected term of options, in years

  	4.5	 
Expected annual volatility

  	90.0	%
Expected dividend yield

  	0.0	%
Volatility measures the amount that a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period. The Company determines volatility based on an analysis of comparable public companies. The risk-free interest rate is the rate available as of the option date on zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. Because we do not have a sufficient history to estimate the expected term, the Company uses SAB No. 107’s simplified method for estimating expected term. The simplified method is based on vesting-tranches and the contractual life of each grant. The Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company estimates its forfeiture rate of unvested stock awards based on historical experience since 2003.
During 2005, the Company granted 125,000 shares of restricted common stock to two senior executives. The shares were fully vested at the date of grant. The shares are subject to certain rights of first refusal granted to the Company and accordingly may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of except in conformity with the terms of the stock agreement. The fair value of the shares on the date of issuance was determined to be $92. The Company recorded compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of grant in conjunction with the issuance.

16.	 	Segment Information
The Company has two operating segments: the Alternative Energy Resources Group and the Smart Grid Solutions Group. The Smart Grid Solutions Group sells hardware, software and installation services to utilities that elect to own and operate such demand response networks for their own benefit. The Alternative Energy Resources Group sells electric capacity to utilities on an outsourced basis under long-term contracts. The Alternative Energy Resources Group accomplishes this by developing, owning, and managing a demand response network on behalf of the utility. Management has three primary measures of segment performance: revenue, gross profit (margin) and operating income. The Alternative Energy Resources Group purchases demand response hardware and software from the Smart Grid Solutions Group. All inter-operating segment revenues are eliminated in consolidation. Smart Grid Solutions Group product hardware and software cost of revenue include materials, labor and overhead. Within the Alternative Energy Resources Group, cost of revenue is based on operating costs, primarily telecommunications costs related to the network, and depreciation of the assets capitalized in building the demand response network. Operating expenses directly associated with each operating segment include sales, marketing, product development and administrative expenses.
Corporate operating expenses, interest income, interest expense, other income (expense) and amortization expense are not allocated to the operating segments nor included in the measure of segment profit or loss. The Company does not allocate assets and liabilities to its operating segments. All depreciation expense was directly related to the operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006.
The operating results for the Company’s operating segments are as follows:

An affiliate of AFI charged the Company’s Israeli subsidiary, Comverge Control Systems Ltd., $138, $138 and $112, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006. Such charges were in consideration of providing office space and certain accounting and administrative services, which amounts are included in general and administrative expense. With the significant headcount reductions completed as of December 31, 2006, the Company is utilizing less office space and has renegotiated the cost sharing terms under which AFI provides such services, effective July 1, 2006.
A holder of the Company’s Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred representing over 5% of the Company’s voting shares supplies thermostats to the Company pursuant to a restated communicating thermostat co-development and supply agreement dated as of June 1, 2005. Pursuant to the agreement, such stockholder has agreed to develop one or more customized thermostats to be combined with the Company’s communication interfaces. The Company has agreed to pay such stockholder a specified amount for co-development expenses with respect to each customized thermostat model and a specified price for each unit produced.

In February 2006, a significant investor in the Series C Preferred entered into a strategic marketing and development agreement with the Company (“Agreement”). As part of the Agreement, the investor was given a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of Series C Preferred for $15.00 per share. The warrant is exercisable only if the investor meets defined performance milestones under the agreement as specified in the warrant. The warrant expires upon the earliest of a public offering of the Company’s securities, August 12, 2008 or upon a change of control (as defined in the warrant).
The lender of the Convertible Debt became a stockholder of the Company in March 2006 by investing in the Series C Preferred. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, the Company made interest payments on the Convertible Debt of $130 and $326, respectively, in addition to paying the lender an $80 placement fee in June 2005 related to the Convertible Debt.
 
18.	 	Subsequent Events
New Subsidiary Credit Facility
In January 2007, Alternative Energy Resources, Inc. (“AER”), a newly created wholly owned subsidiary of Comverge, Inc., entered into a senior debt agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (“GE Credit Facility”). The GE Credit Facility provides up to $40 million of borrowings to fund capital expenditures related to AER’s VPC contracts. The GE Credit Facility expires in 2014, at which time all outstanding borrowings will become due and payable. Subject to the limitations described below, the GE Credit Facility has a term loan facility up to $37.0 million and a letter of credit facility up to $3.0 million. Borrowings under the GE Credit Facility bear interest at either prime plus 1.5% or LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum, at the Company’s election. The GE Credit Facility is collateralized by all of AER’s assets, including its intellectual property. Borrowings under the GE Credit Facility can be requested, from time to time during the first three years of the agreement, up to an amount that includes 90% of capital expenditures incurred under a VPC contract. The GE Credit Facility contains customary financial and restrictive covenants, including maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio and a prohibition on the payment of dividends. The Company paid $171 in debt issuance cost related to this facility during 2006.
In conjunction with entering into the GE Credit Facility, we entered into an amendment with the senior lender to the senior loan agreement. The amendment modified certain terms and conditions of the senior loan agreement, including (i) a release of the lien on all assets of AER, (ii) extending the maturity date of the senior loan agreement from September 15, 2007 to March 15, 2008, (iii) reducing the facility amount from $7.0 million to $4.0 million, and (iv) reducing the quick ratio financial covenant from 1.25 times to 0.75 times until the earlier of an initial public offering or April 15, 2007.
In conjunction with entering into the GE Credit Facility, the Company entered into an agreement with the lender under the Convertible Debt. As part of the agreement, the Company has agreed to allow the lender the right, through the date of an initial public offering with an offering price of not less than $14.00 and in which gross proceeds to the Company are at least $30,000, to request mandatory prepayments of subordinated debt principal in the ratio of 25% for every $1 of debt drawn under the GE Credit Facility, exclusive of debt incurred to fund transaction costs to complete the GE Credit Facility. If the lender were to receive a mandatory prepayment of debt pursuant to the agreement, the Company would not be required to pay the interest prepayment penalty identified in the Convertible Debt agreement but would still be required to issue the non-detachable warrant related to the applicable number of shares. The lender entered into an intercreditor and subordination agreement with the lender of the GE Credit Facility whereby the lender of the Convertible Debt agreed to subordinate its liens against AER assets to the liens of the lender of the GE Credit Facility.

ENERWISE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
 
1.	 	Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiary (collectively, “Enerwise” or the “Company”) provides demand response and energy infrastructure management services for commercial, institutional, and industrial customers, enabling customers to reduce energy costs, comply with increasingly demanding environmental regulations, take advantage of alternative power initiatives and increase operational security.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of its subsidiary. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position at June 30, 2007, and the results of operations and cash flows for the six month periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2007. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2007 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Comprehensive Income
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. There was no difference between the Company’s net loss and its total comprehensive loss for the six month periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2007, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Demand Response
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenues when the following criteria have been met: delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, collection is probable, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Where final acceptance of the deliverable is specified by the customer, the Company defers corresponding revenue until all acceptance criteria have been met.
The Company enters into agreements to provide demand response and capacity event services. The demand response contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility end customers when the utility calls a demand response event to curtail electric usage. Demand response revenues are earned based on the Company’s ability to deliver capacity. In order to provide capacity, the Company manages a

portfolio of commercial and industrial end users’ load. Capacity amounts are verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a customer initiated demand response test. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company recognizes revenue and associated cost of revenue in its demand response services at such time as the capacity amount is fixed and determinable.
Capacity event services revenue is contingent revenue earned based upon actual amount of energy provided during the capacity event. Contingent revenue from capacity events are recognized when the capacity amount is fixed and determinable. Capacity event revenue is deemed to be substantive and represents a culmination of a separate earnings process, and is recognized when the capacity event is initiated by the customer.
Services
Revenue from time-and-materials service contracts and other services are recognized as services are provided. Revenues from certain fixed price contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis, which involves the use of estimates. If the Company does not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion, revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when final acceptance is received from the customer.
The Company enters into agreements to provide hosting services. Revenue from hosting contracts is recognized as the services are provided, generally on a recurring monthly basis.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with a high-quality financial institution, and consequently, such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. Credit risk arising from receivables is minimal due to the large number of clients comprising the Company’s customer base and their dispersion across various industries. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had one customer which accounted for 28% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from this customer was $834 as of December 31, 2006. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue in 2006. During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company had one customer which accounted for 63% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from this customer was $1,518 as of June 30, 2007. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2006 or 2007.
The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments by placing its cash and cash equivalents with a number of domestic financial institutions and by investing in investment grade securities.
Stock-Based Compensation
On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the Company’s previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, the first day of its year ending December 31, 2006. The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with this transition method, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include the impact of, SFAS No. 123(R).

There was no stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for the six months ended June 30, 2006. Stock-based compensation was $84 for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements. SFAS No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value measures in financial statements, but standardizes its definition and guidance in GAAP. The Standard emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and not an entity-specific measurement based on an exchange transaction in which the entity sells an asset or transfers a liability (exit price). SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest level to fair value based on an entity’s own fair value assumptions as the lowest level. SFAS No. 157 is to be effective for the Company’s financial statements issued in 2008. The Company believes that SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN 48”), an interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (“SFAS 109”). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. The Company must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS 109. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not record any unrecognized tax positions as of January 1, 2007 or June 30, 2007.

Acquisition of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc by Comverge, Inc.
On July 23, 2007, Comverge Inc. (“Comverge”) completed its acquisition of Enerwise. Enerwise merged with and into Comverge Eagle, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Comverge Inc., pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“the Enerwise Agreement”) dated as of June 27, 2007. Comverge provides (i) Smart Grid solutions to electric utilities and other energy providers consisting of demand response systems comprised of hardware, software and installation services, and (ii) Alternative Energy Resources through which electric capacity is provided to its utility customers during periods of peak energy demand. Pursuant to the terms of the Enerwise Agreement, the Enerwise securityholders received the following consideration of approximately $79.1 million, which excludes the value of 191,183 shares of Comverge common shares issued into escrow (the “Escrow Shares”):
 
 	•	 	
$25.2 million in cash;

 
 	•	 	
1,279,545 shares of our common stock, valued at $36.9 million; and

 
 	•	 	
subordinated convertible promissory notes in the original aggregate principal amount of $17.0 million that are convertible into an aggregate of up to 508,449 shares of Comverge common stock.

Pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement, the Escrow Shares will only be earned by the Enerwise stockholders and released only upon the achievement by the business unit that represents the acquired business of

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiary:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 2005 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has restated its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005, previously audited by other independent accountants.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
 
1.	Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiary (collectively, “Enerwise” or the “Company”) provides demand response and energy infrastructure management services for commercial, institutional, and industrial customers, enabling customers to reduce energy costs, comply with environmental regulations, take advantage of alternative power initiatives and increase operational security.
In 1980, the Company was founded under the name Multi-Test Maintenance Corporation (“Multi-Test”). In 1997, Multi-Test was acquired by Delmarva Power and renamed Power Consulting Group. In 2001, the Power Consulting Group business was divested to EnerTech Capital. After the divestiture was completed, the Company was renamed Enerwise Global Technologies, Inc.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of its subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All entries required for the fair presentation of the financial statements are of a normal recurring nature. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include management’s estimate of provisions required for non-collectible accounts receivable and the valuation of its common stock. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comprehensive Income
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. There was no difference between the Company’s net loss and its total comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and demand deposits in banks and short-term investments.
The Company is required to maintain a compensating balance with a financial institution as collateral towards the credit cards issued in the name of the Company. These deposits are restricted and, accordingly, the amount has been classified as restricted cash on the balance sheets.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of accounts considered to be doubtful of collection as well as historical experience. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, there were $82 and $89, respectively, identified as doubtful of collection.
Accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance when the Company believes an account, or portion thereof, is no longer collectible.

(in thousands, except share and per share data)
 
Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. When the property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss recognized in current operations.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles, net
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identified intangible assets of businesses acquired in purchase transactions. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not being amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, on December 31 of each year. Based on the Company’s most recent impairment test completed as of December 31, 2006, there has been no impairment loss recognized for goodwill.
The costs of acquired contracts are presented at their fair value at acquisition date. The Company amortizes acquired contracts over the estimated useful life of each contract using the straight-line method, which approximates the expected life of each contract. The amortization expense related to acquired contracts are recorded in the general and administrative expense line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets. If such evaluation indicates a potential impairment, a discounted cash flow analysis is used to measure fair value in determining the amount of these assets that should be written off.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values reported for cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their respective fair values at each balance sheet date due to the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
Revenue Recognition
Demand Response
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenues when the following criteria have been met: delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, collection is probable, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Where final acceptance of the deliverable is specified by the customer, the Company defers corresponding revenue until all acceptance criteria have been met.
The Company enters into agreements to provide demand response and capacity event services. The demand response contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility end customers when the utility calls a demand response event to curtain electrical usage. Demand response revenues
 
F-65
Table of Contents

ENERWISE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
 
are earned based on the Company’s ability to deliver capacity. In order to provide capacity, the Company manages a portfolio of commercial and industrial end users’ loads. Capacity amounts are verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a customer initiated demand response test. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company recognizes revenue and associated cost of revenue in its demand response services at such time as the capacity amount is fixed and determinable.
Capacity event services revenue is contingent revenue earned based upon actual amount of energy provided during the capacity event. Contingent revenue from capacity events are recognized when the capacity amount is fixed and determinable. Capacity event services revenue is deemed to be substantive and represents a culmination of a separate earnings process, and is recognized when the capacity event is initiated by the customer.
Services
Revenue from time-and-materials service contracts and other services are recognized as services are provided. Revenues from certain fixed price contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis, which involves the use of estimates. If the Company does not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion, revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when final acceptance is received from the customer.
The Company enters into agreements to provide hosting services that allow customers to monitor and analyze their electrical usage. Revenue from hosting contracts is recognized as the services are provided, generally on a recurring monthly basis.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with a high-quality financial institution, and consequently, such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. Credit risk arising from receivables is minimal due to the large number of clients comprising the Company’s customer base and their dispersion across various industries. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company had two customers which accounted for 16% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues. The total accounts receivable from these customers were $227 and $138, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had one customer which accounted for 28% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from this customer was $834 as of December 31, 2006. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue in 2005 and 2006.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006.
Stock-Based Compensation
On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the Company’s previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company’s stock-based employee compensation plan is described more fully in Note 12.

ENERWISE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
 
The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard for all new stock-award grants as of January 1, 2006, the first day of its year ending December 31, 2006. The Company’s consolidated financial statements, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with this transition method, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include the impact of, SFAS No. 123(R).
There was no stock-based compensation expense recognized under APB No. 25 or SFAS No. 123(R) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Because the Company utilized the minimum value method for pro forma disclosure purposes under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, disclosures to demonstrate the effect of pro forma compensation cost on net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 are not appropriate in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R).
Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related assets or liabilities for financial reporting, or according to the expected reversal dates of the specific temporary differences, if not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN 48”). This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and the Company will adopt it in the first quarter of 2007. FIN 48 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements. SFAS No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value measures in financial statements, but standardizes its definition and guidance in GAAP. The Standard emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and not an entity-specific measurement based on an exchange transaction in which the entity sells an asset or transfers a liability (exit price). SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest level to fair value based on an entity’s own fair value assumptions as the lowest level. SFAS No. 157 is to be effective for the Company’s financial statements issued in 2008. The Company believes that SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
 
2.	Restatement of 2005 Financial Statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 have been restated from those previously issued to correct the accounting for the following:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
 
Revenue Recognition
(1) The Company re-assessed its accounting for certain professional service contracts. Upon completion of such evaluation, it was determined that the percentage of completion calculation used to record revenue should be based on an input method utilizing labor hours rather than costs. The correction of the error results in an increase of revenue of $716 and cost of revenue of $667 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
(2) The Company re-evaluated its accounting for certain demand response transactions and its determination of when the sales price is considered fixed and determinable. Upon completion of such assessment, it was determined that the sales price of certain electric capacity events is considered fixed and determinable at the time that the capacity results are known and communicated to the customers, rather than as of the electric capacity event date. The correction of the error results in a decrease of revenue of $213 and cost of revenue of $171 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Income Taxes
In connection with the preparation of its December 31, 2006 financial statements, the Company identified certain errors related to income taxes. The errors related to the omission of a deferred tax liability for tax deductible goodwill amortization associated with indefinite lived assets. The correction of the error results in an increase of net loss of $69 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Other
The Company identified certain errors related to accrued liabilities. The correction of these errors results in an increase of general and administrative expenses of $7 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
During 2005, the Company changed the classification of certain costs of revenue to general and administrative expenses. The revision resulted in a decrease in cost of revenue and a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses of $624. There was no impact on net loss, financial position, or cash flows related to this revision.
Accordingly, the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005, and the December 31, 2004 balances in the Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Deficit have been restated to reflect the correction of these errors as follows. There was no impact on cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities.

10.	Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
On August 26, 2004, the Company completed a financing in which all previously outstanding Redeemable Convertible Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) was converted to common stock; 21,587,658 shares of Redeemable Convertible Series C Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred”) were issued through the sale of $1,141 of Series C Preferred to various investors and the conversion of $3,680 of convertible notes and 2,092,581 shares of Redeemable Convertible Series B Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred”) were issued through the conversion of $1,105 of convertible notes.

The initial conversion price of the Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred is $0.5281 and $0.2233 respectively, and is subject to adjustment in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions contained in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. All outstanding Preferred Stock is automatically converted to common upon an affirmative vote of two thirds of the holders of the then outstanding Series C Preferred or immediately prior to the closing of as firm commitment, underwritten public offering in which the public offering price equals or exceeds four times the Series C Preferred purchase price of $0.2233 per share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, splits or recapitalization) and the aggregate proceeds raised exceed $15,000,000.

Liquidation Preference
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, the holders of the then outstanding Series C Preferred are entitled to receive, in preference and priority to any payments to holders of other securities, an amount per share equal to the sum of $0.2233 per share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, plus an amount per share equal to $1,000 divided by the number of shares of Series C Preferred then outstanding.
If additional funds are available, the holders of the Series C Preferred and participants in the Company’s employee retention plan will share such funds, in preference and priority to any payments to holders of other securities, in the ratio of 84.2% and 15.8% respectively. Payments will be made until the holders of the then outstanding Series C Preferred receive per share compensation equal to four times the initial purchase price plus any accrued but unpaid dividends.
If additional funds are available, the holders of the Series B Preferred and participants in the Corporation’s employee retention plan will share such funds, in preference and priority to any payments to holders of other securities, in the ratio of 84.2% and 15.8% respectively. Payments will be made until the holders of the then outstanding Series B Preferred receive Per share compensation equal to one times the Series B Purchase Price of $0.5281 per share.

Agreement, the Enerwise securityholders received the following consideration of approximately $79.1 million, which excludes the value of 191,183 shares of Comverge common shares issued into escrow (the “Escrow Shares”):
 
 	Ø	 	
$25.2 million in cash;

 
 	Ø	 	
1,279,545 shares of our common stock, valued at $36.9 million; and

 
 	Ø	 	
subordinated convertible promissory notes in the original aggregate principal amount of $17.0 million that are convertible into an aggregate of up to 508,373 shares of Comverge common stock.

Pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement, the Escrow Shares will only be earned by the Enerwise stockholders and released only upon the achievement by the business unit that represents the acquired business of Enerwise of at least $36.0 million in revenue for 2008 and at least $11 million of gross profit for 2008. If both of the foregoing metrics are not met, all of the Escrow Shares may at Comverge’s sole discretion be released to the Enerwise stockholders.
Enertech Capital and its related investment funds own 2,018,924 shares of Comverge common stock, which was approximately 11% of the outstanding shares before the completion of the Enerwise acquisition. Enertech Capital and its related investment funds also owned approximately 38% of the capital stock of Enerwise when it was acquired by Comverge.

NOTES TO COMBINED STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share data. All information as of and for the six months
ended June 30, 2006 and 2007 is unaudited.)
 
1.	Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Liquidity, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Public Energy Solutions, LLC, Public Electric, Inc. and PES NY, LLC are a group of related entities under common control. As such, these entities are presented as combined and treated as a single entity for financial reporting purposes (collectively, the “Company” or “Public Energy Solutions”). Public Electric, Inc. and PES NY, LLC are entities with no stand-alone operating activity outside the combined entities since inception.
The Company provides (i) electric capacity to its utility customers to reduce base load and (ii) energy infrastructure management to a portfolio of residential and commercial customers through lighting efficiencies and upgrades. These lighting upgrades allow customers to reduce energy costs.
Basis of Presentation
The combined financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the three related entities under common control. The combined financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All entries required for the fair presentation of the financial statements are of a normal recurring nature. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.
Liquidity
The Company had negative working capital and was in default of certain financial covenants related to its debt as of December 31, 2006. As further discussed in Note 11, the Company was acquired by Comverge on September 29, 2007. On October 1, 2007, the Company’s outstanding debt balance was paid in full.
Unaudited Interim Combined Financial Statements
Data and information as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2007 are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim combined financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for this period.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comprehensive Income
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. There was no difference between the Company’s net loss and its total comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2007.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and demand deposits in banks.

(in thousands, except share data. All information as of and for the six months
ended June 30, 2006 and 2007 is unaudited.)
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of accounts considered to be doubtful of collection as well as historical experience. As of December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007, there were $8 and $0, respectively, identified as doubtful of collection.
Accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance when the Company believes an account, or portion thereof, is no longer collectible.
Inventory
Inventories are primarily comprised of purchased lighting equipment and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory cost is determined on the basis of specific identification based on acquisition cost, and due provision is made to reduce all slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories to their estimated useful or scrap values. As of December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007, there were no inventories identified as slow-moving, obsolete or unusable.
Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. When the property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss recognized in current operations.
Intangible Assets, net
Intangible assets represent an acquired contract which is presented at fair value at acquisition date. The Company amortizes acquired contracts over the estimated useful life of each contract using the straight-line method, which approximates the expected life of each contract. The amortization expense related to acquired contracts are recorded in the general and administrative expense line item in the combined statement of operations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets. If such evaluation indicates a potential impairment, a discounted cash flow analysis is used to measure fair value in determining the amount of these assets that should be written off.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values reported for cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their respective fair values at each balance sheet date due to the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenues when the following criteria have been met: delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable,

collection is probable, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Where final acceptance of the deliverable is specified by the customer, the Company defers corresponding revenue until all acceptance criteria have been met.
The Company enters into agreements to provide demand electric load reduction services to utilities or commercial and industrial end customers. Electric load reduction revenues are earned based on the Company’s ability to achieve committed capacity through load reduction. In order to provide capacity, the Company delivers and installs demand side management measures to a portfolio of commercial and industrial end customers. The electric load reduction contracts require the Company to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers, and include a measurement and verification of such capacity in order to determine contract consideration. In accordance with SAB 104, the Company recognizes revenue and associated cost of revenue in its electric load reduction services at such time as the capacity amount is fixed and determinable. If the revenue is subject to penalty, refund or an ongoing obligation, the revenue is deferred until the contingency is resolved and/or the Company has met its performance obligation. As of December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007, the Company has long-term deferred revenue of $2,486 and $2,942 due to unresolved contingencies.
Revenue from time-and-materials service contracts are recognized as services are provided. Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.
Certain contracts are accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF No. 00-21 requires that the Company assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting. The separate deliverables in these arrangements meet the separation criteria. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each element by applying the residual method under EITF No. 00-21 since there is objective evidence of fair value of only the undelivered item. The amount allocated to the delivered item is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of the additional element.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with a high-quality financial institution, and consequently, such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue from services that it provides to electricity providers such as utilities and commercial and industrial end customers. Changes in economic conditions and unforeseen events could occur and reduce consumers’ use of electricity. The Company ‘s business success depends in part on its relationships with a limited number of large customers. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had one customer which accounted for 75% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from this customer was $667 as of December 31, 2006. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue in 2006. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company had one customer which accounted for 83% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from this customer was $1,604 at June 30, 2006. During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company had one customer which accounted for 94% of the Company’s total revenue. The total accounts receivable from this customer was $1,270 as of June 30, 2007. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2006 or 2007.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $136 for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $84 and $119 for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Income Taxes
The two limited liability companies, with the consent of its members, have elected under the Internal Revenue Code to be taxed as a partnership. Accordingly, income is allocated to the members for inclusion in their tax returns and no provision or liability for federal and state income taxes has been included in the combined financial statements. Public Electric, Inc. is a C corporation. The sole tax attribute of the C corporation is an immaterial net operating loss carryforward. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the net operating loss carryforward since the realization of any future tax benefit cannot be sufficiently assured.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements. SFAS No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value measures in financial statements, but standardizes its definition and guidance in GAAP. The Standard emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and not an entity-specific measurement based on an exchange transaction in which the entity sells an asset or transfers a liability (exit price). SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest level to fair value based on an entity’s own fair value assumptions as the lowest level. SFAS No. 157 is to be effective for the Company’s financial statements issued in 2008. The Company believes that SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on its combined financial statements.
 
2.	Restatement of interim combined financial statements
The accompanying combined financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2007 have been restated from those previously issued to correct the accounting for certain contractual commitments related to installation requirements for a service agreement. The Company re-evaluated its accounting for certain contractual commitments as of June 30, 2006 and 2007. Upon completion of such evaluation, it was determined that certain payments needed to be accrued at each of the interim periods. The correction of the error results in an increase to net loss of $751 and $208 as of June 30, 2006 and 2007, respectively.
Accordingly, the Combined Statements of Operations for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2007, the Combined Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2007, the June 30, 2007 balance in the Combined Statement of Changes in Members’ Capital, and the Combined Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2007 have been restated to reflect the correction of the error as follows.

3.	Acquisition
The Company purchased a wholly owned subsidiary of an energy service company on October 28, 2005. The total purchase price was $1,050 which was paid in 2006. The source of funds for the acquisition of this energy service company subsidiary was comprised of $350 of cash and $700 of proceeds from debt.
The Company allocated the purchase price to the tangible asset and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair values. The intangible asset was identified as a customer contract with a finite useful life. There was no excess purchase price over net assets, thus no goodwill was recorded. The fair value assigned to the intangible asset was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. The purchased intangible asset has a finite life and is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life. The total purchase price has been allocated as follows:

On April 10, 2006, the Company entered into a senior debt agreement (“senior debt agreement”) with a United States commercial bank. The senior debt agreement is collateralized by virtually all of the assets of the Company as well as certain assets of its members. The senior debt agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of $700 (“line of credit”), a term loan of $700 (“first term loan”), and an additional term loan of $549 (“second term loan”). The senior debt agreement contains customary financial and restrictive covenants, including maintenance of a minimum debt service coverage ratio, a minimum current ratio, and a minimum leverage ratio. The senior debt agreement also prohibits capital distributions to members.
The line of credit was entered into to provide the Company with short-term working capital needs. The line of credit bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1% for outstanding balances. The interest rate at December 31, 2006 was 9.25%. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowing availability under the line of credit. In 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to extend the line of credit to $950. As of June 30, 2007 the Company had borrowing availability of $100.
 
The TD Banknorth Capital Expenditure line of credit was entered into to provide the Company with funds primarily for the acquisition of equipment. The line of credit bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1% for outstanding balances. As of June 30, 2007, the Company had $198 of borrowing availability under the line of credit.
The first term loan was entered into to provide the funds for the acquisition completed during 2005. The term loan is due and payable on April 1, 2008. The Company makes equal monthly payments on the term loan of $29 plus interest. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1%. The interest rate at December 31, 2006 was 9.25%. The Company may prepay the term loan with no penalty.
The second term loan is due and payable on November 1, 2008. The Company makes equal monthly payments on the term loan of $11 plus interest for the period May 1, 2006 through April 1, 2008. For the period May 1, 2008 through November 1, 2008, the Company will make monthly payments of $41 plus interest. The term loan bears interest at a fixed rate per annum of 8%. The Company will be assessed a prepayment penalty if it elects to prepay the term loan.
Upon entering into the senior debt agreement in April 2006, the Company paid the outstanding balance on an existing term loan and line of credit, both with a separate United States commercial bank. The payments

constitute an extinguishment of debt; however, no gain or loss was recognized as total payments equaled the outstanding balance.
The Company had $900 of irrevocable letters of credit available for issuance with another financial institution as of December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007.
The Company is in default of certain financial covenants as of December 31, 2006. Accordingly, all the outstanding debt is classified as current. All outstanding debt was repaid on October 1, 2007 as a condition of closing the acquisition of the Company by Comverge, Inc. (See Note 11).
 
9.	Members’ Capital
For the two limited liability companies, each member’s percentage interest is determined by the allocation specified in the operating agreement for the entities. Ownership is expressed in percentage interest rather than shares or units. There is no difference in class, rights, preferences, or privileges within the ownership percentages. Capital contributions historically have been made in cash. Additional contributions may be made by members, upon written consent of the manager, in order to provide additional funds for business purposes. The manager is defined as the person who directs, manages, and controls the business of the Company to the best of his or her ability. As specified in the operating agreements, no member is obligated personally for any debts, obligations, or liabilities of the entities or any other member.
The Company has one manager. In the event that a manager ceases to hold office, a new manager will be elected by the affirmative vote of members holding a majority of percentage interest. The manager may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of members holding a majority of the percentage interests. The manager receives compensation for his services as determined by members holding a majority of the percentage interests.
Net income (loss) is allocated to the members in proportion to their respective percentage interests. Distributions of net operating cash flow are made to the members at reasonable intervals, as determined by the manager, in accordance with their percentage interests. There were no distributions made to members during the year ended December 31, 2006, or the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2007.
Equity balances related to Public Electric, Inc. have been included in the combined statement of changes in members’ capital for presentation purposes. In addition to the 100 shares issued and outstanding for all periods presented, retained earnings of $30 as of December 31, 2005, and accumulated deficit of $36 and $29 as of December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007, respectively, is also included in the members’ capital balance for presentation purposes.
 
10.	Related Party Transactions
In accordance with the operating agreement for the limited liability companies, members may request and receive interest-bearing loans from the Company. There were no member loans outstanding as of December 31, 2006 or June 30, 2007.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, there was a loan payable to a member of $25. This liability is included in other current liabilities of the combined balance sheet and was repaid by the Company in full in 2007.

11.	Subsequent Events

Item 14.	 	Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
We are a Delaware corporation. Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware authorizes us to indemnity under certain circumstances current or former directors, officers employees or agents in connection with actions, suits or proceedings, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent, against expenses and liabilities actually and reasonably incurred in such actions, suits or proceedings so long as they acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonable believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the company, and with respect to any criminal action if they had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. With respect to suits by or in the right of such corporation, however, indemnification is generally limited to attorneys’ fees and other expenses actually and reasonably incurred and is not available if such person is adjudged to be liable to such corporation unless the court determines that indemnification is appropriate.
As permitted by Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of our directors to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:
 
 	•	 	
for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;

 
 	•	 	
for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

 
 	•	 	
under section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware regarding unlawful dividends and stock purchases; or

 
 	•	 	
for any transaction for which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

As permitted by Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation provides that we are required to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.
As permitted by Delaware law, our bylaws provide that:
 
 	•	 	
we may indemnify our other employees and agents, subject to very limited exceptions;

 
II-1
Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

 	•	 	
we are required to advance expenses (including without limitation, attorneys’ fees), as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with a legal proceeding, subject to very limited exceptions; and

 
 	•	 	
the rights conferred in our bylaws are not exclusive.

The indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of our directors and officers for liabilities arising under the Securities Act.
Under Delaware law, corporations also have the power to purchase and maintain insurance for directors, officers, employees and agents. Our bylaws empower the board of directors to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of our officers and directors. Prior to the closing of the offering, it is contemplated that Comverge and its subsidiaries will be covered by liability insurance policies which indemnify their directors and officers against loss arising from claims by reason of their legal liability for acts as such directors, officers, or trustees, subject to limitations and conditions as set forth in the policies.
The section of the prospectus entitled “Management—Indemnification Agreements” briefly discusses the terms of the indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and executive officers and is incorporated herein by reference.
The foregoing discussion of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements, and Delaware law is not intended to be exhaustive and is qualified in its entirety by such certificate of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements, or law.
Reference is made to Item 17 of our undertakings with respect to liabilities arising under the Securities Act. Reference is also made to the form of underwriting agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement for the indemnification agreements between us and the underwriters.

(b) Financial Statement Schedules.
Schedule II – Valuation and Qualifying Accounts is included on F-33. All other schedules for which provision is made in the applicable accounting regulations of the SEC are omitted because they are not required, are not applicable or the information is included in the financial statements or notes thereto.
 
Item 17.	 	Undertakings.
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item 14 above, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that:
(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this Registration Statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this Registration Statement as of the time it was declared effective; and
(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at the time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, if the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date that it is first used after effectiveness; provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of a registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or a prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:

(iii) the portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering, containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities, provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
