PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
 
This summary highlights information about Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited, or Yingli Green Energy, and Baoding Tianwei Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd., or Tianwei Yingli, our principal operating subsidiary and about the offering contained elsewhere in this prospectus, and is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information and financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus. You should carefully read the entire prospectus before making an investment decision, especially the information presented under the heading “Risk Factors” and the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. Yingli Green Energy was incorporated on August 7, 2006. On September 5, 2006, Yingli Group, an entity controlled by Mr. Liansheng Miao, the chairperson of the board of directors and chief executive officer of Yingli Green Energy who also controls our controlling shareholder, Yingli Power Holding Company Ltd., or Yingli Power, transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to Yingli Green Energy. As Yingli Group and Yingli Green Energy were entities under common control at the time of the transfer, the 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli was recorded by us at the historical cost to Yingli Group, which approximated the historical carrying values of the assets and liabilities of Tianwei Yingli. For financial statements reporting purposes, Tianwei Yingli was deemed to be our predecessor for periods prior to September 5, 2006. In our discussions of the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2006, we refer to certain line items in the financial statements as “combined” for comparative purposes. These unaudited combined amounts represent the addition of the amounts for certain financial statement line items or captions of Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, and the amounts for the corresponding financial statement line items or captions of Yingli Green Energy, for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30 or December 31, 2006, as applicable. For the period from August 7, 2006 through September 4, 2006, during which the financial statements of the predecessor and those of Yingli Green Energy overlap, Yingli Green Energy did not engage in any business or operations. The unaudited combined financial data for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2006 do not comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. We are including these unaudited combined amounts to supplementally provide information that we believe will be helpful to gaining a better understanding of our results of operations and improve the comparative period-to-period analysis. These unaudited combined amounts do not purport to represent what our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would have been in such period if Yingli Group had transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to us on January 1, 2006.
 
In this prospectus, except as otherwise indicated or as the context may otherwise require, all references to “Yingli Green Energy”, “we”, “the Company”, “us” and “our” refer to Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited and, unless otherwise indicated or as the context may otherwise require, to our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
We are one of the leading vertically integrated photovoltaic, or PV, product manufacturers in China. We design, manufacture and sell PV modules, and design, assemble, sell and install PV systems that are connected to an electricity transmission grid or those that operate on a stand-alone basis. With an annual production capacity of 200 megawatts for each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules as of the date of this prospectus, we believe we are currently one of the largest manufacturers of PV products in China as measured by annual production capacity. Except for the production of polysilicon materials that are used to manufacture polysilicon ingots and wafers, our products and services substantially cover the entire PV industry value chain from the manufacture of multicrystalline polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to PV systems and PV system installation. We believe we are one of the few large-scale PV companies in China to have adopted a vertically integrated business model. Our end-products include PV modules and PV systems in different sizes and power outputs. We sell PV modules under our own brand name, Yingli, to PV

system integrators and distributors located in various markets around the world, including Germany, Spain, Italy, China and the United States.
 
In 2002, we began producing PV modules with an initial annual production capacity of three megawatts and have significantly expanded production capacities of our PV products in the past five years to the current level. In April 2006, we launched a new expansion project in Baoding, China to increase our annual production capacity of our PV products. We currently plan to gradually expand annual production capacity of each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to 400 megawatts by the end of 2008 and to 600 megawatts by the end of 2009.
 
Historically, we have sold and installed PV systems in the western regions of China where substantial government-subsidized, rural electrification projects are underway. We also sell PV systems to mobile communications service providers in China for use across China and plan to export our PV systems into major international markets such as Germany, Spain, Italy and the United States. In order to promote the export of our PV systems, we have participated in the design and installation of large PV system projects undertaken by our customers overseas. For example, we cooperated with Solar-Energiedach GmbH NL in the design and installation of a one-megawatt PV system covering the roof of the Kaiserslautern soccer stadium in Germany, one of the FIFA World Cup 2006 venues. We have also been cooperating with Acciona Energia S.A. in connection with a large PV system installation project to be installed in Moura, Portugal, for which we will provide PV modules. Historically, sales of PV systems by us have not been significant. We expect our sales of PV systems to increase, although we expect such sales to remain relatively insignificant as a percentage of our net revenues in the near term.
 
Our net revenues increased from RMB 120.5 million in 2004 to RMB 361.8 million in 2005 and on a combined basis, to RMB 1,638.8 million (US$218.7 million) in 2006, and increased from RMB 1,096.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 on a combined basis to RMB 2,606.2 million (US$347.8 million) in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007. Our income from operations increased from RMB 13.7 million in 2004 to RMB 83.7 million in 2005 and, on a combined basis, to RMB 366.9 million (US$49.0 million) in 2006, and increased from RMB 285.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 on a combined basis to RMB 412.6 million (US$55.1 million) in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, representing operating profit margins of 11.4%, 23.1%, 22.4%, 26.1% and 15.8%, respectively. Our net income was RMB 6.1 million in 2004, RMB 66.0 million in 2005, RMB 186.2 million in the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, RMB 30.0 million (US$4.0 million) for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006, RMB 19.1 million (US$2.5 million) for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30, 2006 and RMB 250.6 million (US$33.4 million) in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, representing net profit margins of 5.1%, 18.2%, 21.1%, 4.0%, 9.0% and 9.6%, respectively.
 
Industry Background
 
Solar power has recently emerged as one of the most rapidly growing renewable energy sources. Through a process known as the PV effect, electricity is generated by PV cells that convert sunlight into electricity. PV modules, which are panels composed of interconnected PV cells, are mounted in areas with direct exposure to the sun to generate electricity from sunlight. PV systems, which are composed of PV modules, related power electronics and other components, are used in residential, commercial and industrial applications and for customers who have no or limited access to an electricity transmission grid.
 
Although PV technology has been used for several decades, the PV market grew significantly only in the past several years. According to Solarbuzz, an independent solar energy research and consulting firm, the global PV market, as measured by annual PV system installation, increased from 345 megawatts in 2001 to 1,744 megawatts in 2006. Solarbuzz’s “Balanced Energy” forecast scenario

2

Table of Contents

forecasted global PV industry revenues and PV system installations to be US$18.6 billion and 4,177 megawatts in 2011, respectively.
 
We believe the following factors will continue to drive the demand in the global solar power industry, including the demand for our products and services:
 
 	• 	government subsidies and economic incentives;
 
 	• 	advances in technologies making solar power more cost-efficient;
 
 	• 	rising demand for and increasing costs of fossil energy resources;
 
 	• 	increasing environmental concerns over conventional energy; and
 
 	• 	narrowing cost differentials between solar and conventional energy sources.
 
We believe the following are the key challenges presently facing the solar power industry, including us:
 
 	• 	continuing reliance on government subsidies and economic incentives;
 
 	• 	need for further cost-competitiveness;
 
 	• 	raw materials supply shortage and the increasing costs of polysilicon; and
 
 	• 	aesthetic concern.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our following strengths enable us to compete effectively and to capitalize on the rapid growth of the global PV market:
 
 	• 	vertically integrated business model;
 
 	• 	high-quality products and growing brand recognition;
 
 	• 	established customer and supplier relationships;
 
 	• 	cost-effective and efficient manufacturing process;
 
 	• 	steadily improving research and development capability; and
 
 	• 	experienced management team.
 
Our Strategies
 
We seek to continue to be a leader in the development and manufacture of PV products by taking advantage of our high degree of vertical integration in the PV production process, which yields economies of scale and cost savings. More specifically, we plan to focus on the following areas:
 
 	• 	expand global reach for our products;
 
 	• 	expand PV system sales to overseas markets;
 
 	• 	increase production capacity;
 
 	• 	secure and strengthen stable and long-term relationships with polysilicon suppliers;
 
 	• 	achieve technological advances through dedicated and continuous research and development efforts; and
 
 	• 	expand market share in China.

Our Challenges
 
The successful execution of our strategies is subject to certain risks, uncertainties and challenges, including:
 
 	• 	risks associated with our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of quality silicon raw materials in a timely manner;
 
 	• 	risks associated with the increasing price of polysilicon and its adverse effect on our profitability;
 
 	• 	risks associated with the potential reduction in or discontinuation of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy applications which could reduce demand for our products and, in turn, our revenues;
 
 	• 	uncertainties associated with responding effectively to competition in the PV modules and PV systems markets as well as from conventional energy and other renewable energy sources, including other solar energy systems;
 
 	• 	risks associated with our ability to expand our operations and manage such expansion effectively;
 
 	• 	risks associated with our ability to successfully implement our overseas expansion;
 
 	• 	risks associated with our ability to improve manufacturing efficiency or yield commercially viable new products; and
 
 	• 	uncertainties associated with our ability to establish and maintain an effective internal control system and procedures.
 
Please see “Risk Factors” and other information included in this prospectus for a detailed discussion of these and other risks, uncertainties and challenges.
 
Corporate Structure
 
We were incorporated on August 7, 2006 in the Cayman Islands as part of a restructuring of the equity interest in our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, to facilitate investments in Tianwei Yingli by foreign financial investors and the listing of our shares on an overseas stock market to achieve such investors’ investment goal and exit and liquidity strategies. As a result of the restructuring and subsequent private equity investments described in “Restructuring”:
 
 	• 	Yingli Power Holding Company Ltd., or Yingli Power, became our controlling shareholder, holding 59.58% of our issued and outstanding share capital on an as-converted, fully diluted basis immediately prior to our initial public offering;
 
 	• 	on September 5, 2006, Yingli Group, an entity controlled by Mr. Liansheng Miao, our chairperson and chief executive officer, who also controls our controlling shareholder, Yingli Power, transferred to us its 51% controlling equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. As a result of such transfer, Tianwei Yingli became our subsidiary. For financial statements reporting purposes, Tianwei Yingli is deemed to be our predecessor;
 
 	• 	Tianwei Yingli became a Sino-foreign equity joint venture enterprise established under PRC law and subject to certain PRC laws and regulations as described in “PRC Government Regulations — Equity Joint Ventures”;
 
 	• 	certain investors became holders of our Series A preferred shares, Series B preferred shares, warrants to purchase our ordinary shares and mandatory convertible bonds convertible into our ordinary shares, which represented on an aggregate basis 40.42% of our issued and outstanding share capital on an as-converted, fully diluted basis immediately prior to our initial public offering;
 
 	• 	our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli increased to 62.13% in December 2006 and further increased to 70.11% in June 2007 upon the completion of relevant PRC registration procedures for the additional equity contribution into Tianwei Yingli which was funded by the

Table of Contents

issuance of the Series B preferred shares and other financings. Pursuant to the latest amendment to our joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian and, upon obtaining requisite approval by relevant PRC authority, we expect to make an additional equity contribution into Tianwei Yingli, which would increase our equity interest to 74.01%. See “History and Restructuring — Private Equity Investments and Other Financings Following the Restructuring”;
 
 	• 	In June 2007, we completed our initial public offering and listing of our ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange. Upon completion of our initial public offering, we sold 26,550,000 ordinary shares in the form of ADSs, raising US$274,527,000 in proceeds, before expenses to us, and Yingli Power sold 2,450,000 ordinary shares in the form of ADSs; and
 
 	• 	Upon our initial public offering, all of our Series A and Series B preferred shares were converted into our ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Upon the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs, certain of our Series A and Series B shareholders sold 500,000 ordinary shares in the form of ADSs. As a result of the completion of our initial public offering, our Series A and Series B shareholders and other shareholders in the aggregate own 31.00% of our issued and outstanding share capital immediately prior to this offering.
 
Our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, was established as a PRC limited liability company in August 1998 to manufacture multicrystalline silicon ingots and wafers, PV cells, PV modules and PV systems. Tianwei Yingli holds a 100% equity interest in Chengdu Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd., or Chengdu Yingli, a PRC limited liability company in Sichuan, China, which sells PV modules and PV systems. In addition, Tianwei Yingli holds a 50% equity interest in Tibet Tianwei Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd., or Tibetan Yingli, a company established in Tibet, which sells PV systems. In July 2007, we acquired a 30% equity interest in Baoding Dongfa Tianying New Energy Resources Company Limited, or Dongfa Tianying, which manufactures and sells tempered glass and related accessories. In August 2007, we established Yingli Green Energy (International) Holding Company Limited, or Yingli International, a British Virgin Islands company limited by shares as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Yingli International is primarily engaged in the sales and marketing of PV products and relevant accessories and investment in renewable energy projects. In October 2007, we established Yingli Energy (China) Company Ltd., or Yingli China, a PRC limited liability company, as our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary. Yingli China is primarily engaged in the research, manufacturing, sale and installation of renewable energy products. We intend to make an equity contribution to Yingli China from part of the proceeds from the convertible note offering. See “Use of Proceeds”. In November 2007, we established Yingli Green Energy Europe GmbH, or Yingli Europe, a German limited liability company, as our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary. Yingli Europe is primarily engaged in the sale and marketing of PV products and relevant accessories in Europe.

Tianwei Baobian’s subscription right
If Tianwei Baobian, which holds a minority equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, exercises the right we granted to it under a PRC law-governed joint venture contract between us and Tianwei Baobian, we will be obligated to issue, after our initial public offering, a number of our ordinary shares to Tianwei Baobian in exchange for all but not part of its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli at the time of the exercise according to a pre-agreed formula. The number of our ordinary shares to be newly issued upon the exercise of Tianwei Baobian’s subscription right will be substantial, and upon such exercise, the equity interest in our company held by you in the form of ADSs will be substantially diluted. See “History and Restructuring — Joint Venture Contract — Subscription Right”.

The depositary will be the holder of the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs and you will have the rights of an ADR holder as provided in the deposit agreement among us, the depositary and owners and beneficial owners of ADSs from time to time. You may surrender your ADSs to the depositary to withdraw the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. The depositary will charge you a fee for such an exchange.
 
We may amend or terminate the deposit agreement for any reason without your consent. If an amendment becomes effective, you will be bound by the deposit agreement as amended if you continue to hold your ADSs.

The Convertible Note Offering
 
Securities offered by us		US$150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2012, or the notes. See “Description of the Notes”.

Maturity		The notes will mature on December   , 2012, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted.
 
Ranking		The notes will be our senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The notes will be effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness and all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables. As of September 30, 2007, our subsidiaries had approximately US$189.7 million of indebtedness and other obligations, to which the notes would be structurally subordinated.
 
Conversion rights		The notes will be convertible into, at our election, our ADSs, cash or a combination thereof based on an initial conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of           ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately US$           per ADS), only in the following circumstances and to the following extent:
 
• the notes will be convertible during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending             , if the closing sale price of our ADSs for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds     % of the conversion price of such notes in

10

Table of Contents

effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;
 
• the notes will be convertible during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (we refer to this five consecutive trading day period as the “note measurement period”) if the average trading price per US$1,000 principal amount of notes during the note measurement period was equal to or less than     % of the average conversion value of the notes during such period;
 
• the notes will be convertible if we make certain distributions on our ordinary shares or engage in certain transactions; and
 
• the notes will be convertible if we call the notes for redemption.
 
The notes will be convertible at any time during the period from, and including,           to, and including the third business day preceding the maturity date.
 
See “Description of the Notes — Conversion Rights”.
 
Settlement upon conversion		In lieu of delivery of ADSs in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the notes, we may elect to deliver cash or a combination of cash and ADSs. We will give notice, which shall be irrevocable, to holders through the trustee of the method we choose to satisfy our obligation upon conversion. If we do not give any notice within the applicable time period as to how we intend to settle, we shall satisfy our conversion obligation only in ADSs and cash in lieu of fractional ADSs. We will treat all holders converting on the same day in the same manner, but are not obligated to settle our conversion obligations on different days in the same manner.
 
If we elect to satisfy our entire conversion obligation in cash, we will deliver to you cash in an amount equal to the product of:
 
• a number equal to (1) the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted divided by US$1,000 multiplied by (2) the conversion rate, and
 
• the average daily VWAP of our ADSs during the cash settlement averaging period.
 
If we elect to satisfy a percentage or fixed amount (but not all) of our conversion obligation per US$1,000 principal amount of notes in cash, we will deliver to you:
 
• a dollar amount (in each case, the “cash amount”) representing the percentage that we elect of the “conversion amount” or such fixed amount per US$1,000 principal amount of notes (provided that if such fixed amount exceeds the conversion amount, we will deliver the conversion amount in cash in lieu of such fixed amount); and

11

Table of Contents

 
• a number of ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount of notes equal to the, for each VWAP trading day of the cash settlement averaging period, the greater of:
 
• zero, and
 
• a number of ADSs determined by the following formula:
 
(daily VWAP of our ADSs on such VWAP trading day × the conversion rate) — the cash amount
daily VWAP of our ADS on such VWAP trading day × 20
 
Except in some instances, the “cash settlement averaging period” generally means the 20 consecutive VWAP trading day period beginning on (and including) the second VWAP trading day after the conversion date.
 
The “conversion amount” means the average of the products for each VWAP trading day of the cash settlement averaging period of (i) the conversion rate for such day multiplied by (ii) the daily VWAP of our ADSs on such day multiplied by (iii) the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted divided by US$1,000.
 
The “daily VWAP” for our ADSs means, for each of the 20 consecutive VWAP trading days during each cash settlement averaging period, the per ADS volume-weighted average price as displayed under the heading “Bloomberg VWAP” on Bloomberg page YGE.N <equity> AQR (or any equivalent successor page if such page is not available) in respect of the period from the scheduled open of trading on the principal trading market for our ADSs to the scheduled close of trading on such market on such VWAP trading day, or if such volume-weighted average price is unavailable, the market value of one ADS on such VWAP trading day as our board of directors determines in good faith using a volume-weighted method. A “VWAP trading day” means a day during which (i) trading in our ADSs generally occurs on the principal U.S. national securities exchange on which our ADSs are listed and (ii) there is no VWAP market disruption event (as defined in the indenture). If our ADSs are not so listed, then “VWAP trading day” means a business day.
 
A holder that surrenders notes for conversion in connection with a “make-whole fundamental change” may in certain circumstances be entitled to an increased conversion rate. See “Description of the Notes — Conversion Rights”.
 
Sinking fund		None.
 
Redemption Upon Maturity		Upon maturity, we will redeem the notes at            % of the principal amount of the notes.
 
Redemption of notes at our option		We may, at our option, redeem the notes, at any time on or after          , in whole or in part from time to time in integral multiples of US$1,000 at a redemption price in cash equal to the early redemption amount of the notes we redeem, provided that the closing sale price of our ADSs for at least 20

12

Table of Contents

trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the date one trading day prior to the date of the notice of redemption is greater than      % of the early redemption amount of the notes divided by the conversion rate on the date of such notice. See “Description of the Notes — Redemption of Notes at Our Option”.
 
Purchase of notes by us at the option of the holder		On February 15, 2010, holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their outstanding notes, in an integral multiple of $1,000 at a price in cash equal to     % of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date, subject to certain additional conditions. See “Description of the Notes — Purchase of Notes by Us at the Option of the Holder.”
 
Right of holder to require us to repurchase notes if a fundamental change occurs		If a fundamental change, as described in this prospectus, occurs, holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to the early redemption amount of the notes to be repurchased. See “Description of the Notes — Repurchase of Notes by Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change”.
 
Events of default		If an event of default on the notes has occurred and is continuing, the principal amount of the notes may be declared immediately due and payable, subject to certain conditions set forth in the indenture. These amounts automatically become due and payable upon certain events of default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or our subsidiaries. See “Description of the Notes — Events of Default”.
 
Use of proceeds		We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately US$144.8 million from the offering of the notes after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase up to an aggregate of an additional US$22,500,000 principal amount of the notes is exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds we will receive will be approximately US$166.7 million.
 
We intend to use our net proceeds for the following purposes:
 
• approximately US$100 million to make an equity contribution to our newly formed subsidiary, Yingli China, in connection with our capacity expansion plan; and
 
• the remaining amount for other general corporate purposes.
 
See “Use of Proceeds” for additional information.
 
Risk factors		See “Risk Factors” and other information included in this prospectus for a discussion of the risks you should carefully consider before deciding to invest in the notes.

SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA
 
The following tables present the summary consolidated financial information of us and our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli. You should read this information together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this prospectus. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in the future.
 
Yingli Green Energy was incorporated on August 7, 2006. For the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 4, 2006, Yingli Green Energy did not engage in any business or operations. On September 5, 2006, Yingli Group, an entity controlled by Mr. Liansheng Miao, our chairperson and chief executive officer, who also controls our controlling shareholder, Yingli Power, transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to Yingli Green Energy. For further details on this transaction, see “History and Restructuring”. As Yingli Group and we were entities under common control at the time of the transfer, the transfer of 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli was recorded by us at the historical cost to Yingli Group. For financial statements reporting purposes, Tianwei Yingli is deemed to be our predecessor for periods prior to September 5, 2006.
 
The summary consolidated statement of income data and other consolidated financial data for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and the summary consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2004 and 2005 and September 4, 2006 have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, included elsewhere in the prospectus. The summary consolidated statement of income data (other than per ADS data) and other consolidated financial data for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and the summary consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2006 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The consolidated financial statements of each of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 
The unaudited combined summary consolidated statement of income data and other consolidated financial data represent the addition of the amounts of certain financial statement line items or captions of Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, and the amounts for the corresponding line items or captions of Yingli Green Energy for the periods from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30 or December 31, 2006, as applicable. For the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 4, 2006, during which the financial statements of the predecessor and those of Yingli Green Energy overlap, Yingli Green Energy did not engage in any business or operations. The unaudited combined summary consolidated statement of income data and other consolidated financial data for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2006 do not comply with U.S. GAAP. We are including these unaudited combined financial data that we believe is helpful to gaining a better understanding of results of operations and to improve the comparative period-to-period analysis. These unaudited combined amounts do not purport to represent what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been if Yingli Group had transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to us on January 1, 2006.
 
The summary consolidated statement of income data (other than per ADS data) and other consolidated financial data for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30, 2006 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 and the summary consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 2007 have been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We have prepared the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements. The unaudited financial information includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the periods presented.

Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry
 
We are currently experiencing and may continue to experience an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon. Our failure to obtain sufficient quantities of polysilicon in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, prevent us from operating at full capacity or limit our ability to expand as planned, which will reduce, and limit the growth of, our manufacturing output and revenue.
 
Polysilicon is the most important raw material used in the production of our PV products. To maintain competitive manufacturing operations, we depend on timely delivery by our suppliers of polysilicon in sufficient quantities. The global supply of polysilicon is controlled by a limited number of producers, and there is currently an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon. The current shortage of polysilicon is the result of a combination of factors, including a significant increase in demand for polysilicon due to the rapid growth of the PV industry, the significant lead time required for building additional capacity for polysilicon production and significant competing demand for polysilicon from the semiconductor industry.
 
Partly as a result of the industry-wide shortage, we have from time to time faced the prospect of a shortage of polysilicon and late or failed delivery of polysilicon from suppliers. We may experience actual shortage of polysilicon or late or failed delivery in the future for the following reasons, among others. First, the terms of our polysilicon contracts with, or purchase orders to, our suppliers may be altered or cancelled by the suppliers with limited or no penalty to them, in which case we may not be able to recover damages fully or at all. Second, we generally do not have a history of long-term relationships with polysilicon suppliers who may be able to meet our polysilicon needs consistently or on an emergency basis. Third, compared to us, many of our competitors who also purchase polysilicon from our suppliers have had longer and stronger relationships with and greater buying power and bargaining leverage over our suppliers.
 
If we fail to obtain delivery of polysilicon in amounts and according to time schedules as agreed with the suppliers, or at all, we may be forced to reduce production or secure alternative sources of polysilicon in the spot market, which may not provide polysilicon in amounts required by us or at comparable or affordable prices, or at all. Our failure to obtain the required amounts of polysilicon on time and at affordable prices can seriously hamper our ability to meet our contractual obligations to deliver PV products to our customers. Any failure by us to meet such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, retention of customers, market share, business and results of operations and may subject us to claims from our customers and other disputes. In addition, our failure to obtain sufficient polysilicon will result in underutilization of our existing and new production facilities and an increase of our marginal production cost, and may prevent us from implementing capacity expansion as currently planned. Any of the above events could have a material adverse effect on our growth, profitability and results of operations.
 
The price of polysilicon may continue to rise and we may not be able to pass on the increase in raw material costs to our customers, which may reduce our profitability.
 
The industry-wide shortage of polysilicon has resulted in a significant increase in polysilicon prices. Our average purchase price of polysilicon per kilogram has increased by 106.5% in 2005 compared to 2004, 185.5% in 2006 compared to 2005, 45.2% in the nine-month period ended

September 30, 2007 compared to the full year in 2006 and by 80.9% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006. We believe the average price of polysilicon will remain high in the near term compared to its historical levels. The increasing price of polysilicon has largely contributed to the increase in our production costs for PV modules in the past three years and in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 and may continue to have the same effect in the future, notwithstanding our continuing efforts to use polysilicon more efficiently.
 
Despite the rise in the price of polysilicon, PV module manufacturers worldwide are expanding their production capacities in response to the growing popularity worldwide of PV products. We believe that such capacity expansion, in addition to a decline in government subsidies to promote solar energy consumption in certain countries, will cause a gradual decline in the price of PV modules, which may more than offset any cost savings from technological improvements that lead to a more efficient use of polysilicon. In addition, in case of a general decline in the price of PV modules, we may not be able to pass to our customers our increased production costs resulting from, among others, the increased costs of polysilicon. Any significant decline of the price for PV modules, together with the rising production costs for PV modules, would materially and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.
 
A significant reduction in or discontinuation of government subsidies and economic incentives may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Demand for our products depends substantially on government incentives aimed to promote greater use of solar power. In many countries in which we are currently, or intend to become, active, the PV markets, particularly the market of on-grid PV systems, would not be commercially viable without government incentives. This is because the cost of generating electricity from solar power currently exceeds, and we believe will continue to exceed for the foreseeable future, the costs of generating electricity from conventional or non-solar renewable energy sources.
 
The scope of the government incentives for solar power depends, to a large extent, on political and policy developments in a given country related to environmental concerns, which could lead to a significant reduction in or a discontinuation of the support for renewable energies in such country. For example, in Germany, the feed-in tariffs, which require grid system operators to purchase electricity from renewable energy sources at fixed rates, are subject to scheduled reviews by the end of 2007 under the Renewable Energies Act. Utility companies and grid operators burdened by the minimum feed-in tariffs under the Renewable Energies Act in Germany or by comparable regulations in other countries may lobby for a reduction in or cancellation of such tariffs. In addition, in certain countries, including countries to which we export PV products, government financial support of PV products has been, and may continue to be, challenged as being unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful. A significant reduction in the scope or discontinuation of government incentive programs, such as the Renewable Energies Act, would have a materially adverse effect on the demand for our PV modules as well as our results of operations.
 
Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial majority of polysilicon could prevent us from delivering our products in a timely manner to our customers in the required quantities, which could result in order cancellations, decreased revenue and loss of market share.
 
In 2006 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, our five largest suppliers supplied in the aggregate approximately 83.6% and 79.0%, respectively, of our total polysilicon purchases. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these or our other suppliers, we may be unable to manufacture our products, our products may only be available at a higher cost or after a long delay, or we could be prevented from delivering our products to our customers in the required quantities, at competitive prices and on acceptable terms of delivery. Problems of this kind could cause us to experience order cancellations, decreased revenue and loss of market share. In general,

the failure of a supplier to supply materials and components that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner due to lack of supplies or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our costs, particularly if we are unable to obtain these materials and components from alternative sources in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. Some of our suppliers have a limited operating history and limited financial resources, and the contracts we entered into with these suppliers do not clearly provide for remedies to us in the event any of these suppliers is not able to, or otherwise does not, deliver, in a timely manner or at all, any materials it is contractually obligated to deliver. Any disruption in the supply of polysilicon to us may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In addition, due to a shortage of raw materials for the production of PV modules, increased market demand for polysilicon raw materials, a failure by some polysilicon suppliers to achieve expected production volumes and other factors during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, a few of our polysilicon suppliers failed to fully perform on their polysilicon supply contractual commitments to us, and we consequently did not receive part of the contractually agreed quantities of polysilicon raw materials from these suppliers which represented approximately 8.4% of the total committed quantities polysilicon supplies under contracts entered into by the Company during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007. We subsequently cancelled or renegotiated these polysilicon supply contracts. While we in each case were able to replace such expected deliveries through purchases of polysilicon from the spot market and new supply contracts, we cannot assure you that any future failure of our suppliers to deliver agreed quantities of polysilicon could be substantially replaced in a timely manner or at all through spot market purchases or new supply contracts or that the price of such purchases or terms of such contracts will be favorable to us.
 
We depend, and expect to continue to depend, on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenues. As a result, the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and harm our results of operations. In addition, a significant portion of our outstanding account receivable is derived from sales to a limited number of customers. Failure of any of these customers to meet their payment obligations would materially and adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
 
We currently expect that our results of operations will, for the foreseeable future, continue to depend on the sale of our PV modules to a relatively small number of customers until we become successful in significantly expanding our customer base or diversifying product offerings. In 2005, 2006 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, sales to our customers that individually exceeded 10% of our net revenues accounted for approximately 38.7%, 38.9% and 50.7%, respectively, of our net revenues. Our relationships with such key customers have been developed over a short period of time and are generally in their early stages. We cannot assure you that these customers will continue to generate significant revenues for us or that we will be able to maintain these customer relationships. In addition, our business is affected by competition in the market for the products that many of our major customers sell, and any decline in the businesses of our customers could reduce the purchase of our products by these customers. The loss of sales to any of these customers could also have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.
 
In addition, a significant portion of our outstanding accounts receivable is derived from sales to a limited number of customers. As of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, our top five customers in terms of outstanding accounts receivable accounted for approximately 85.4% and 61.8%, respectively, of our total outstanding accounts receivable. We are exposed to the credit risk of these customers, some of which are new customers with whom we have not had extensive business dealings historically. The failure of any of these customers to meet their payment obligations would materially and adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.

We face intense competition in the PV modules and PV system markets and our PV products compete with different solar energy systems as well as other renewable energy sources in the alternative energy market. If we fail to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors, our business prospects and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.
 
The PV market is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. The number of PV product manufacturers is rapidly increasing due to the growth of actual and forecast demand for PV products and the relatively low barriers to entry. If we fail to attract and retain customers in our target markets for our current and future core products, namely PV modules and PV systems, we will be unable to increase our revenues and market share.
 
Since 2004, a substantial majority of our revenues have been derived from overseas markets, particularly Germany, and increasingly Spain, Italy and the United States, and we expect these trends to continue. A substantial portion of our revenues is also derived from China. In these markets, we often compete with local and international producers of PV products that are substantially larger than us, including the solar energy divisions of large conglomerates such as BP Solar and Sharp Corporation, PV module manufacturers such as Sunpower Corp. and Suntech Power Holdings Co., Ltd., and integrated PV product manufacturers such as SolarWorld AG, Renewable Energy Corporation and Trina Solar Limited.
 
We may also face competition from new entrants to the PV market, including those that offer more advanced technological solutions or that have greater financial resources, such as semiconductor manufacturers, several of which have announced their intention to start production of PV cells and PV modules. A significant number of our competitors are developing or currently producing products based on the more advanced PV technologies, including thin film solar module, amorphous silicon, string ribbon and nano technologies, which may eventually offer cost advantages over the crystalline polysilicon technologies currently used by us. A widespread adoption of any of these technologies could result in a rapid decline in our position in the renewable energy market and our revenues if we fail to adopt such technologies. In addition, like us, some of our competitors have become, or are becoming, vertically integrated in the PV industry value chain, from silicon ingot manufacturing to PV system sales and installation. This could further erode our competitive advantage. Furthermore, the entire PV industry also faces competition from conventional energy and non-solar renewable energy providers.
 
Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and other resources than we do. The greater size of many of our competitors provides them with cost advantages as a result of their economies of scale and their ability to obtain volume discounts and purchase raw materials at lower prices. For example, our competitors that also manufacture semiconductors may compete with us for the procurement of silicon raw materials. As a result, such competitors may have stronger bargaining power with their suppliers and have an advantage over us in pricing as well as securing sufficient supply of polysilicon during times of shortage. Many of our competitors also have better brand name recognition, more established distribution networks, larger customer bases or more in-depth knowledge of the target markets. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the research and development, promotion and sale of their products and respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions as compared to us. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or future competitors would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.
 
If PV technology is not suitable for widespread adoption, or sufficient demand for PV products does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipated, our sales may not continue to increase or may even decline, and we may be unable to sustain profitability.
 
The PV market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which PV products will be widely adopted is uncertain. The PV industry may also be particularly susceptible to economic

downturns. Market data in the PV industry are not as readily available as those in other more established industries where trends can be assessed more reliably from data gathered over a longer period of time. If PV technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption or if demand for PV products fails to develop sufficiently, we may not be able to grow our business or generate sufficient revenues to sustain our profitability. In addition, demand for PV products in our targeted markets, including China, may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipated. Many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of PV technology and demand for PV products, including (i) cost-effectiveness of PV products compared to conventional and other non-solar energy sources and products; (ii) performance and reliability of PV products compared to conventional and other non-solar energy sources and products; (iii) availability of government subsidies and incentives to support the development of the PV industry; (iv) success of other alternative energy generation technologies, such as fuel cells, wind power and biomass; (v) fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar alternative energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels; (vi) capital expenditures by end users of PV products, which tend to decrease when economy slows down; and (vii) deregulation of the electric power industry and broader energy industry.
 
Advance payment arrangements between us and most of our polysilicon suppliers and equipment suppliers expose us to the credit risks of such suppliers and may increase our costs and expenses, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.
 
Under existing supply contracts with most of our polysilicon suppliers and our equipment suppliers, consistent with the industry practice, we make advance payments to our suppliers prior to the scheduled delivery dates for polysilicon and equipment. In many such cases, we make the advance payments without receiving collateral for such payments. As a result, our claims for such payments would rank as unsecured claims, which would expose us to the credit risks of our suppliers in the event of their insolvency or bankruptcy. Under such circumstances, our claims against the defaulting suppliers would rank below those of secured creditors, which would undermine our chances of obtaining the return of our advance payments. In addition, if the market price of polysilicon decreases after we prepay our suppliers, we will not be able to adjust any historical payment insofar as it relates to a future delivery at a fixed price. Furthermore, if demand for our products decreases, we may incur costs associated with carrying excess materials. Accordingly, any of the above scenarios may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
 
Our expansion plans require substantial capital expenditures, significant engineering efforts, timely delivery of manufacturing equipment and dedicated management attention, and our failure to complete these plans would have a material adverse effect on the growth of our sales and earnings.
 
Our future success depends, to a large extent, on our ability to expand our production capacity. If we are unable to do so, we will not be able to attain the desired level of economies of scale in our operations or cut the marginal production cost to the level necessary to effectively maintain our pricing and other competitive advantages. We expect that we will make substantial capital expenditures for our future growth. This expansion has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures, significant engineering efforts, timely delivery of manufacturing equipment and dedicated management attention, and is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including:
 
 	• 	we may need to continue to contribute significant additional capital to our subsidiaries through the issuance of our equity or debt securities in order to finance the costs of developing the new facilities, which may not be conducted on reasonable terms or may not be conducted at all, and which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Such capital contribution would also require PRC regulatory approvals in order for the proceeds from such issuances to be

22

Table of Contents

 		transferred to our subsidiaries, which approvals may not be granted in a timely manner or at all;
 
 	• 	we will be required to obtain governmental approvals, permits or documents of similar nature with respect to any new expansion projects, but it is uncertain whether such approvals, permits or documents will be obtained in a timely manner or at all;
 
 	• 	we may experience cost overruns, construction delays, equipment problems, including delays in manufacturing equipment deliveries or deliveries of equipment that is damaged or does not meet our specifications, and other operating difficulties;
 
 	• 	we are using new equipment and technology to lower our unit capital and operating costs, but we cannot assure you that such effort will be successful; and
 
 	• 	we may not have sufficient management resources to properly oversee capacity expansion as currently planned.
 
Any of these or similar difficulties could significantly delay or otherwise constrain our ability to undertake our capacity expansion plans as currently planned, which in turn would limit our ability to increase sales, reduce marginal manufacturing costs or otherwise improve our prospects and profitability.
 
We may undertake acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business, and such undertakings may be unsuccessful.
 
Our strategy includes plans to grow both organically and through acquisitions, participation in joint ventures or other strategic alliances with suppliers or other companies in China and overseas along the PV industry value chain. Joint ventures and strategic alliances may expose us to new operational, regulatory, market and geographic risks as well as risks associated with additional capital requirements.
 
Acquisitions of companies or businesses and participation in joint ventures or other strategic alliances are subject to considerable risks, including:
 
 	• 	our inability to integrate new operations, personnel, products, services and technologies;
 
 	• 	unforeseen or hidden liabilities, including exposure to lawsuits associated with newly acquired companies;
 
 	• 	the diversion of resources from our existing businesses;
 
 	• 	disagreement with joint venture or strategic alliance partners;
 
 	• 	contravention of regulations governing cross-border investment;
 
 	• 	failure to comply with laws and regulations as well as industry or technical standards of the overseas markets into which we expand;
 
 	• 	our inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, strategic investments, joint venture formations or other strategic alliances; and
 
 	• 	potential loss of, or harm to, employees or customer relationships.
 
Any of these events could disrupt our ability to manage our business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Such risks could also result in our failure to derive the intended benefits of the acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures or strategic alliances and we may be unable to recover our investment in such initiatives.

Our product development initiatives may fail to improve manufacturing efficiency or yield commercially viable new products.
 
We are making efforts to improve our manufacturing processes and improve the quality of our PV products. We plan to undertake research and development to continuously reduce the thickness of our wafers and develop more advanced products. We are also exploring ways to improve our PV module production. Additional research and development efforts will be required before our products in development may be manufactured and sold at a commercially viable level. We cannot assure you that such efforts will improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes or yield new products that are commercially viable. In addition, the failure to realize the intended benefits from our product development initiatives could limit our ability to keep pace with the rapid technological changes, which in turn would hurt our business and prospects.
 
Failure to achieve satisfactory output of our PV modules and PV systems could result in a decline in sales.
 
The manufacture of PV modules and PV systems is a highly complex process. Deviations in the manufacturing process can cause a substantial decrease in output and, in some cases, disrupt production significantly or result in no output. We have from time to time experienced lower-than-anticipated manufacturing output during the ramp-up of production lines. This often occurs during the production of new products, the installation of new equipment or the implementation of new process technologies. As we bring additional lines or facilities into production, we may operate at less than intended capacity during the ramp-up period and produce less output than expected. This would result in higher marginal production costs which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 
We believe the efficient use of polysilicon is essential to reducing our manufacturing costs. We have been exploring several measures to improve the efficient use of polysilicon in our manufacturing process, including reducing the thickness of silicon wafers. However, the use of thinner silicon wafers may have unforeseen negative consequences, such as increased breakage and reduced reliability and conversion efficiency of our PV cells and modules. As a result, reducing the thickness of silicon wafers may not lead to the cost reductions we expect to achieve, while at the same time it may reduce customer satisfaction with our products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships, reputation and results of operations. In addition, we also plan to reduce manufacturing costs by utilizing polysilicon scraps and lower-grade polysilicon to produce monocrystalline silicon suitable for combining into our production of ingots and wafers. However, while the addition of monocrystalline silicon to our production of ingots and wafers may reduce costs of polysilicon supply, we cannot assure you that such benefits will not be outweighted by the additional costs of equipment and production costs to produce monocrystalline silicon.
 
Unsatisfactory performance of or defects in our products may cause us to incur warranty expenses, damage our reputation and cause our sales to decline.
 
Our PV modules are typically sold with a two-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a 10-year and 25-year warranty against declines of initial power generation capacity by more than 10.0% and 20.0%, respectively. As a result, we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we sell our products and recognize revenues. As we began selling PV modules only since January 2003, none of our PV modules has been in use for more than five years. For our PV systems in China, we provide a one-to five-year limited warranty against defects in modules, storage batteries and certain other system parts. As of December 31, 2005, 2006 and as of September 30, 2007, our accrued warranty costs amounted to RMB 5.0 million, RMB 20.7 million (US$2.8 million) and RMB 46.5 million (US$6.2 million), respectively. Because our products have only been in use for a relatively short period of time, our assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our products may not be accurate, and because our products have relatively long warranty periods, we cannot assure you that the amount of accrued warranty by us for our products will be adequate in light of the actual performance of our products. If we experience a significant increase in warranty

claims, we may incur significant repair and replacement costs associated with such claims. Furthermore, widespread product failures will damage our reputation and customer relationships and may cause our sales to decline, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
We have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims, business interruption or natural disasters.
 
We are exposed to risks associated with product liability claims if the use of our PV products results in injury. Since our PV products are components of electricity producing devices, it is possible that users could be injured or killed by our PV products, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. We do not maintain any business interruption insurance coverage. As a result, we may have to pay, out of our own funds, for financial and other losses, damages and liabilities, including those in connection with or resulting from third-party product liability claims and those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
We obtain some of the equipment used in our manufacturing process from a small number of selected suppliers and if our equipment is damaged or new or replacement equipment is not delivered to us in a timely manner or is otherwise unavailable, our ability to deliver products timely will suffer, which in turn could result in cancellations of orders and loss of revenue for us.
 
Some of the equipment used in our production of polysilicon ingots, wafers, PV cells and PV modules, such as ingot cashing furnaces, diffusion furnaces and wire saws, have been customized to our specifications, are not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace. If any of our key equipment suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business, we may have difficulties with repairing or replacing our customized equipment in the event of any damage to or a breakdown of such equipment. Furthermore, new or replacement equipment may not be delivered to us in a timely manner. In such cases, our ability to deliver products in a timely manner would suffer, which in turn could result in cancellations of orders from our customers and loss of revenue for us. In addition, the equipment we need for our expansion is in high demand. In addition, supplier’s failure to deliver the equipment in a timely manner, in sufficient quantity and on terms acceptable to us could delay our capacity expansion and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our production costs.
 
The practice of requiring our customers to make advance payments when they place orders with us has diminished, we have experienced and will continue to experience increased needs to finance our working capital requirements and are exposed to increased credit risk.
 
Historically, we required many of our customers to make an advance payment of a certain percentage of their orders, a business practice that helped us to manage our accounts receivable, prepay our suppliers and reduce the amount of funds that we needed to finance our working capital requirements. However, this practice of requiring our customers to make advance payments has diminished, which in turn has increased our need to obtain additional short-term borrowings to fund our current cash requirements. For the nine months period ended September 30, 2007, a small portion of our revenue was derived from sales that required advance payments from our customers. Currently, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from credits sales to our customers, generally with payments due within two to five months. In addition, other customers now pay us through letters of credit, which typically take 30 to 90 days to process for us to be paid. As a result, the general decrease in the use of cash advance payments has negatively impacted our short-term liquidity and, coupled with increased sales to a small number of major customers, exposed us to additional and more concentrated credit risk since a significant portion of our outstanding accounts receivable is derived from sales to a limited number of customers. As of December 31, 2006 and September 30,

Table of Contents

2007, our top five customers in terms of outstanding accounts receivable accounted for approximately 85.4% and 61.8%, respectively, of our total outstanding accounts receivable. The failure of any of these customers to meet their payment obligations would materially and adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Although we have been able to maintain adequate working capital primarily through short-term borrowing, in the future we may not be able to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us or at all.
 
Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations
 
Most of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, and to a lesser extent, in Renminbi, while a substantial portion of our costs and expenses is denominated in U.S. dollars, Renminbi, Japanese Yen and Euros. In addition, we must convert Renminbi into foreign currencies to make payments to overseas suppliers. Therefore, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant effect on our results of operations due to mismatches among various foreign currency-denominated transactions, including sales of PV modules in overseas markets and purchases of silicon raw materials and equipment, and the time gap between the signing of the related contracts and cash receipts and disbursements related to such contracts.
 
We incurred net foreign exchange losses of RMB 1.8 million in 2005 and RMB 8.1 million (US$1.1 million) in 2006 primarily due to the adjustment of the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Renminbi, effective July 21, 2005. We also recorded a net foreign currency exchange loss of RMB 3.5 million (US$0.5 million) in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, primarily due to foreign exchange loss related to sales denominated in U.S. dollars, which was partially offset by increased sales denominated in Euro during this period as Euro appreciated against Renminbi. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our net foreign exchange losses in the future. We may choose to reduce the effect of such exposure through hedging arrangements, but because of the limited availability of hedging instruments in China, we cannot assure you that we will find a hedging arrangement suitable to us, or that such hedging activities will be effective in managing our foreign exchange risk.
 
We face risks associated with the marketing and sale of our PV products internationally, and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our ability to expand our business abroad will be limited.
 
In 2005, 2006 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, we sold 84.3%, 95.1% and 98.1%, respectively, of our products to customers outside of China, including customers in Germany, Spain, Italy and the United States. We intend to further grow our business activities in international markets, in particular in the United States, Spain and selected countries in southern Europe and Southeast Asia where we believe the PV market is likely to grow significantly in the near term. The marketing and sale of our PV products to international markets expose us to a number of risks, including, but not limited, to:
 
 	• 	fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
 
 	• 	increased costs associated with maintaining the ability to understand the local markets and follow their trends, as well as develop and maintain effective marketing and distributing presence in various countries;
 
 	• 	the availability of advances from our customers;
 
 	• 	providing customer service and support in these markets;
 
 	• 	difficulty with staffing and managing overseas operations;
 
 	• 	failure to develop appropriate risk management and internal control structures tailored to overseas operations;

26

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	difficulty and cost relating to compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas markets in which we offer or plan to offer our products and services;
 
 	• 	failure to obtain or maintain certifications for our products or services in these markets;
 
 	• 	inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights;
 
 	• 	unanticipated changes in prevailing economic conditions and regulatory requirements; and
 
 	• 	trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses.
 
Our business in foreign markets requires us to respond timely and effectively to rapid changes in market conditions in the relevant countries. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to succeed in different legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where it does business. To the extent that we conduct business in foreign countries by means of participations or joint ventures, there are additional risks. See “ — We may undertake acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business, and such undertakings may end up being unsuccessful”. A change in one or more of the factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We have significant outstanding short-term borrowings, and we may not be able to obtain extensions when they mature.
 
Our short-term borrowings from banks outstanding as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, were RMB 279.0 million, RMB 255.3 million (US$34.1 million) and RMB 1,152.0 million (US$153.7 million), respectively, and bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.42%, 5.99% and 5.91%, respectively, of which RMB 222.0 million, RMB 221.0 million (US$29.5 million) and RMB 472.4 million (US$63.0 million) were arranged or guaranteed by related parties as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. For the period from October 1, 2007 to October 31, 2007, we borrowed additional short-term loans of RMB 94.5 million (US$12.6 million) and repaid RMB 86.4 million (US$11.5 million). Other non-bank short-term borrowings, consisting principally of loans from a customer, a government body and loans arranged by Mr. Liansheng Miao, the chairperson of our board of directors and our chief executive officer, amounted to RMB 67.7 million, RMB 12.0 million (US$1.6 million) and nil, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007. We also have short-term borrowings from related parties, the outstanding amount of which was RMB 100.4 million, RMB 31.8 million (US$4.3 million) and RMB 3.6 million (US$0.5 million) as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively, which represents 22.4%, 10.6% and 0.3% of our short-term borrowings, as of the same dates, respectively.
 
Generally, these loans contain no specific renewal terms, although we have traditionally negotiated renewal of certain of the loans shortly before they mature. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these loans in the future as they mature. In particular, a substantial portion of our short-term borrowings are arranged or guaranteed by Tianwei Baobian or its controlling shareholder, Tianwei Group. Since Tianwei Baobian is no longer Tianwei Yingli’s controlling equity interest holder, both Tianwei Baobian and Tianwei Group may be less inclined to guarantee bank borrowings of Tianwei Yingli. If we are unable to obtain renewals of these loans or sufficient alternative funding on reasonable terms from banks or related or third parties, we will have to repay these borrowings with additional funding from Tianwei Yingli’s equity interest holders, including us, or cash generated by our future operations, if any. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay these borrowings.

Most of our production, storage, administrative and research and development facilities are located in close proximity to one another in an industrial park in China. Any damage or disruption at these facilities would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our production, storage, administrative, research and development facilities are located in close proximity to one another in an industrial park in Baoding, Hebei Province, China. A natural disaster or other unanticipated catastrophic event, including power interruption, and war, could significantly disrupt our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. If any of our production facilities or material equipment were to experience any significant damage or downtime, we would be unable to meet our production targets and our business would suffer.
 
Our manufacturing processes generate noise, waste water, gaseous and other industrial wastes. This creates a risk of work-related accidents and places high demands on work safety measures. No major injuries have occurred at our facilities in connection with work-related accidents to date. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that accidents involving serious or fatal injuries will not occur at our facilities. Furthermore, there is a risk of contamination and environmental damage associated with hazardous substances used in our production processes. The materialization of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our controlling shareholder has significant influence over our management and their interests may not be aligned with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders.
 
Yingli Power, which is 100% owned by Liansheng Miao, the chairperson of our board of directors and our chief executive officer and the vice chairperson and the chief executive officer of Tianwei Yingli, currently beneficially owns approximately 45.76% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Upon completion of the ADS offering, approximately 45.68% of our outstanding ordinary shares will be held by Yingli Power. The interests of this shareholder may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. Yingli Power has significant influence over us, including on matters relating to mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of us or of our assets and might reduce the price of our ADSs and the notes. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by our other shareholders, including those who purchase ADSs in this offering or receive ADSs upon the conversion of the notes.
 
You will experience substantial dilution immediately upon Tianwei Baobian’s exercise of the subscription right that we granted under the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian.
 
Under a PRC law-governed joint venture contract between us and Tianwei Baobian entered in August 2006, as amended from time to time after August 2006, we granted to Tianwei Baobian a right to subscribe for ordinary shares newly issued by us in exchange for all but not part of Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest in Tianwei Yingli on the condition that Tianwei Baobian has obtained all necessary approvals from the relevant PRC government authorities for acquiring our shares after completion of our initial public offering and listing of our ADSs on the NYSE. If Tianwei Baobian exercises the subscription right, we will be obligated to issue such number of our ordinary shares that represent the value of Tianwei Baobian’s interest in Tianwei Yingli according to a pre-agreed formula. Such number of new shares will be substantial. See “History and Restructuring — Joint Venture Contract — Subscription Right”. As a result, the equity interest that you hold in us in the form of ADSs will be substantially diluted.

We may not be able to obtain adequate funding to acquire the equity interest in Tianwei Yingli held by Tianwei Baobian, and if we issue new shares to raise funds to acquire Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest, you may experience substantial dilution.
 
Under the joint venture contract entered into between Tianwei Baobian and us, Tianwei Baobian may request us to make best efforts to purchase all, but not part, of its then-owned equity interest in Tianwei Yingli if Tianwei Baobian fails to exercise the right to subscribe for newly issued ordinary shares of us for any reason within 300 days after completion of our initial public offering on June 13, 2007. The price will be decided by mutual agreement between Tianwei Baobian and us based on the then fair market value of the equity interest in Tianwei Yingli held by Tianwei Baobian and in accordance with the requirements of relevant laws and regulations of the PRC. If the purchase of Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest in Tianwei Yingli is required to be paid in cash, we may not be able to obtain adequate funding in time and on terms acceptable to us, if at all, to pay for such purchase price. In addition, we may decide to issue new shares to raise the funds required to pay the purchase price to Tianwei Baobian. If we choose to do so, the equity interest you hold in us may be substantially diluted immediately upon our issuance of new shares.
 
Tianwei Baobian has significant influence over Tianwei Yingli, our principal operating entity, from which we currently derive substantially all of our revenue and earnings, and Tianwei Baobian may influence Tianwei Yingli from taking actions that are in the best interest of us or Tianwei Yingli, which could result in a material adverse effect on our or Tianwei Yingli’s business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Tianwei Baobian will have significant influence over us if it exercises the subscription right, and Tianwei Baobian’s interests may not be aligned with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders. Furthermore, it is unclear how the pending acquisition by China South Industries Group Corporation of Tianwei Group, the controlling shareholder of Tianwei Baobian, will affect Tianwei Baobian’s approach with respect to the management and operation of Tianwei Yingli.
 
Tianwei Baobian currently owns a 29.89% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, our principal operating entity from which we derive substantially all of our revenue and earnings, and is expected to own a 25.99% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli upon completion of our additional equity contribution to Tianwei Yingli primarily using part of the proceeds from our initial public offering, which would increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 74.01%. Such additional equity contribution is currently pending approval by the relevant PRC authority. Tianwei Baobian has significant influence over Tianwei Yingli through its board representation in Tianwei Yingli and other rights in accordance with the joint venture contract with us and the articles of association of Tianwei Yingli.
 
Tianwei Baobian is entitled to appoint three of the nine directors of Tianwei Yingli. Tianwei Baobian is also entitled to appoint a director to serve as the chairperson of the board of Tianwei Yingli. Tianwei Baobian may have different views and approaches with respect to the management and operation of Tianwei Yingli from those of us. Tianwei Baobian may disagree with us in the management and operation of Tianwei Yingli and may vote against actions that we believe are in the best interest of Tianwei Yingli or us. For example, directors appointed by Tianwei Baobian may vote against matters that require unanimous approval of all directors. Directors appointed by Tianwei Baobian may also hinder or delay adoption of relevant resolutions by not attending a board meeting, thereby preventing achievement of a quorum and forcing the meeting to be postponed for no more than seven days. See “History and Restructuring — Joint Venture Contract — Tianwei Yingli’s Management Structure — Board of Directors”. Due to Tianwei Baobian’s ability to exercise influence over Tianwei Yingli through its appointed directors, and through its other rights under the joint venture contract, any significant deterioration of our relationship or our disagreement with Tianwei Baobian may cause disruption to Tianwei Yingli’s business, which could in turn result in a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Tianwei Baobian may also have disagreement or dispute with us with respect to our respective rights and obligations on matters such as the exercise of Tianwei Baobian’s right to subscribe for ordinary shares newly issued by us in exchange for its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Except in limited circumstances, we may not be able to unilaterally terminate the joint venture contract in the event of such disagreement or dispute even if such termination would be in our best interest. See “History and Restructuring — Joint Venture Contract — Unilateral Termination of the Joint Venture Contract”. Any such disputes may result in costly and time-consuming litigations or other dispute resolution proceedings which may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management and disrupt our business operations.
 
Furthermore, Tianwei Baobian may transfer all or a part of its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli pursuant to the joint venture contract entered into between Tianwei Baobian and us. If we fail to exercise our right of first refusal in accordance with the procedures set forth in the joint venture contract and are thus deemed to have consented to any such proposed transfer by Tianwei Baobian to a third party or if Tianwei Baobian transfers its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to its affiliates, such third party or such Tianwei Baobian’s affiliate will become a holder of Tianwei Yingli’s equity interest. The interests of such third party or such Tianwei Baobian’s affiliate may not be aligned with our interests or the interest of Tianwei Yingli. See “History and Restructuring — Joint Venture Contract — Transfer of Equity Interests in Tianwei Yingli — Right of First Refusal”.
 
In addition, Baoding State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or Baoding SASAC, entered into an agreement in September 2007 to transfer all of its equity interest in Tianwei Group, Tianwei Baobian’s controlling shareholder, to China South Industries Group Corporation, or China South, subject to government approvals. It is unclear how Tianwei Baobian’s business strategy with respect to its shareholding in Tianwei Yingli will change subsequent to the acquisition by China South of Tianwei Group and how such change, if any, will affect the management and operation of Tianwei Yingli.
 
Furthermore, Tianwei Baobian may exercise the subscription right, and if it exercises the subscription right, it will become a significant shareholder of us. Once Tianwei Baobian becomes our shareholder, it will have significant influence over our and Tianwei Yingli’s business, including decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our or Tianwei Yingli’s assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. If Tianwei Baobian becomes our shareholder, its interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of us and might reduce the price of our ADSs.
 
Negative rumors or media coverage of Tianwei Baobian, our affiliates or business partners could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and the price of our ADSs and the notes.
 
There has been negative media coverage concerning the corporate affairs of Tianwei Baobian. For example, in October 2006, there were news articles containing allegations, among others, that Tianwei Baobian had materially overstated its results of operations related to the export sales of Tianwei Yingli’s PV product components and its local tax rates in its published financial statements. Since Tianwei Baobian and we together hold all of Tianwei Yingli’s equity interests, such media coverage, whether or not accurate and whether or not applicable to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and the price of our ADSs and the notes. We cannot assure you that there will not be similar or other negative rumors or media coverage related to Tianwei Baobian, our affiliates or business partners in the future.

If the proposed acquisition of the parent of our minority partner in Tianwei Yingli is consummated, and such acquirer engages in sanctioned activities inconsistent with the laws and policies of other countries, some of our shareholders may divest our shares and prospective investors may decide not to invest in our shares.
 
The United States and other countries maintain economic and other sanctions against several countries and persons engaged in specified activities, such as support of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of terrorism. The parent company of Tianwei Baobian, which owns 29.89% in our principal operating subsidiary Tianwei Yingli, is currently expected to be acquired, subject to government approvals, by China South. North China Industries Corporation, an affiliate of China South, has been designated by the U.S. State Department under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 as engaged in the transfer to Iran of equipment and technology having the potential to make a material contribution to the development of weapons of mass destruction. To the extent the acquisition by China South Industries Group Corporation of the parent company of Tianwei Baobian is consummated and if our affiliates are involved in activities that, if performed by a U.S. person, would be illegal under U.S. sanctions, reputational issues relating to Tianwei Yingli or us may arise. Investors in the United States may choose not to invest in, and to divest any investments in, issuers that are associated even indirectly with sanctioned activities.
 
We have no legal right to prevent Tianwei Baobian from entering into a competing business with us and if Tianwei Baobian chooses to do so, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 
Our joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian and Tianwei Yingli’s articles of association does not impose non-competition restrictions upon Tianwei Baobian. Tianwei Baobian’s current principal business is the manufacture of large electricity transformers but Tianwei Baobian may enter into the PV business directly or through acquisitions of or strategic alliances with an entity that is engaged in PV business. For example, on December 1, 2006, Tianwei Baobian announced that it acquired a controlling interest in a manufacturer of PV products in Tibet. If Tianwei Baobian chooses to further expand into the PV business, including the manufacture of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells or PV modules, it may compete with us for both supply of polysilicon and customers and we may not have any legal right to prevent Tianwei Baobian from doing so. Because of Tianwei Baobian’s familiarity with and its ability to influence Tianwei Yingli’s business, competition from Tianwei Baobian could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The grant of employee share options and other share-based compensation could adversely affect our net income.
 
We adopted our 2006 stock incentive plan in December 2006. Our board of directors approved in April 2007 and our shareholders approved in May 2007 amendment No. 1 to the 2006 stock incentive plan to increase the number of ordinary shares we are authorized to issue under the 2006 stock incentive plan. Under the 2006 stock incentive plan, as amended, we may grant to our directors, employees and consultants up to 2,715,243 restricted shares and options to purchase up to 5,525,414 of our ordinary shares. As of the date of this prospectus, we have granted to six executive officers, four employees and three independent directors options to purchase 1,426,629 ordinary shares in the aggregate and an aggregate of 2,606,060 restricted but unvested shares to DBS Trustee Limited, or the trustee, for the benefit of 69 directors, officers and employees (not including 15,000 restricted but unvested shares granted to the trustee for the benefit of a non-employee). See “Management — 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.” In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Statement No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payments”, or SFAS No. 123R, we account for compensation costs for all share-based awards including share options granted to our directors and employees using a fair-value based method, which may have a material and adverse effect on our reported earnings. Moreover, the additional expenses associated with share-based compensation may

31

Table of Contents

reduce the attractiveness of such incentive plan to us. However, if we reduce the scope of our stock incentive plan, we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel, as share options are an important tool to recruit and retain qualified and desirable employees.
 
Our results of operations are difficult to predict, and if we do not meet the market expectations, the price of our ADSs and the notes will likely decline.
 
Our results of operations are difficult to predict and have fluctuated from time to time in the past. We expect that our results of operations may continue to fluctuate from time to time in the future. It is possible that our results of operations in some reporting periods will be below market expectations. Our results of operations will be affected by a number of factors as set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview”. If our results of operations for a particular reporting period are lower than the market expectations for such reporting period, investors are likely to react negatively, and as a result, the price of our ADSs and the notes may materially decline.
 
Evaluating our business and prospects may be difficult because of our limited operating history.
 
There is limited historical information available about us upon which you can base your evaluation of our business and prospects. We started selling PV modules in January 2003 and have experienced a high growth rate since then. As a result, our historical results of operations may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business, financial performance and prospects. We may not be able to achieve a similar growth rate in future periods and at higher volumes. Accordingly, you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior periods as an indication of our future performance. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges that we will face as an early-stage company seeking to develop and manufacture new products in a rapidly growing market.
 
Our lack of patent protection inside and outside of China may undermine our competitive position and subject us to intellectual property disputes with third parties, both of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
We do not have, and have not applied for, any patents for our proprietary technologies whether inside or outside of China, and rely primarily on trade secret protections, employment agreements and third party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, these measures provide only limited protection and the actions we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or our other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Policing the unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Also, litigation may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. We cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor. Such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention as well as our other resources away from our business. In addition, we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties. An adverse determination in any such litigation could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects and reputation.
 
We have exported, and expect to continue to export, a substantial portion of our PV products outside China. Because we do not have, and have not applied for, any patents for our proprietary technologies outside of China, it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technologies and obtain patents for such intellectual properties in other jurisdictions, including the countries to which we export our PV modules. If any third parties are successful in obtaining patents for technologies that are substantially

32

Table of Contents

equivalent to or the same as our proprietary technologies in any of our markets before we are and enforce their intellectual property rights against us, our ability to sell products containing the allegedly infringing intellectual property in those markets will be materially and adversely affected. If we are required to stop selling such allegedly infringing products, seek license and pay royalties for the relevant intellectual properties or redesign such products with non-infringing technologies, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
 
We may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to us, could cause us to pay significant damage awards.
 
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to use and develop technology and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. The validity and scope of claims relating to PV technology patents involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analysis and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. The steps we take in our product development to ensure that we are not infringing the existing intellectual property rights of others, such as review of related patents and patent applications prior to our product developments, may not be adequate. While we are not currently aware of any action pending or threatened against us, we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time-consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, to pay ongoing royalties, or to redesign our PV modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our PV modules or the use of our technologies. Protracted litigation could also cause our customers or potential customers to defer or limit their purchase or use of our PV modules until the resolution of such litigation.
 
Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and key technical personnel, and our ability to maintain a skilled labor force. Our business may be materially and adversely affected if we lose their services.
 
Our future success depends substantially on the continued services of our executive officers, especially Liansheng Miao, our chief executive officer, Xiangdong Wang, our vice president, Zhiheng Zhao, our vice president, Zongwei Li, our chief financial officer, Seok Jin Lee, our chief operating officer, Guoxiao Yao, our chief technology officer, Dr. Nabih Cherradi, our vice president and Stuart Branningan, our managing director of Europe. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers. If one or more of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. In addition, if any of our executive officers join a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some of our customers. Each of our executive officers has entered into an employment agreement with us, which contains confidentiality and non-competition provisions. However, if any disputes were to arise between one of our executive officers and us, we cannot assure you of the extent to which such officer’s employment agreement could be enforced in China.
 
Furthermore, recruiting and retaining capable personnel, particularly experienced engineers and technicians familiar with our PV products manufacturing processes, is vital to maintaining the quality of our PV products and to continuously improving our production methods. There is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain qualified technical personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, key technical personnel and our executive officers, our business may be materially and adversely affected.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.
 
We are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such company’s internal control over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. These requirements will first apply to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. Our management may conclude that our internal control over our financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not operating effectively. Our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future.
 
Prior to our initial public offering in June 2007, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, our independent auditors identified a number of significant control deficiencies in our internal control procedures which, in the judgment of our independent auditors, adversely affect our ability to initiate, authorize, record, process and report financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. Specifically, the significant control deficiencies identified by our independent auditors consist of: (i) the lack of clear procedures, timetables, segregation of duty and review in the financial reporting process, (ii) failure to regularly reconcile the balances of accounts receivable and customer prepayments as recorded in our books and records with our customers, (iii) the lack of sub-ledgers to classify sales transactions by customer, (iv) the lack of process and related controls procedures relating to the recognition of accounts payable and reduction of advance payments, (v) failure to properly record all related party transactions and periodically update the list of such transactions and (vi) failure to properly record the transfer of construction-in-progress to fixed assets on our financial statements. None of the significant deficiencies identified by our auditors were, individually or in combination with one another, material weaknesses as described in then effective Auditing Standard No. 2, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial Statements, of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In the past, we also had certain material weaknesses, which have since been remedied other than the remaining significant deficiencies discussed above. In addition, in connection with our preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 included in this registration statement, certain other significant control deficiencies were identified, which consist of (i) the lack of sufficient controls to timely identify related party transactions and obtain proper pre-approval prior to entering into such transactions, (ii) the lack of sufficient internal review on the interim financial statement disclosure, including classification between operating cash flows and investing cash flows, disclosure of the estimated useful life of intangible assets, and disclosure of share-based payments and (iii) the lack of process and related controls procedures related to the accounting of intercompany foreign currency transactions, which resulted in the improper recognition of a RMB 13.5 million foreign currency exchange gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
 
 
In order to remedy the remaining significant deficiencies, we are undertaking several measures to further improve our internal control over financial reporting. We appointed a new chief financial officer and a new financial controller in the fourth quarter of 2006, both of whom have experience with

34

Table of Contents

and knowledge of U.S. GAAP. In October 2006, we hired Protiviti, an outside consulting firm, to review our internal control processes, policies and procedures in order to assist us in identifying weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We plan to provide further training to our financial and accounting staff to enhance their knowledge of U.S. GAAP. We are also adopting and implementing additional policies and procedures, including an enterprise resource planning system, to strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting. We plan to continue to take additional steps to remedy these significant deficiencies in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Controls and Procedures”. If, however, we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our ADSs and the value of the notes. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 
Failure to manage our growth, or otherwise develop appropriate internal organizational structures, internal control environment and risk monitoring and management systems in line with our fast growth could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our business and operations have been expanding rapidly. Significant management resources must be expended to develop and implement appropriate structures for internal organization and information flow, an effective internal control environment and risk monitoring and management systems in line with our fast growth as well as to hire and integrate qualified employees into our organization. It is challenging for us to hire, integrate and retain qualified employees in key areas of operations, such as engineers and technicians who are familiar with the PV industry. In addition, disclosure and other ongoing obligations associated with being a public company further increase the challenges to our finance and accounting team. It is possible that our existing risk monitoring and management system, which recently underwent further development as a result of our fast growth and initial public offering, could prove to be inadequate. If we fail to appropriately develop and implement structures for internal organization and information flow, an effective internal control environment and a risk monitoring and management system, we may not be able to identify unfavorable business trends, administrative oversights or other risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity, potentially significant monetary damages and fines and supervision of our business operations.
 
The failure by us to control the use of, or to restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions in our business operations. Our manufacturing processes generate noise, waste water, gaseous and other industrial wastes and are required to comply with national and local regulations regarding environmental protection. We believe we are currently in compliance with present environmental protection requirements and have all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business as it is presently conducted. However, if more stringent regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of compliance with these new regulations could be substantial. If we fail to comply with any future environmental regulations, we may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. See “PRC Government Regulations — Environmental Regulations”.

The ordinary shares underlying the ADSs you purchase in this offering or receive upon the conversion of the notes could become redeemable by us without your approval.
 
The ordinary shares underlying the ADSs in our issued and outstanding share capital have not been issued and the ordinary shares receivable upon the conversion of the notes will not be issued on the express terms that they are redeemable. However, our board of directors may pass resolutions to allow us to redeem the ordinary shares from the holders and two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of the ordinary shares may approve such variation of share rights. The minority shareholders will not be able to prevent their share rights being varied in such a way and their ordinary shares could become redeemable by us as a result.
 
We have adopted a shareholders rights plan, which, together with the other anti-takeover provisions of our articles of association, could discourage a third party from acquiring us, which could limit our shareholders’ opportunity to sell their shares, including ordinary shares represented by our ADSs, at a premium.
 
On May 11, 2007, we adopted our third amended and restated articles of association, which became effective immediately upon completion of our initial public offering in June 2007. Our current articles of association contain provisions that limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. On October 17, 2007, our board of directors adopted a shareholders rights plan. Under this rights plan, one right was distributed with respect to each of our ordinary shares outstanding at the closing of business on October 26, 2007. These rights entitle the holders to purchase ordinary shares from us at half of the market price at the time of purchase in the event that a person or group obtains ownership of 15% or more of our ordinary shares (including by acquisition of the ADSs representing an ownership interest in the ordinary shares) or enters into an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors).
 
This rights plan and the other anti-takeover provisions of our articles of association could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. Our existing authorized ordinary shares confer on the holders of our ordinary shares equal rights, privileges and restrictions. The shareholders have, by virtue of adoption of our third amended and restated articles of association, authorized the issuance of shares of par value of US$0.01 each without specifying any special rights, privileges and restrictions. Therefore, our board of directors may, without further action by our shareholders, issue our ordinary shares, or issue shares of such class and attach to such shares special rights, privileges or restrictions, which may be different from those associated with our ordinary shares. Preferred shares could also be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue ordinary shares or issue preferred shares, the price of our ADSs and the notes may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected.
 
A simple majority of the holders of our shares who vote at a general meeting may sub-divide any of our shares into shares of a smaller par value and may determine that, among the shares so sub-divided, some of such shares may have preferred or other rights or restrictions that are different from those applicable to other such shares.
 
Under our new articles of association, a simple majority of the holders of our shares who vote at a general meeting may sub-divide any of our shares into shares of a smaller par value than is fixed by our articles of association, subject to the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands, and may by such resolution determine that, among the shares so sub-divided, some of such shares may have preferred or other rights or restrictions that are different from those applicable to the other such shares resulting from the sub-division. Any sub-divided shares will be allocated on a pro-rated basis among the

36

Table of Contents

holders of our shares, and a two-thirds vote of any class of shares having special rights or restrictions as a result of such sub-division will be required to further vary the special rights or restrictions attached to such shares. The purpose of this provision is to give flexibility to the shareholders to vary the share capital by effecting a sub-division and alter the rights attaching to the sub-divided shares in order to facilitate transactions where shareholders provide benefits or contribute assets to the Company in consideration of an enhancement of the rights of their shares rather than an issue of new shares. However, as the minority shareholders will not be able to prevent the majority shareholders from effecting such sub-division and designation of special rights or restrictions, such rights of our majority shareholders may discourage investors making an investment in us, which may have a material adverse effect on the price of our ADSs and the notes.
 
The quorum for the general meeting of our shareholders is one-third of our issued voting shares. Accordingly, shareholder resolutions may be passed without the presence of the majority of our shareholders in person or by proxy.
 
The quorum required for the general meeting of our shareholders is two shareholders entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy or, if the shareholder is a corporation, by its duly authorized representative representing not less than one-third in nominal value of our total issued voting shares. Therefore, subject to obtaining the requisite approval from a majority of the shareholders so present, a shareholder resolution may be passed at our shareholder meetings without the presence of the majority of our shareholders present in person or by proxy. Such rights by the holders of the minority of our shares may discourage investors from making an investment in us, which may have a material adverse effect on the price of our ADSs and the notes.
 
If a poll is not demanded at our shareholder meetings, voting will be by show of hands and shares will not be proportionately represented.
 
Voting at any of our shareholder meetings is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded. A poll may be demanded by the chairperson of the meeting, or by at least three shareholders present in person or by proxy, or by any shareholder or shareholders present in person or by proxy holding at least 10% of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting, or by a shareholder or shareholders present in person or by proxy holding shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on the shares conferring that right. If a poll is demanded, each shareholder present in person or by proxy will have one vote for each ordinary share registered in his name. If a poll is not demanded, voting will be by show of hands and each shareholder present in person or by proxy will have one vote regardless of the number of shares registered in his name. In the absence of a poll, shares will therefore not be proportionately represented.
 
Our special U.S. counsel is unable to opine as to whether we are a passive foreign investment company.
 
We do not believe that we are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a passive foreign investment company, or a PFIC, and we expect to operate in such a manner so as not to become a PFIC, although there can be no assurance in this regard. However, because the determination of PFIC status requires extensive factual investigation, including ascertaining the fair market value of our assets on a quarterly basis and the character of each item of gross income that we earn, this determination is beyond the scope of legal counsel’s role, and our special U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to our PFIC status and also expresses no opinion with respect to our expectations contained in this paragraph. If we are or become a PFIC, you could be subject to additional U.S. federal income taxes on gain recognized with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares and on certain distributions, plus an interest charge on certain taxes treated as having been deferred under the PFIC rules. Non-corporate U.S. holders will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividends received from us, if we are a PFIC in the taxable year in which such dividends are paid

or in the preceding taxable year. See “Taxation — United States Federal Income Taxation — Passive Foreign Investment Company”.
 
Risks Related to Doing Business in China
 
Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
 
Our business is based in China and some of our sales are made in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:
 
 	• 	the level of government involvement;
 
 	• 	the level of development;
 
 	• 	the growth rate;
 
 	• 	the control of foreign exchange; and
 
 	• 	the allocation of resources.
 
While the Chinese economy has grown significantly in the past 20 years, the growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us.
 
The Chinese economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of the productive assets in China is still owned by the PRC government. The continued control of these assets and other aspects of the national economy by the PRC government could materially and adversely affect our business. The PRC government also exercises significant control over Chinese economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Efforts by the PRC government to slow the pace of growth of the Chinese economy could result in decreased capital expenditure by solar energy users, which in turn could reduce demand for our products.
 
Any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth and the level of renewable energy investments and expenditures in China, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our businesses.
 
Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We are incorporated in Cayman Islands and are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China and, in particular, laws applicable to Sino-foreign equity joint venture companies and wholly foreign owned companies. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of

foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
 
A new PRC rule on mergers and acquisitions may subject us to sanctions, fines and other penalties and affect our future business growth through acquisition of complementary business.
 
On August 8, 2006, six PRC government and regulatory authorities, including the PRC Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM and the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, promulgated a rule entitled “Provisions regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors”, or the New M&A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006. The New M&A Rule, among other things, requires that an offshore specific purpose vehicle, or SPV, formed for the listing purpose through acquisition of PRC domestic entity and controlled by PRC residents should obtain approval from the CSRC prior to publicly listing its securities on an overseas stock market. Based on consultation with the International Department of the CSRC regarding its interpretation of the New M&A Rule, our PRC counsel, Fangda Partners, advised us that the CSRC approval was not required for our initial public offering, the listing of our ADSs on the NYSE or this offering. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government agency, including the MOFCOM or other applicable departments of the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as our PRC counsel. If the CSRC or other PRC regulatory body subsequently determines that the CSRC’s approval was required for our initial public offering, the listing of our ADSs on the NYSE or this offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our initial public offering and the convertible note offering into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs and the value of the notes.
 
The New M&A Rule also established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. In the future, we may grow our business in part by acquiring complementary businesses, although we do not have any plans to do so at this time. Complying with the requirements of the New M&A Rule to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit the completion of such transactions, which could affect or ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.
 
Recent PRC regulations relating to overseas investment by PRC residents may restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities and adversely affect the implementation of our strategy as well as our business and prospects.
 
In 2005, the SAFE issued a number of rules regarding offshore investments by PRC residents. The rule currently in effect, the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Return Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted Via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, known as SAFE Notice 75, was issued in October 2005 and the complementation procedures of such rules have been further clarified by Circular No. 106 issued by SAFE on May 29, 2007. SAFE Notice 75 requires PRC residents to register with and/or receive approvals from the SAFE in connection with certain offshore investment activities. Since we are a Cayman Islands company that is controlled by Yingli Power Holding Company Ltd., whose controlling

39

Table of Contents

shareholder is Mr. Liansheng Miao, our chairperson and chief executive officer and a PRC resident, Mr. Miao is subject to the registration requirements imposed by SAFE Notice 75.
 
Mr. Miao made the requisite SAFE registration with respect to his investment in Yingli Power Holding Company Ltd. and us in August 2006. After completion of our initial public offering, Mr. Miao submitted an application for additional amendment to his SAFE registration in connection with our initial public offering in June 2007. Within 30 days of this offering, Mr. Miao will be required to submit an application for additional amendment to his SAFE registration in connection with this offering and he has advised us that he intends to submit this application. We have requested our other beneficial owners who are PRC residents to make the necessary applications and filings in connection with this offering as required under the SAFE Notice 75 and its implementing rules. However, we cannot assure you that all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents will comply with our request to apply for or obtain any registrations or approvals required under these or other regulations or legislation.
 
If Mr. Miao or any of our other beneficial owners who are PRC residents fails to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Notice 75, Mr. Miao or such beneficial owner who is a PRC resident could be subject to fines and legal penalties and Tianwei Yingli could face restrictions on its foreign currency exchange activities, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its equity interest holders and Tianwei Yingli’s ability to receive capital from us. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, acquisition opportunities, financing alternatives and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.
 
See “PRC Government Regulations — Regulation of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions”.
 
A newly enacted PRC tax law could increase the enterprise income tax rate applicable to our principal subsidiaries in China, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
In accordance with Income Tax Law of China for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises, or the FIE Income Tax Law, and the related implementing rules, as a foreign invested enterprise primarily engaged in manufacturing, Tianwei Yingli is entitled to a two-year exemption from the enterprise income tax for its first two profitable years following its conversion into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company, which are currently expected to be 2007 and 2008 for purposes of relevant PRC tax regulations. Tianwei Yingli will thereafter be entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of that is half of the rate that would otherwise be applicable for the succeeding three years, or until 2011. Yingli Green Energy would also be exempted from the withholding tax on dividends it receives from Tianwei Yingli.
 
On March 16, 2007, the PRC Enterprise Income Tax law, or EIT Law, was enacted, and will become effective on January 1, 2008 when the FIE Income Tax Law and the Enterprise Income Tax Provisional Regulations of the PRC are scheduled to expire. The EIT Law adopts a uniform tax rate of 25% for all enterprises (including foreign-invested enterprises) and revokes the current tax exemption, reduction and preferential treatments which are applicable only to foreign-invested enterprises. However, any enterprises established before the promulgation of the EIT Law that are entitled to preferential tax treatments for a fixed period will continue to be entitled to such preferential tax treatments until the expiration of such period. If the fixed period has not commenced because of tax losses, it shall be deemed to commence in 2008. In addition, certain qualified high-technology enterprises may still benefit from a preferential tax rate of 15% under the EIT Law if they meet the definition of “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State” to be set forth in the more detailed implementing rules when they are adopted. As a result, if Tianwei Yingli qualifies as “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State”, it will continue to benefit from a preferential tax rate of 15%. Otherwise, the applicable tax rate of Tianwei Yingli may increase from its existing tax rate of 15% to the unified tax rate of 25% under the EIT Law, in accordance with more

40

Table of Contents

detailed implementing rules to be adopted in the future. As Yingli China was established on October 16, 2007, Yingli China’s income tax rate will be 25% beginning on January 1, 2008, unless Yingli China qualifies as a “high and new technology enterprise strongly supported by the State”, in which case it will benefit from a preferential tax rate of 15% subject to the more detailed implementing rules to be adopted in the future.
 
Moreover, the EIT Law provides that an income tax at a maximum rate of 20% will normally be applicable to dividends payable to foreign investors and does not specifically exempt withholding tax on dividends payable to foreign investors. Although the EIT Law provides for the possibility of withholding tax exemption or reduction for China source income, the details have not been published.
 
If Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China fails to qualify as a “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State” and therefore is not entitled to a preferential tax rate of 15%, or if withholding tax imposed on the dividends we receive from Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
 
We may be deemed a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT law and be subject to PRC taxation on our worldwide income.
 
Under the EIT Law, enterprises established under the laws of foreign countries or regions whose “de facto management bodies” are located within the PRC territory are considered resident enterprises and will normally be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income, but the EIT Law does not define the term “de facto management bodies”. Substantially all of our management is currently located in the PRC, and if they remain located in the PRC after the effective date of the EIT Law, Yingli Green Energy may be considered a resident enterprise and therefore be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The tax consequences of the “resident enterprise” treatment are currently unclear, as they will depend on regulations that have not yet been issued that would implement the EIT Law, and on local tax authorities’ ability to follow such regulations in tax administration. See “Dividends payable by us to our foreign investors may become subject to withholding taxes under PRC tax laws” and “Gains on the sales of our shares or ADSs may become subject to PRC income taxes” below.
 
Dividends payable by us to our foreign investors may become subject to withholding taxes under PRC tax laws.
 
Under the EIT Law, dividends payable to foreign investors which are “derived from sources within the PRC” may be subject to income tax at the rate of 20% by way of withholding. Since we are a holding company and substantially all of our income will come from dividends that we receive from our PRC subsidiaries, dividends that we declare from such income may be deemed “derived from sources within the PRC” for purposes of the EIT Law and therefore subject to a 20% withholding tax. While the EIT Law stipulates that such taxes may be exempted or reduced, no rules or guidance implementing the EIT Law have been issued yet, and it is unclear under what circumstances, and to what extent, such tax would be exempted or reduced.
 
The EIT Law also provides that dividend income between “qualified resident enterprises” is exempted income, which may imply that dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiaries would be exempt from tax, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such treatment for dividends paid to us by our PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, if we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT law, a foreign investor in us may be able to claim the benefits of any income tax treaty between his or her resident country and China. We cannot assure you, however, that treaty benefits will be available to you (for example with respect to the withholding tax rate on dividends) even if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise.
 
If we are required under the EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our foreign shareholders and ADSs holders, the value of your investment in our ADSs may be materially and adversely affected.

41

Table of Contents

 
Gains on the sales of our shares or our ADSs may become subject to PRC income taxes.
 
Under the EIT Law, our foreign enterprise shareholders and enterprise ADSs holders may be subject to income tax at a maximum rate of 20% upon any gains they realize from the transfer of their shares, or ADSs, if such income is regarded as income from “sources within the PRC”. What will constitute “sources within the PRC” and whether or not there will be any exemption or reduction in taxation for our foreign corporate investors, however, is unclear since no rule or guidance concerning the new tax law has been issued yet. If our foreign shareholders and ADSs holders are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfers of their shares or ADSs, the value of your investment in our ADSs may be materially and adversely affected.
 
The PRC tax treatment of convertible notes is unclear, and whether the disposition or conversion of the notes would be taxable to the holders of the notes depends on PRC regulations that, although imminent, have not been issued.
 
If we are considered a PRC “resident enterprise”, PRC tax law may apply to the conversion of the notes into ADSs and to the disposition of the notes by noteholders. Currently there are no PRC tax rules that specifically address the treatment of convertible notes, and whether the conversion of the notes into our ADSs upon the exercise of conversion rights is a taxable transaction is unclear, as are the tax consequences to us and to noteholders if such conversion were taxable. In addition, whether any gain upon the disposition of the notes (whether through conversion into ADSs upon conversion or otherwise) would be treated as PRC source income is uncertain, although regulations to be issued in December 2007 by the State Council to implement the EIT Law may provide guidance on this point.
 
We rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our principal operating subsidiaries, including Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China, and limitations on their ability to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We are a holding company, and we rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our principal operating subsidiaries, including Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China, for our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, service any debt we may incur and pay our operating expenses. If Tianwei Yingli or Yingli China incurs debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.
 
As entities established in China, Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China are subject to certain limitations with respect to dividend payments. PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in China. Following its conversion into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture, Tianwei Yingli is also required to set aside each year a percentage, as decided by its board of directors, of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to its reserve fund, enterprise development fund and employee bonus and welfare fund. As of September 30, 2007, such restricted reserves of Tianwei Yingli amounted to RMB 31.2 million (US$4.2 million) and our accumulated profits that were unrestricted and were available for distribution amounted to RMB 675.7 million (US$90.2 million). Yingli China is also required to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to its reserve fund and employee bonus and welfare fund. These reserve funds may not be distributed as cash dividends. In addition, if any of our PRC subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Limitations on the ability of Tianwei Yingli or Yingli China to pay dividends to us could adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. Accordingly, if for any of the above or other reasons, we do not receive dividends from Tianwei Yingli or Yingli China, our liquidity, financial condition and ability to make dividend distributions to our shareholders will be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, under the EIT Law, dividends from our PRC subsidiaries to us may be subject to a withholding tax rate of up to 20%, subject to exemptions or reductions granted by the State Council, unless we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise’’. See “— We may be deemed a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT Law and be subject to PRC taxation on our worldwide income”. Since the implementing rules of the EIT Law have not been issued, it remains unclear as to whether we would be able to obtain exemptions from PRC withholding taxes for dividends distributed to us by our PRC subsidiaries.
 
Fluctuation in the value of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on your Investment.
 
The change in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, Euro and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political and economic conditions. On July 21, 2005, in a reversal of a long-standing policy, the PRC government announced that Renminbi would be permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of specified foreign currencies. Since this announcement, the Renminbi has appreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 5.7% as of December 31, 2006 and approximately 11.7% as of December 7, 2007. While international reactions to the Renminbi revaluation have generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible foreign currency policy, which could result in further and more significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. In addition, as we rely entirely on dividends paid to us by Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China, any significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and financial condition as well as the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADSs in foreign currency. In addition, to the extent Tianwei Yingli needs to convert U.S. dollars it received from our initial public offering or that Yingli China needs to convert U.S. dollars it receives from the convertible note offering in the form of capital contribution or shareholder loan from us into Renminbi for its operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount it receives from the conversion. Conversely, if Tianwei Yingli or Yingli China decides to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making dividend payments on our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount it distributes to us.
 
Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive dividends from Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China and their ability to obtain overseas financing.
 
Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China may convert a portion of Renminbi held by it into foreign currencies to meet its foreign currency obligations, including, among others, payments of dividends declared, if any, in respect of our ordinary shares. Under China’s existing foreign exchange regulations, Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China are able to pay dividends in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, we cannot assure you that the PRC government will not take measures in the future to restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions, including payment of dividends.
 
Foreign exchange transactions for capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investments, by Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of PRC governmental authorities, including the SAFE. In particular, if Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China borrows foreign currency-denominated loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with the local offices of the SAFE. These limitations could affect their ability to obtain additional equity or debt funding that is denominated in foreign currencies.

PRC regulation of direct investment and loans by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or limit us from using the proceeds of our initial public offering or the convertible note offering to make additional capital contributions or loans to our PRC subsidiaries.
 
Any capital contributions or loans that we, as an offshore entity, make to Tianwei Yingli or Yingli China, our PRC subsidiaries, including from the proceeds of our initial public offering or the convertible note offering, are subject to PRC regulations. For example, any of our loans to our PRC subsidiaries cannot exceed the difference between the total amount of investment our PRC subsidiaries are approved to make under relevant PRC laws and the respective registered capital of our PRC subsidiaries, and must be registered with the local branch of the SAFE as a procedural matter. In addition, our capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries must be approved by MOFCOM or its local counterpart. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these approvals on a timely basis, or at all. If we fail to obtain such approvals, our ability to make equity contributions or provide loans to our PRC subsidiaries or to fund their operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect their liquidity and its ability to fund its working capital and expansion projects and meet its obligations and commitments.
 
In addition, our capital contributions and, in limited circumstances, loans, to Tianwei Yingli are also subject to approvals by Tianwei Baobian, the holder of the minority equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. See “History and Restructuring — Joint Venture Contract — Increase or Reduction of Tianwei Yingli’s Registered Capital”.
 
All employee participants in our existing stock option plans who are PRC citizens may be required to register with SAFE. We may also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional option plans for our directors and employees under PRC law.
 
On March 28, 2007, SAFE issued the Operating Procedures on Administration of Foreign Exchange regarding PRC Individuals’ Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Stock Option Plan of Overseas Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Rule. It is not clear whether the Stock Option Rule covers any type of equity compensation plans or incentive plans which provide for the grant of ordinary share options or authorize the grant of restricted share awards. For any plans which are so covered and are adopted by an overseas listed company, the Stock Option Rule requires the employee participants who are PRC citizens to register with SAFE or its local branch within ten days of the beginning of each quarter. In addition, the Stock Option Rule also requires the employee participants who are PRC citizens to follow a series of requirements on making necessary applications for foreign exchange purchase quota, opening special bank account and filings with SAFE or its local branch before they exercise their stock option.
 
The Stock Option Rule has not yet been made publicly available or formally promulgated by SAFE, but SAFE has begun enforcing its provisions. Nonetheless, it is not predictable whether it will continue to enforce this rule or adopt additional or different requirements with respect to equity compensation plans or incentive plans.
 
We have contacted the Baoding branch of SAFE and attempted to submit documents prepared for their registration. The officials at the local SAFE branch in Baoding acknowledged receipt of such documents but refused to indicate whether they would effect the registration under the Stock Option Rule. We are seeking further guidance from the relevant government authorities and will promptly take all steps to comply with their requirements when they become available. To date, we have not received any notice from SAFE or its local branch in Baoding regarding any legal sanctions to us or our employees. If it is determined that our employee stock option plan is subject to the Stock Option Rule, failure to comply with such provisions may subject us and the participants of our employee stock option plan who are PRC citizens to fines and legal sanctions and prevent us from further granting options under our employee stock option plan to our employees, which could adversely affect our business operations.

We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks.
 
Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of avian flu, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, or another epidemic or outbreak in China or elsewhere in the world. China reported a number of cases of SARS in April 2003. Since 2004, there have been reports on the occurrences of avian flu in various parts of China, including several confirmed human cases. Any prolonged recurrence of avian flu, SARS or other adverse public health developments in China or other key markets of us may have a material adverse effect on our business operations. These could affect our ability to travel or export our products outside of China or import raw materials, as well as temporary closure of our manufacturing facilities. Such closures or travel or shipment restrictions would severely disrupt our business and operations and adversely affect our results of operations. We have not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak of avian flu, SARS or any other epidemic.
 
Risks Related to Our ADSs and the ADS Offering
 
The market price for our ADSs has been volatile.
 
The market price for our ADSs has been and will continue to be highly volatile. Since our ADSs became listed on the NYSE on June 8, 2007, the closing prices of our ADSs have ranged from US$10.50 to US$37.85 per ADS, and the last reported trading price on December 7, 2007 was US$31.91 per ADS. The price of our ADSs may continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following:
 
 	• 	announcements of technological or competitive developments;
 
 	• 	regulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our customers or our competitors;
 
 	• 	announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors;
 
 	• 	announcements of studies and reports relating to the conversion efficiencies of our products or those of our competitors;
 
 	• 	actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations;
 
 	• 	changes in financial projections or estimates about our financial or operational performance by securities research analysts;
 
 	• 	changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other PV technology companies;
 
 	• 	addition or departure of our executive officers and key research personnel;
 
 	• 	release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares or ADSs; and
 
 	• 	sales or perceived sales of additional ordinary shares or ADSs.
 
In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material adverse effect on the market price of our ADSs.
 
Substantial future sales or perceived sales of our ADSs in the public market could cause the price of our ADSs to decline.
 
Sales of our ADSs in the public market after this offering, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. We currently have 126,923,609 ordinary shares outstanding. All ADSs sold in this offering will be freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The ordinary shares held by our Series A and Series B shareholders, except for those who are selling in this offering, are, subject to the applicable requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, available for sale. Substantially all of the remaining ordinary shares outstanding after this offering will be available for sale, upon the expiration of the 90-day lock-up period beginning from the date of this

45

Table of Contents

prospectus applicable to our directors, officers and the selling shareholders in the offering, subject to volume and other restrictions as applicable under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. See “Shares Eligible for Future Sale”. Any or all of these shares (other than those held by certain option holders) may be released prior to expiration of the lock-up period at the discretion of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC. To the extent shares are released before the expiration of the lock-up period and these shares are sold into the market, the market price of our ADSs could decline.
 
Holders of ADSs have fewer rights than shareholders and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights.
 
Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights of our shareholders and may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. As a holder of ADSs, you will not be treated as one of our shareholders and you will not have shareholder rights. Instead, the depositary will be treated as the holder of the shares underlying your ADSs. However, you may exercise some of the shareholders’ rights through the depositary, and you will have the right to withdraw the shares underlying your ADSs from the deposit facility as described in “Description of American Depositary Shares — Deposit and Withdrawal” and “Description of American Depositary Shares — Your Right to Receive the Shares Underlying Your ADRs”.
 
Under our current articles of association, the minimum notice period required to convene a general meeting will be ten days. When a general meeting is convened, you may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders’ meeting to permit you to withdraw your ordinary shares to allow you to cast your vote with respect to any specific matter. In addition, the depositary and its agents may not be able to send voting instructions to you or carry out your voting instructions in a timely manner. We plan to make all reasonable efforts to cause the depositary to extend voting rights to you in a timely manner, but we cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote your ADSs. Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and you may lack recourse if your ADSs are not voted as you requested. In addition, in your capacity as an ADS holder, you will not be able to call a shareholder meeting.
 
The depositary for our ADSs will give us a discretionary proxy to vote our ordinary shares underlying your ADSs if you do not vote at shareholders’ meetings, except in limited circumstances, which could adversely affect your interests.
 
Under the deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will give us a discretionary proxy to vote our ordinary shares underlying your ADSs at shareholders’ meetings if you do not vote, unless:
 
 	• 	we have failed to provide the depositary with the notice of meeting and related voting materials at least 30 days prior to the date of such shareholders’ meeting;
 
 	• 	we have instructed the depositary that we do not wish a discretionary proxy to be given;
 
 	• 	we have informed the depositary that there is substantial opposition as to a matter to be voted on at the meeting;
 
 	• 	a matter to be voted on at the meeting would have a material adverse effect on shareholders; or
 
 	• 	voting at the meeting is made on a show of hands.
 
The effect of this discretionary proxy is that you cannot prevent our ordinary shares underlying your ADSs from being voted, absent the situations described above, and it may make it more difficult for shareholders to influence our management. Holders of our ordinary shares are not subject to this discretionary proxy.

You may not receive distributions on our ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical to make them available to you.
 
The depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian for our ADSs receives on our ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of our ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, the depositary is not responsible if it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, it would be unlawful to make a distribution to a holder of ADSs if it consists of securities that require registration under the Securities Act but that are not properly registered or distributed pursuant to an applicable exemption from registration. The depositary is not responsible for making a distribution available to any holders of ADSs if any government approval or registration required for such distribution cannot be obtained after reasonable efforts are made by the depositary. We have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of our ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of our ADSs. This means that you may not receive the distributions we make on our ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to you. These restrictions may have a material and adverse effect on the value of your ADSs.
 
You may be subject to limitations on transfers of your ADSs.
 
Your ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason.
 
As a holder of our ADSs, your right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings and you may not receive cash dividends if it is impractical to make them available to you.
 
We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make rights available to you in the United States unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. Also, under the deposit agreement, the depositary bank will not make rights available to you unless the distribution to ADS holders of both the rights and any related securities are either registered under the Securities Act, or exempted from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, as a holder of our ADSs, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings.
 
In addition, the depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on our ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, the depositary may, at its discretion, decide that it is inequitable or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, the depositary may determine that it is not practicable to distribute certain property through the mail, or that the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them. In these cases, the depositary may decide not to distribute such property and you will not receive such distribution.

We are a Cayman Islands company and, because judicial precedent regarding the rights of shareholders is more limited under Cayman Islands law than that under U.S. law, you may have less protection for your shareholder rights than you would under U.S. law.
 
Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, the Cayman Islands Companies Law and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as that from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws than the United States. In addition, some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands.
 
As a result of all of the above, shareholders of a Cayman Islands company may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. For example, contrary to the general practice in most corporations incorporated in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not require that shareholders approve sales of all or substantially all of a company’s assets. The limitations described above will also apply to the depositary who is treated as the holder of the shares underlying your ADSs.
 
You may have difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us.
 
We are a Cayman Islands company and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Substantially all of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands or the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state. In addition, it is uncertain whether such Cayman Islands or PRC courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman Islands or the PRC against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state. See “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities”.
 
We have not determined any specific use for a portion of the net proceeds to us from the convertible note offering and we may use such portion of the net proceeds in ways with which you may not agree.
 
We have not allocated a portion of the net proceeds to us from the convertible note offering to be used for any specific purpose. Rather, our management will have considerable discretion in the application of such portion of the net proceeds received by us. See “Use of Proceeds”. You will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether such proceeds are being used appropriately. You must rely on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds we receive from the convertible note offering. Such proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not improve our profitability or increase our share price and may also be placed in investments that do not produce income or that may lose value.

We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.
 
As a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur a significantly higher level of legal, accounting and other expenses than we did as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NYSE, requires changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.
 
Risks Related to the Notes and the Convertible Note Offering
 
The notes are unsecured, are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables.
 
The notes are unsecured, are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables. As of September 30, 2007, our subsidiaries had approximately US$189.7 million of indebtedness and other obligations to which the notes would be structurally subordinated. All of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries has guaranteed or otherwise become obligated with respect to the notes. Our right to receive assets from any of our subsidiaries upon its liquidation or reorganization, and the right of holders of the notes to participate in those assets, is structurally subordinated to claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. Even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of that subsidiary senior to that held by us. Furthermore, any payments to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of our subsidiaries and various business considerations. Statutory, contractual or other restrictions may also limit our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make distributions, loans or advances to us. For these reasons, we may not have access to any assets or cash flows of our subsidiaries to make payments on the notes.
 
We have made only limited covenants in the indenture for the notes, and these limited covenants may not protect your investment.
 
The indenture for the notes does not:
 
 	• 	require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flows or liquidity and, accordingly, does not protect holders of the notes in the event that we experience significant adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations;
 
 	• 	limit our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness which would effectively rank senior to the notes;
 
 	• 	limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness or indebtedness that is equal in right of payment to the notes;
 
 	• 	restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to issue securities that would be senior to the ordinary shares of our subsidiaries held by us;
 
 	• 	restrict our ability to repurchase our securities;
 
 	• 	restrict our ability to pledge our assets or those of our subsidiaries; or

49

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	restrict our ability to make investments or to pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our ordinary shares, including ADSs or other securities ranking junior to the notes.
 
Furthermore, the indenture for the notes contains only limited protections in the event of a change in control. We could engage in many types of transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, which could substantially affect our capital structure and the value of the notes, our ordinary shares and our ADSs but may not constitute a “fundamental change” that permits holders to require us to repurchase their notes. For these reasons, you should not consider the covenants in the indenture or the repurchase features of the notes as a significant factor in evaluating whether to invest in the notes.
 
Our right to elect full or partial cash settlement in lieu of delivering ADSs in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the notes may have adverse consequences.
 
Our right to elect full or partial cash settlement in lieu of delivering ADSs in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the notes as described under “Description of the Notes — Conversion Rights — Settlement upon Conversion” may:
 
 	• 	result in holders receiving no ADSs upon conversion or fewer ADSs relative to the conversion value of the notes;
 
 	• 	delay holders’ receipt of the proceeds upon conversion; and
 
 	• 	subject holders to market risk before receiving any ADSs upon conversion.
 
If the notes become convertible and are converted, and if we elect full or partial cash settlement, holders will receive upon conversion, cash or a combination of cash and ADSs based on several determinants including the average daily VWAP of our ADSs during the “cash settlement averaging period,” which, other than in some instances, generally means the 20 consecutive VWAP trading days that begins on, and includes, the second VWAP trading day after the conversion date, which is the day the notes are duly surrendered for conversion.
 
If we elect full or partial cash settlement upon conversion, settlement of our conversion obligation will generally occur on the fifth scheduled trading day following the final VWAP trading day of the related cash settlement averaging period, which will be at least 27 business days after the conversion date holders tender their notes for conversion. In addition, because the consideration due upon conversion is based in part on the trading prices of our ADSs during the cash settlement averaging period, any decrease in the price of our ADSs after you tender your notes for conversion may significantly decrease the value of the consideration you receive.
 
The increase in the conversion rate applicable to notes that holders convert in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may not adequately compensate you for the lost option time value of your notes that result from that fundamental change.
 
If a make-whole fundamental change occurs, we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate applicable to holders who convert their notes within a specified time frame. The amount of the increase in the conversion rate depends on the date when the make-whole fundamental change becomes effective and the applicable price described in this prospectus. See “Description of the Notes — Conversion Rights — Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change”. Although the increase in the conversion rate is designed to compensate you for the lost option time value of your notes as a result of the make-whole fundamental change, the increase in the conversion rate is only an approximation of the lost value and may not adequately compensate you for the loss. In addition, you will not be entitled to an increased conversion rate if the applicable price is greater than US$       per ADSs or less than US$       per ADS (in each case, subject to adjustment).

50

Table of Contents

Moreover, a holder may not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the third business day after the effective date of the make-whole fundamental change, or even later, which could be a significant period of time after the date the holder has surrendered its notes for conversion. Our obligation to increase the conversion rate as described above also could be considered a penalty, in which case its enforceability would be subject to general principles of reasonableness of economic remedies.
 
We may not have the ability to raise the funds to purchase the notes on the purchase dates upon a fundamental change.
 
If a fundamental change occurs, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. We may not have sufficient funds for any required repurchase of the notes or required payment of principal return or interest, and we may have to refinance our credit facilities in order to make payments under the notes. In addition, the terms of any borrowing agreements which we may enter into from time to time may require early repayment of borrowings under circumstances similar to those constituting a fundamental change. These agreements may also make our repurchase of notes an event of default under such agreements. If we fail to pay interest on the notes or repurchase the notes when required, we will be in default under the indenture governing the notes. See “Description of the Notes — Purchase of Notes by Us at the Option of the Holder” and “Description of the Notes — Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of A Fundamental Change”.
 
You may not be able to convert your notes except during limited periods, and the value of the notes could be less than the value of the ADSs into which your notes could otherwise be converted.
 
Except during the limited periods described under “Description of the Notes”, your notes are convertible into, at our election, cash, our ADSs or a combination thereof only if specified conditions are met. These conditions may not be met. If these conditions for conversion are not met, you will not be able to convert your notes and you may not be able to receive (whether in the form of ADSs or cash) the value of the ADSs into which the notes would otherwise be convertible. In addition, for these and other reasons, the trading price of the notes could be substantially less than the conversion value of the notes.
 
Future issuances of ordinary shares or ADSs may depress the trading price of our ADSs and the notes.
 
Any issuance of equity securities after this offering, including the issuance of ADSs upon conversion of the notes, could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, including holders who have received ADSs upon conversion of their notes, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our ADSs and the notes. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons.
 
Because your right to require repurchase of the notes is limited, the market price of the notes may decline if we enter into a transaction that is not a fundamental change under the Indenture.
 
The term “fundamental change” is limited and may not include every event that might cause the market price of the notes to decline or result in a decrease in creditworthiness of the notes. The term “fundamental change” does not apply to certain transactions in which at least 90% of the consideration paid for our ordinary shares in a merger or similar transaction is publicly traded common stock, shares or ADSs. Our obligation to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change may not preserve the value of the notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction. See “Description of the Notes — Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of A Fundamental Change”.

If you hold notes, you are not entitled to any rights with respect to our ADSs, but you are subject to all changes made with respect to our ADSs.
 
If you hold notes, you are not entitled to any rights with respect to our ADSs (including, without limitation, voting rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our ADSs), but you are subject to all changes affecting the ADSs. You will only be entitled to rights on the ADSs if and when we deliver ADSs to you in exchange for your notes. For example, in the event that an amendment is proposed to our certificate of incorporation or articles of association requiring shareholder approval and the record date for determining the shareholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to delivery of the ADSs, you will not be entitled to vote on the amendment, although you will nevertheless be subject to any resulting changes in the powers, preferences or special rights that affect our ADSs.
 
If an active and liquid trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price of the notes may decline and you may be unable to sell your notes.
 
The notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no public market, and no active trading market might ever develop. If the notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, the price, and volatility in the price, of our ADSs, our performance and other factors. In addition, we do not know whether an active trading market will develop for the notes. To the extent that an active trading market does not develop, the liquidity and trading prices for the notes may be harmed.
 
We have no plans to list the notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. We have been advised by the underwriters that they presently intend to make a market in the notes. However, the underwriters are not obligated to do so. Any market-making activity, if initiated, may be discontinued at any time, for any reason or for no reason, without notice. If the underwriters cease to act as the market makers for the notes, we cannot assure you another firm or person will make a market in the notes.
 
The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, our results of operations and financial condition, the market for similar securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes and other factors. An active or liquid trading market for the notes may not develop, and you may be unable to resell your notes or may only be able to sell them at a substantial discount.
 
Provisions of the notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.
 
Certain provisions of the notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes in integral multiples of US$1,000. We may also be required to issue additional ADSs upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental changes.

The forward-looking statements relate to our current expectations and views of future events and are contained principally in the sections entitled “Prospectus Summary”, “Risk Factors”, “Use of Proceeds”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business”. These statements relate to events that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those listed under “Risk Factors”, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
 
In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or other similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements relating to:
 
 	• 	our expectations regarding the worldwide demand for electricity and the market for solar energy;
 
 	• 	our beliefs regarding the effects of environmental regulation, lack of infrastructure reliability and long-term fossil fuel supply constraints;
 
 	• 	our beliefs regarding the inability of traditional fossil fuel-based generation technologies to meet the demand for electricity;
 
 	• 	our beliefs regarding the importance of environmentally friendly power generation;
 
 	• 	our expectations regarding governmental support for the deployment of solar energy;
 
 	• 	our beliefs regarding the acceleration of adoption of solar technologies;

This prospectus also contains data related to the PV market worldwide and in China. These market data, including market data from Solarbuzz, a solar energy research and consulting firm, and PV Status Report by the European Commission, include projections that are based on a number of assumptions. The PV market may not grow at the rates projected by the market data, or at all. The failure of the PV market to grow at the projected rates may have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our ADSs or the value of the notes. In addition, the rapidly changing nature of the PV market subjects any projections or estimates relating to the growth prospects or future condition of our market to significant uncertainties. If any one or more of the assumptions underlying the market data turns out to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these assumptions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
 
The forward-looking statements made in this prospectus relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this prospectus. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this prospectus and the documents that we refer to in this prospectus and have filed as exhibits to the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.

USE OF PROCEEDS
 
We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the convertible note offering of approximately US$144.8 million, after deducting underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds we receive for the following purposes:
 
 	• 	approximately US$100 million to make an equity contribution to our newly formed subsidiary, Yingli China, to fund part of its planned construction of manufacturing capacity for the production of 200 megawatts for each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules by the end of 2009; and
 
 	• 	the remaining amount for other general corporate purposes, such as prepayments for polysilicon supply or potential strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, products and technologies that we believe will complement our current operations and strategies, although we are not currently in discussion with any parties regarding any such transaction.
 
We have not yet finalized all of our anticipated expenditures and therefore cannot provide definitive estimates of the exact amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds we will receive from the convertible note offering. Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate, we may determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for different purposes.
 
Pending the use of our net proceeds, we intend to place the net proceeds in short-term bank deposits.
 
Since we are an offshore holding company, we may need to make capital contributions or loans to our PRC subsidiaries such that the net proceeds of the offering can be used in the manner described above. Such capital contributions and loans are subject to a number of limitations and approval processes under PRC laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that we can obtain the approvals from the relevant governmental authorities, or complete the registration and filing procedures required to use our net proceeds as described above, in each case on a timely basis, or at all. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — PRC regulation of direct investment and loans by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or limit us from using the proceeds of our initial public offering or the convertible note offering to make additional capital contributions or loans to our PRC subsidiaries”.
 
We will not pay to any of our affiliates, other than our subsidiaries, any of the proceeds received by us from the issuance and sale of the notes.
 
We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
 
The following table sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges on a historical basis for the periods indicated. For purposes of determining the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of the total of the following: (i) pre-tax income from continuing operations, (ii) fixed charges, and (iii) amortization of capitalized interest, minus interest capitalized. Fixed charges are defined as the sum of the following: (i) interest expensed and capitalized, and (ii) amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts.

DIVIDEND POLICY
 
Since its incorporation, Yingli Green Energy has never declared or paid any dividends, nor does it have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future.
 
Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to pay dividends, subject, in certain cases, to the approval of our shareholders. Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. If we pay any dividends, we will pay our ADS holders to the same extent as if they were holders of our ordinary shares, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, including the fees and expenses payable under the deposit agreement. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars. See “Description of American Depositary Shares”.
 
As we are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we primarily rely on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries in the PRC, including Tianwei Yingli and Yingli China, for our cash requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, service any debt we may incur and pay our operating expenses. PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Neither the registered capital nor these reserves are distributable as cash dividends. In addition, at the discretion of their respective board of directors, Tianwei Yingli is required to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to its reserve fund, enterprise development fund and employee bonus and welfare fund, and Yingli China is required to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to its reserve fund and employee bonus and welfare fund. These reserve funds may not be distributed as cash dividends either. Further, if any of our PRC subsidiaries incurs debt in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.
 
Under the PRC Income Tax Law for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises currently in effect, any dividends payable by foreign-invested enterprises to non-PRC investors are exempt from any PRC withholding tax. Under the EIT Law which will become effective on January 1, 2008, dividends from our PRC subsidiaries to us may be subject to a withholding tax rate of up to 20%, subject to exemptions or reductions granted by the State Council, unless we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise”.
 
Moreover, the EIT Law and Income Tax Law for Individuals provide that an income tax rate of 20% will normally be applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC investors who are individuals or considered as “non-resident enterprises” which have no establishment inside the PRC, or derive income not substantially connected with their establishments inside the PRC, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC, although such income tax may be subsequently exempted or reduced by the State Council. We are a Cayman Islands holding company and substantially all of our income may be derived from dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries located in the PRC. If we declare dividends on such income, it is unclear whether such dividends will be deemed to be derived from sources within the PRC under the EIT Law and be subject to the 20% income tax. See “Taxation — People’s Republic of China Taxation”.

EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION
 
Our business is primarily conducted in China and a portion of our revenues are denominated in Renminbi. The conversion of Renminbi into U.S. dollars in this prospectus is based on the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of Renminbi as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars and from U.S. dollars to Renminbi in this prospectus were made at a rate of RMB 7.4928 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect as of September 28, 2007. We make no representation that any Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate, the rates stated below, or at all. The PRC government imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of Renminbi into foreign exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade. On December 7, 2007, the noon buying rate was RMB 7.4070 to US$1.00.
 
The following table sets forth information concerning exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar for the periods indicated.

ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES
 
We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands to take advantage of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as:
 
 	• 	political and economic stability;
 
 	• 	an effective judicial system;
 
 	• 	a favorable tax system;
 
 	• 	the absence of exchange control or currency restrictions; and
 
 	• 	the availability of professional and support services.
 
However, certain disadvantages accompany incorporation in the Cayman Islands. These disadvantages include:
 
 	• 	the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides significantly less protection to investors; and
 
 	• 	Cayman Islands companies do not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.
 
Our constituent documents do not contain provisions requiring that disputes, including those arising under the securities laws of the United States, between us, our officers, directors and shareholders, be arbitrated.
 
Substantially all of our current operations are conducted in China, and substantially all of our assets are located in China. A majority of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such persons, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.
 
We have appointed Law Debenture Corporate Services Inc. as our agent to receive service of process with respect to any action brought against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the federal securities laws of the United States or of any state in the United States or any action brought against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of New York under the securities laws of the State of New York.
 
Conyers Dill & Pearman, our counsel as to Cayman Islands law, and Fangda Partners, our counsel as to PRC law, have advised us, respectively, that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands and the PRC, respectively, would:
 
 	• 	recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States; or
 
 	• 	entertain original actions brought in each respective jurisdiction against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.
 
Conyers Dill & Pearman has further advised us that the courts of the Cayman Islands would recognize as a valid judgment, a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in the federal or state courts in the United States under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) and would give a judgment based thereon provided that (i) such courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment, (ii) such courts did not contravenue the rules of natural justice of the Cayman Islands, (iii) such judgment was not obtained by fraud, (iv) the

61

Table of Contents

enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands, (v) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands, and (vi) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands.
 
Fangda Partners has advised us further that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments, which do not otherwise violate basic legal principles, state sovereignty, safety or social public interest of the PRC, in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between the PRC and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. As there currently exists no treaty or other form of reciprocity between the PRC and the United States governing the recognition of judgments, including those predicated upon the liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, there is uncertainty whether and on what basis a PRC court would recognize and enforce judgments rendered by U.S. courts.

Our History
 
Our predecessor and current principal operating subsidiary, Tianwei Yingli, was established as a PRC limited liability company in August 1998. The initial holders of equity interests in Tianwei Yingli included Baoding Yingli Group Co., Ltd., or Yingli Group, and Baoding Gaoxin District Development Co., Ltd., a PRC company engaged in project investment and development in the national high-tech zone in the Baoding area which is wholly owned by the Management Committee of Baoding Gaoxin District, a local government agency. Mr. Liansheng Miao is the founder of Yingli Group and currently holds 100% equity interest in Yingli Group. Through a series of equity transfers among holders of Tianwei Yingli’s equity interests and additional equity contributions into Tianwei Yingli from 1998 to 2005, Tianwei Baobian and Yingli Group became the only two holders of equity interests in Tianwei Yingli as of December 9, 2005 and since then held 51% and 49% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, respectively, until the restructuring described below.
 
In 2002, Tianwei Yingli established Chengdu Yingli in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, together with unrelated parties, with Tianwei Yingli initially holding a 55% equity interest in Chengdu Yingli. Chengdu Yingli sells and installs PV systems. In May 2004, Tianwei Yingli acquired an additional 9% equity interest and increased its equity interest in Chengdu Yingli to 64%. In July 2007, we acquired

64

Table of Contents

the remaining 36% equity interest and increased our equity interest in Chengdu Yingli to 100%. In 2004, Tianwei Yingli acquired a 10% equity interest in Tibetan Yingli. Tibetan Yingli sells and installs PV systems. In September 2005, Tianwei Yingli acquired an additional 40% of the equity interest in Tibetan Yingli and increased its equity interest in Tibetan Yingli to 50%. In July 2007, we acquired a 30% equity interest in Dongfa Tianying for RMB 3 million. Dongfa Tianying manufactures and sells tempered glass and accessories. In August 2007, we established Yingli Green Energy (International) Holding Company Limited, or Yingli International, a British Virgin Islands company limited by shares as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Yingli International is primarily engaged in the sales and marketing of PV products and relevant accessories and investment in renewable energy projects. In October 2007, we established Yingli Energy (China) Company Ltd., or Yingli China, a PRC limited liability company, as our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary. Yingli China is primarily engaged in the research, manufacturing, sale and installation of renewable energy products. In November 2007, we established Yingli Green Energy Europe GmbH, or Yingli Europe, a German limited liability company, as our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary. Yingli Europe is primarily engaged in the sale and marketing of PV products and relevant accessories in Europe. In November 2007, we also established Yingli Energy (Beijing) Co., Ltd., or Yingli Beijing, a PRC limited liability company, with Yingli International holding 90% equity interest in Yingli Beijing. Yingli Beijing is primarily engaged in the sale and manufacture of PV modules and PV systems.
 
Restructuring
 
Yingli Green Energy was incorporated on August 7, 2006 in the Cayman Islands as part of a restructuring of the equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to facilitate investments by foreign financial investors in Tianwei Yingli and the listing of our shares on an overseas stock market to achieve such investors’ investment goal and exit and liquidity strategies. This restructuring involved the following transactions:
 
 	• 	On June 7, 2006, Yingli Power was established in the British Virgin Islands by its sole shareholder, Mr. Liansheng Miao;
 
 	• 	On August 7, 2006, in connection with the incorporation of Yingli Green Energy, Yingli Power subscribed for 50 million of our ordinary shares at par value of US$0.01 per share and became our sole shareholder. On September 25, 2006, Yingli Power subscribed for an additional 9.8 million of our ordinary shares for a consideration of US$100,000;
 
 	• 	On August 9, 2006, Yingli Group and Tianwei Baobian made additional equity contributions to Tianwei Yingli, as a result of which, (i) the registered capital of Tianwei Yingli was increased from RMB 75 million to RMB 100 million; (ii) Yingli Group increased its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli from 49% to 51%; and (iii) the equity interest of Tianwei Baobian in Tianwei Yingli was correspondingly decreased from 51% to 49%;
 
 	• 	On August 25, 2006, we entered into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company contract with Tianwei Baobian under which we granted to Tianwei Baobian a right to subscribe for newly issued ordinary shares of us in exchange for all but not part of Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Tianwei Baobian may exercise this subscription right only after certain conditions (as described below) are satisfied; and
 
 	• 	On September 5, 2006, Yingli Group transferred all of its 51% equity interest in Tianwe Yingli to us in a transaction between entities under common control for cash consideration of approximately RMB 134.6 million (US$17 million as translated at the applicable rate at the historical transaction date). As a result of such transfer, Tianwei Yingli became our subsidiary. For financial statements reporting purposes, Tianwei Yingli is deemed to be our predecessor.
 
Private Equity Investments and Other Financings Following the Restructuring
 
 	• 	On September 28, 2006, we issued to Inspiration Partners Limited 8,081,081 Series A preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$17.0 million. On the

65

Table of Contents

 		same date, we also issued to TB Management Ltd., an affiliate of Inspiration Partners Limited, a warrant to purchase 678,811 of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$2.10 per share, which has since been transferred to its affiliate, Fairdeal Development Ltd., and which was exercised on May 23, 2007. All outstanding Series A preferred shares held by Inspiration Partners Limited were automatically convertible into our ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial public offering at a conversion ratio of one-to-one, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions. The proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Series A preferred shares were used to finance the transfer to us of the 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli held by Yingli Group. Upon the completion of our initial public offering, all of our Series A preferred shares were converted into our ordinary shares on an one-for-one basis.
 
 	• 	On November 13, 2006, we issued interest-bearing mandatory redeemable bonds and mandatory convertible bonds to Yingli Power in the aggregate principal amount of US$85 million and at an issue price equal to 98.75% of such aggregate principal amount. The mandatory redeemable bonds in the principal amount of US$38 million were required to be redeemed at their principal amount upon the completion of our initial public offering. The mandatory convertible bonds in the principal amount of US$47 million were automatically convertible into our equity interest at an aggregate value equal to the value of a 3.73% effective equity interest in Tianwei Yingli at the time of the conversion upon the completion of our initial public offering. The net proceeds from these bonds were used (i) up to US$62 million, to increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli from 53.98% to 62.13% (which event occurred on December 18, 2006), (ii) up to US$17 million, to further increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, (iii) US$4.5 million to be held in a restricted account to be used to service the first three interest payments falling due under these bonds and (iv) the remaining proceeds for general corporate purpose and working capital. Upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007, we redeemed the mandatory redeemable bonds and issued 5,340,088 of our ordinary shares to Yingli Power upon conversion of the mandatory convertible bonds.
 
In connection with the issuance of these bonds, on November 13, 2006, our controlling shareholder, Yingli Power, issued to Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch, floating rate notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$85 million and at an issue price equal to 98.75% of such aggregate principal amount. The floating rate notes consisted of US$55 million mandatory redeemable notes and US$30 million mandatory exchangeable notes exchangeable into equity interests in us at an aggregate value substantially equal to the value of a 3.73% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli at the time of the exchange upon the completion of our initial public offering, the terms of which (other than the allocation of the principal amounts between the redeemable and convertible or exchangeable portions) were substantially similar to the terms of the mandatory redeemable bonds and the mandatory convertible bonds issued by us to Yingli Power. Yingli Power used the proceeds from the issuance of the floating rate notes to subscribe for the mandatory redeemable bonds and the mandatory convertible bonds issued by us. Yingli Power pledged to Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch all of its then existing equity interest in us and its other tangible and intangible asset as collateral for its obligations under these floating rate notes. Upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007, Yingli Power redeemed the mandatory redeemable notes and delivered 4,612,816 of our ordinary shares to Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch, and several underlying investors of these notes upon exchange of the mandatory exchangeable notes.
 
 	• 	On October 10, 2006, we amended the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian to make an equity contribution of US$17 million to Tianwei Yingli. The equity contribution was consummated on November 20, 2006, which increased our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 53.98% from 51%. This equity contribution was funded with advance payments in an aggregate amount of US$17 million from three of our Series B preferred shareholders described below.

 	• 	On November 13, 2006, we further amended the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian to make an additional equity contribution of US$62 million to Tianwei Yingli. The equity contribution was consummated on December 18, 2006 and was funded with proceeds from the issuance of the mandatory convertible bonds and the mandatory redeemable bonds. This equity contribution increased our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 62.13% from 53.98%.
 
 	• 	During the period from December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007, we issued to Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, or Baytree Investments, an affiliate of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, and 13 other investors, including J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., a total of 24,405,377 Series B preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of US$118 million, or at US$4.835 per share. Upon our initial public offering, all of our Series B preferred shares were converted into our ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
 
 	• 	On December 18, 2006, we further amended the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian for us to make an additional equity contribution of US$118 million to Tianwei Yingli. The equity contribution was consummated on June 20, 2007 and was funded with proceeds from the Series B and the other financings. This equity contribution increased our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 70.11% from 62.13%.
 
 	• 	On September 28, 2007, we further amended the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian to make an additional equity contribution of the U.S. dollar equivalent of RMB 1,750.84 million (US$233.7 million) to Tianwei Yingli, increasing Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital from RMB 1,624.38 million to RMB 3,375.22 million. Under PRC laws, the increase of Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital is subject to approval by the relevant PRC authority. We expect to obtain such approval by the end of 2007. Upon obtaining the requisite approval, we are required by the amendment to make the additional equity contribution to Tianwei Yingli within 60 days of the approval. We plan to fund the equity contribution primarily using part of the proceeds from our initial public offering. This equity contribution would increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 74.01% from 70.11%.
 
 	• 	In connection with a convertible loan to Tianwei Yingli from China Foreign Economic and Trade & Investment Co., Ltd., or FOTIC, a trust and investment company established in China, FOTIC acted as a nominee for certain third-party individuals. This convertible loan was made on May 17, 2006. Under a repayment and termination agreement dated December 29, 2006 among Tianwei Yingli, FOTIC, China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd., or China Sunshine, a British Virgin Islands investment holding company, and us, Tianwei Yingli repaid the convertible loan in the principal amount of RMB 85,635,000 (US$11,428,972) plus accrued interest of RMB 4,281,750 (US$571,449) on December 29, 2006. As a condition of repayment, under the repayment and termination agreement, we issued on December 29, 2006 to China Sunshine a warrant to purchase 2,068,252 of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$4.835 per share. On February 2, 2007, China Sunshine fully exercised this warrant at an exercise price per share of US$4.835 and purchased 2,068,252 of our ordinary shares.

Joint Venture Contract
 
Tianwei Baobian was established under the PRC law in September 1999 and its common shares have been listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since January 2001. The principal business of Tianwei Baobian is the manufacture of large electricity transformers. The controlling shareholder of Tianwei Baobian is Baoding Tianwei Group Co., Ltd., or Tianwei Group, a wholly state-owned limited liability company established in the PRC in January 1991. The controlling person of Tianwei Group is the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the Baoding Municipal Government in Hebei Province of the PRC, or Baoding SASAC. In September 2007, Baoding SASAC entered into an agreement to transfer its equity interest in Tianwei Group to China South, subject to government approvals. Tianwei Baobian became a shareholder of Tianwei Yingli in April 2002.
 
We entered into a joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian on August 25, 2006 and amended the joint venture contract on October 10, 2006, November 13, 2006, December 18, 2006 and September 28, 2007, respectively. The joint venture contract is governed by PRC law and sets forth the respective rights and obligations of us and Tianwei Baobian relating to Tianwei Yingli. Baoding SASAC entered into an agreement in September 2007 to transfer its equity interest in Tianwei Group to China South, subject to government approvals.
 
The major provisions of this joint venture contract include the following:
 
Tianwei Yingli’s Management Structure
 
Board of Directors
 
The board of directors of Tianwei Yingli, or the board, is its highest authority and has the power to decide all matters important to Tianwei Yingli.
 
The board consists of nine directors, six of whom are appointed by us and three of whom are appointed by Tianwei Baobian. Each director is appointed for a term of three years and may serve consecutive terms if re-appointed by the party which originally appointed such director. Each director may be removed by its appointing party, at any time, with or without cause and may be replaced by a nominee appointed by such party before the expiration of such director’s term of office.
 
The chairperson of the board is the legal representative of Tianwei Yingli. The chairperson has the right to vote as any other director and does not have a casting vote. Tianwei Baobian is entitled to appoint a director to serve as the chairperson of the board and we are entitled to appoint a director to serve as the vice chairperson of the board.

68

Table of Contents

A unanimous approval of all directors present in person or by proxy at the meeting of the board or, in the event of a written resolution, a unanimous approval of all directors, is required for resolutions involving the following matters:
 
 	• 	amendment to the articles of association of Tianwei Yingli;
 
 	• 	merger of Tianwei Yingli with another entity;
 
 	• 	division of Tianwei Yingli;
 
 	• 	termination or dissolution of Tianwei Yingli; and
 
 	• 	increase, reduction or transfer of the registered capital of Tianwei Yingli.
 
Resolutions of the board involving any other matters may be adopted by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of all directors present in person or by proxy at a meeting of the board.
 
The board is required to meet at least once each quarter. In addition to the regular meetings, the board may hold interim meetings. Each director has one vote at a meeting of the board. Board meetings are convened and presided over by the chairperson or, in his or her absence, by the vice chairperson or, in the absence of the vice chairperson, by a director elected by the majority of the directors. The board may adopt written resolutions in lieu of a board meeting, as long as the resolutions to be adopted are delivered to all directors and affirmatively signed and adopted by each director. The board members are required to act in accordance with board resolutions and may not do anything to jeopardize the interests of Tianwei Yingli.
 
A quorum for a meeting of the board is two thirds of the board members present, in person (including through telephone or video conference) or by proxy. If a meeting has been duly called and a quorum in person or by proxy is not present, no resolutions made at the meeting will be valid, and the director presiding over this meeting is required to postpone the meeting for no more than seven working days and send written notice of postponement to all directors. Any director who fails to attend the postponed meeting in person or by proxy will be deemed to be present at the meeting and be counted in the quorum, but such director will be deemed to have waived his or her voting rights.
 
Supervisors
 
Tianwei Yingli is required to have two supervisors. Tianwei Baobian and we each appoint one supervisor. Each supervisor is appointed for a term of three years and may serve consecutive terms if re-appointed by the party which originally appointed such supervisor. The supervisors may attend board meetings as non-voting members and make inquiries and suggestions as to matters submitted to board meetings for resolution. The major duties and powers of the supervisors are as follows:
 
 	• 	inspect financial affairs of Tianwei Yingli;
 
 	• 	monitor acts of directors and senior managers in the performance of their duties to Tianwei Yingli, and propose removal of directors or senior managers who have violated any laws, regulations, the articles of association of Tianwei Yingli or any board resolutions;
 
 	• 	demand directors and senior managers to correct any of their act that harms Tianwei Yingli’s interests; and
 
 	• 	propose interim meetings of the board.
 
Senior Management
 
Tianwei Yingli is required to have one chief executive officer and one chief financial officer. We nominate the chief executive officer for appointment by the board. The chief executive officer serves a term of three years and may serve consecutive terms if re-nominated by us and re-appointed by the board. The chief executive officer has overall responsibilities for the daily operation and management of Tianwei Yingli and reports directly to the board. The chief executive officer nominates the chief

financial officer for appointment by the board. The chief financial officer is responsible for financial matters of Tianwei Yingli and reports to the chief executive officer.
 
Subscription Right
 
Under the joint venture contract, we granted to Tianwei Baobian a right to subscribe for ordinary shares newly issued by us in exchange for all but not part of Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Tianwei Baobian may exercise the subscription right if, and only if, the following conditions are satisfied:
 
 	• 	we have completed our initial public offering;
 
 	• 	ADSs representing our ordinary shares are listed on a qualified securities exchange, which is defined under the joint venture contract to include, among others, the NYSE; and
 
 	• 	Tianwei Baobian obtains all necessary approvals from relevant PRC government authorities for acquiring our ordinary shares as a result of exercising the subscription right.
 
Subject to applicable laws in the PRC, the Cayman Islands, any jurisdiction in which our ADSs are listed and any jurisdiction in which a qualified securities exchange, including the NYSE, is located and further subject to the listing rules of such exchange, Tianwei Baobian may exercise the subscription right by sending a written notice to us within one month following the first date on which all conditions listed above are satisfied, accompanied by copies of related approvals and opinion of counsel.
 
Prior to exercising its subscription right, Tianwei Baobian is required to retain an asset valuation firm reasonably acceptable to us to obtain a valuation of Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest in Tianwei Yingli in accordance with internationally accepted valuation methods and relevant PRC laws and regulations. The valuation report will need to be acknowledged by both Tianwei Baobian and us. Under relevant PRC laws and regulations, the value of Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest in Tianwei Yingli agreed by Tianwei Baobian and us for the purpose of Tianwei Baobian’s exercise of the subscription right shall not be lower than 90% of the value of such equity interest as indicated in the valuation report.
 
The number of our new ordinary shares that we are obligated to issue to Tianwei Baobian upon its exercise of the subscription right will be calculated according to the following formula:
 
(EQUATION)
 
(1)		Tianwei Baobian and we have agreed that the effective equity interest percentage in Tianwei Yingli indirectly held by Tianwei Baobian by way of its ownership of the equity interest in us following its exercise of the subscription right must be equal to the equity interest percentage in Tianwei Yingli directly held by Tianwei Baobian immediately prior to the exercise of the subscription right.
 
If Tianwei Baobian is unable to exercise the subscription right within a 300-day period from the date of the completion of our initial public offering and listing of our ADSs on a qualified securities exchange, Tianwei Baobian may request us to make best efforts to purchase from Tianwei Baobian all but not part of its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Upon such request by Tianwei Baobian, we will

70

Table of Contents

undertake to use our best efforts to assist Tianwei Baobian in completing the transfer of such equity interest held by Tianwei Baobian. The manner and the price at which Tianwei Baobian sells its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli will be decided by mutual agreement between Tianwei Baobian and us based on the fair market value of its and our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, respectively, and in accordance with relevant PRC laws and regulations.
 
Tianwei Yingli’s Registered Capital
 
Tianwei Yingli currently has a registered capital of RMB 1,624.38 million, of which we contributed RMB 1,575.38 million, currently representing 70.11% of Tianwei Yingli’s equity interest, and Tianwei Baobian contributed RMB 49.0 million, currently representing the remaining 29.89% of Tianwei Yingli’s interest. Upon the completion of relevant PRC registration procedure for the additional equity contribution of RMB 1,750.84 million, Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital will increase to RMB 3,375.22 million. Upon the completion of the additional equity contribution, Tianwei Yingli’s equity interest held by us will become 74.01%, with Tianwei Baobian holding the remaining 25.99% of equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. The registered capital of a company refers to the total amount of the capital subscribed by the equity interest holders of such company, as registered with relevant authorities. A shareholder of a company is entitled to the rights to and interests in such company in proportion to the fully paid amount of the registered capital of such company for which such shareholder subscribes or as otherwise agreed among the shareholders of such company. Such rights and interests include the rights to nominate directors to the board and receive dividends in proportion to the fully paid amount of the registered capital subscribed by such equity interest holders or as otherwise agreed among such equity interest holders. Under the PRC law, the rights and interests of a shareholder to a limited liability company are generally referred to as “equity interest”.
 
Increase or Reduction of Tianwei Yingli’s Registered Capital
 
Approval by the Board and the Relevant PRC Authority
 
Any increase or reduction of Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital is subject to unanimous approval of all directors present in person or by proxy at a meeting of the board or, in the event of a written resolution, the unanimous approval of all directors, as well as approval of the relevant PRC authority.
 
Preemptive Right
 
If the board resolves to increase Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital, both Tianwei Baobian and we have the preemptive right to make additional contributions to the registered capital in proportion to its and our respective equity interests in Tianwei Yingli as of the date of the board’s resolution. If Tianwei Baobian and we choose to make such additional contributions, we are obligated to pay in full our respective additional contributions within 30 days after the relevant PRC authority approves the increase of Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital.
 
If a party notifies the board in writing of its decision not to make all or part of the additional contribution that it is entitled to make, or fails to pay in full its additional contribution within 30 days after the approval by the relevant PRC authority (such party being the non-contributing party), the other party has the right, but not the obligation, to make an additional contribution to the extent that the first party fails or elects not to contribute (such other party, if it so contributes, being the contributing party). In this event, the board will retain an independent asset valuation firm to obtain a valuation of Tianwei Yingli in accordance with internationally accepted valuation methods and relevant PRC laws and regulations. If the non-contributing party does not make any additional contribution to Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital while the contributing party does, the contributing party’s

shareholding percentage in Tianwei Yingli immediately after its contribution will be calculated as follows:
 
(EQUATION)
 
 
(1)		Fair market value means the expected value of Tianwei Yingli immediately following the contribution by the contributing party to Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital.
 
Our Additional Contribution to Tianwei Yingli’s Registered Capital with Proceeds from our Initial Public Offering, this Offering or Private Placements
 
Notwithstanding the above, if we intend to use proceeds from our initial public offering, this offering or any private placement transaction to make additional contributions to Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital, Tianwei Baobian must cause all directors appointed by Tianwei Baobian to vote in favor of an increase of Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital, and to take all actions necessary to obtain the approval of the relevant PRC authority. In such event, the board shall retain an independent asset valuation firm to obtain a valuation of Tianwei Yingli in accordance with internationally accepted valuation methods and relevant PRC laws and regulations. The percentage of our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli immediately after we make an additional contribution to Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital with proceeds of our initial public offering, this offering or any private placement transaction will be calculated as follows:
 
(EQUATION)
 
 
(1)		Fair market value means the expected value of Tianwei Yingli immediately following our contribution to Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital with proceeds from our initial public offering, this offering or from a private placement transaction, as the case may be. After our additional contribution as described above, Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest in Tianwei Yingli will be diluted in the same proportion as our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli immediately prior to such additional contribution.

The non-transferring party will be deemed to have consented to the proposed transfer if the transferring party has not received an acceptance notice within 30 days after the non-transferring party’s receipt of the offer notice. In such an event, the transferring party may transfer the offered interest to the proposed third-party transferee within 60 days after expiration of the 30-day period as provided above and on terms no more favorable than specified in the offer notice, and the non-transferring party is obligated to sign a statement indicating its consent and waiver of its right of first refusal.
 
Notwithstanding the right of first refusal as described above, after completion of our initial public offering and listing of our ADSs on the NYSE, all or any part of the interest in Tianwei Yingli held by Tianwei Baobian or us may be transferred to its or our respective affiliates, and the other party is obligated to consent to such transfer.
 
Approval by the Board and the Relevant PRC Authority

Yingli Green Energy was incorporated on August 7, 2006. For the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 4, 2006, Yingli Green Energy did not engage in any business or operations. On September 5, 2006, Yingli Group, an entity controlled by Mr. Liansheng Miao, our chairperson and chief executive officer, who also controls our controlling shareholder, Yingli Power, transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to Yingli Green Energy. For further details on this transaction, see “History and Restructuring”. As Yingli Group and we were entities under common control at the time of the transfer, the 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli were recorded by us at the historical cost to Yingli Group, which approximated the historical carrying values of the assets and liabilities of Tianwei Yingli. For financial statements reporting purposes, Tianwei Yingli is deemed to be our predecessor for periods prior to September 5, 2006.

Notes:
 
(1)		Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, is not a share-based company and had no outstanding shares for the periods presented, and therefore, we have not presented earnings per share for Tianwei Yingli.
 
(2)		As of December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, September 4, 2006, December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, amounts due from related parties that were classified as current assets were RMB 1.0 million, RMB 3.3 million, RMB 1.3 million, RMB 26.0 million, RMB 77.2 million, RMB 13.2 million (US$1.8 million) and RMB 311.2 million (US$41.5 million), respectively.
 
(3)		Includes loans guaranteed or entrusted by related parties, which amounted to RMB 10.0 million, RMB 51.0 million, RMB 80.0 million, RMB 234.0 million, RMB 784.0 million, RMB 233.0 million (US$31.1 million) and RMB 472.4 million (US$63.0 million), as of December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, September 4, 2006, December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively.
 
(4)		PV modules sold, for a given period, represents the total PV modules, as measured in megawatts, delivered to customers under the then effective supply contracts during such period.
 
(5)		We compute average selling price of PV modules per watt for a given period as the total sales of PV modules divided by the total watts of the PV modules sold during such period, and translated into U.S. dollars at the noon buying rate at the end of such period as certified by the United States Federal Reserve Board.
 
(6)		Commencing January 1, 2007, our primary operating subsidiary, Tianwei Yingli, began enjoying certain exemptions from income tax. These income tax exemptions had the effect of increasing our net income by RMB 69.3 million (US$9.2 million) and increasing our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders on a basic per share basis by RMB 0.79 (US$0.11) and on a diluted per share basis by RMB 0.76 (US$0.10) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007. Prior to this period, there was no tax exemption in place.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section entitled “Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Data”, and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes of us and our predecessor included elsewhere in this prospectus. The discussion in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus.
 
Yingli Green Energy was incorporated on August 7, 2006. On September 5, 2006, Yingli Group, an entity controlled by Mr. Liansheng Miao, our chairperson and chief executive officer, who also controls our controlling shareholder, Yingli Power, transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to Yingli Green Energy. For further details on this transaction, see “History and Restructuring”. As Yingli Group and we were entities under common control at the time of the transfer, the 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli were recorded by us at the historical cost to Yingli Group, which approximated the historical carrying value of the assets and liabilities of Tianwei Yingli. For financial statements reporting purposes, Tianwei Yingli is deemed to be our predecessor for periods prior to September 5, 2006.
 
In our discussion of the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2006, we refer to certain line items or captions in the financial statements as “combined” for comparative purposes. These unaudited combined amounts represent the addition of the amounts for certain financial statement line items or captions of Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, and the amounts for the corresponding financial statement line items or captions of Yingli Green Energy, for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30 or December 31, 2006, as applicable. For the period from August 7, 2006 through September 4, 2006, during which the financial statements of the predecessor and those of the Yingli Green Energy overlap, Yingli Green Energy did not engage in any business or operations. The unaudited combined financial data for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006 do not comply with U.S. GAAP. We are including these unaudited combined amounts to supplementally provide information which we believe will be helpful to gaining a better understanding of our results of operations and improve the comparative period-to-period analysis. These unaudited combined amounts do not purport to represent what our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would have been in such periods if Yingli Group had transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to us on January 1, 2006.

Through Tianwei Yingli, our principal operating subsidiary based in China, we design, manufacture and sell PV modules, and design, assemble, sell and install PV systems. We sell PV modules to PV system integrators and distributors located in various markets around the world, including Germany, Spain, Italy, China and the United States. Currently, we also sell PV systems primarily to customers in China.
 
We currently conduct all of our operations through Tianwei Yingli. Tianwei Yingli was formed as a limited liability company established in China in August 1998 with Yingli Group as one of its initial shareholders. As part of a restructuring, Mr. Liansheng Miao, the controlling shareholder of Yingli Group, established Yingli Power in the British Virgin Islands and established us in the Cayman Islands as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yingli Power, and on September 5, 2006, Yingli Group transferred all of its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to us for approximately RMB 134.6 million (US$17 million, as translated at the applicable rate at the historical transaction date) in cash. Subsequently, we completed private placements of Series A preferred shares, Series B preferred shares, warrants,

mandatory convertible bonds and mandatory redeemable bonds as well as our initial public offering in June 2007, and as a result, Mr. Liansheng Miao’s effective ownership percentage in us decreased from 100% to 45.76% immediately prior to this offering. Following such private placements and, the equity contribution of the net proceeds from such private placements and the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering to Tianwei Yingli, our current ownership percentage in Tianwei Yingli’s equity interests is 70.11%. Pursuant to the latest amendment to our joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian and upon obtaining requisite approval by relevant PRC authority, we expect to make an additional equity contribution into Tianwei Yingli primarily from the proceeds of our initial public offering, which would increase our equity interest to 74.01%. See “History and Restructuring — Private Equity Investments and Other Financings Following the Restructuring”.
 
Our production capacity and operations have grown significantly since we completed construction of our first manufacturing facilities for PV modules in 2002. We use most of the polysilicon ingots and wafers and PV cells we produce for the production of PV modules, which we sell to third party customers. We sold 4.7 megawatts, 11.9 megawatts, 51.3 megawatts and 91.6 megawatts of PV modules in 2004, 2005, 2006 and in the first nine months of 2007, respectively.
 
The most significant factors that affect our financial performance and results of operations are:
 
 	• 	industry demand;
 
 	• 	government subsidies and economic incentives;
 
 	• 	capacity;
 
 	• 	availability and price of polysilicon;
 
 	• 	vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities;
 
 	• 	competition and product pricing; and
 
 	• 	manufacturing technologies.
 
Industry Demand
 
Our business and revenue growth depend on the market demand for PV products. Although solar power technology has been used for several decades, the PV market grew significantly only in the past several years. According to Solarbuzz, the global PV market, as measured by annual PV system installation, increased from 345 megawatts in 2001 to 1,744 megawatts in 2006. Solarbuzz’s “Balanced Energy” forecast scenario forecasted global PV industry revenues and PV system installations to be US$18.6 billion and 4,177 megawatts in 2011, respectively. Demand tends to be lower in the first quarter than in the subsequent three quarters in a given year, primarily because of adverse weather conditions in our key markets, such as Germany, which complicate the installation of solar power systems. See “Business — Industry” for a more detailed discussion on the factors driving the growth of the PV industry and the challenges that it faces.
 
Government Subsidies and Economic Incentives
 
We believe that the near-term growth of the market for PV products depends largely on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. Today, the cost of solar power substantially exceeds the cost of electrical power generated from conventional fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. As a result, governments in many countries, including Germany, Spain, Italy, the United States, Japan and China, have provided subsidies and economic incentives for the use of renewable energy such as solar power to reduce dependency on conventional fossil fuels as a source of energy. These subsidies and economic incentives have been in the form of capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products, including PV products. The demand for our PV modules and PV systems in our current, targeted or potential markets is affected significantly by these

government subsidies and economic incentives. See “Business — Industry” for a more detailed discussion on the various forms of government subsidies and economic incentives.
 
Capacity
 
In order to take advantage of the rapidly increasing market demand for PV products, we have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our manufacturing capacity significantly. We started producing PV modules in 2002 with initial production capacity of three megawatts, polysilicon ingots and wafers in October 2003 with initial production capacity of six megawatts and PV cells in March 2004 with initial annual manufacturing capacity of three megawatts. In accordance with our business model of a vertically integrated PV product manufacturer, we have expanded our manufacturing capacity for each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to 200 megawatts as of the date of this prospectus.
 
The size of production capacity has a significant bearing on the profitability and competitive position of PV product manufacturers. Increased production capacity generates greater revenues through the production and sales of more PV products and also contributes to reduced manufacturing costs through economies of scale. Achieving economies of scale from expanded production capacity is critical to our maintaining competitive position in the PV industry as manufacturers with greater economies of scale can obtain a greater market share of the PV products by offering their products at a more competitive price by virtue of their greater ability to obtain volume discounts from their raw material suppliers and have other bargaining leverage.
 
We currently plan to expand our annual manufacturing capacity for each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to 400 megawatts by the end of 2008 through an expansion project to be conducted by Tianwei Yingli and to 600 megawatts by the end of 2009 through a new construction project to be conducted by Yingli China in Baoding, China. We expect that achieving the same level of manufacturing capacity for each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules will improve our profit margins, as we will no longer need to engage third-party PV cell manufacturers to process a portion of our excess wafers into PV cells for us.
 
Availability and Price of Polysilicon
 
High purity polysilicon and polysilicon scraps are the most important raw materials used in our manufacturing process. In 2003, we produced PV modules using PV cells purchased from third parties, and therefore in 2003, PV cells, not polysilicon, represented our principal cost of revenues.
 
Over the past few years, polysilicon suppliers have been raising their prices and adding manufacturing capacity in response to growing demand from the PV and semiconductor industries. Our average purchase price of polysilicon per kilogram, calculated based on the total contract price for the quantity of polysilicon purchased under these contracts during the relevant period of time, has increased by 106.5% in 2005 compared to 2004, by 185.5% in 2006 compared to 2005, by 45.2% in the first nine months of 2007 compared to the full year 2006 and by 80.9% in the first nine months of 2007 compared to the first nine months of 2006. The increasing price of polysilicon has driven up our manufacturing costs in the past three years and may further drive up our manufacturing costs notwithstanding our continuing efforts to use polysilicon more efficiently.
 
We believe the average price of polysilicon will remain high in the near term due to the continued strong demand for polysilicon resulting from the rapid growth of the PV industry, the significant lead time required for building additional capacity for polysilicon production and significant competing demand for polysilicon from the semiconductor industry. The average price of polysilicon over the medium-to-long term will, however, depend on a number of factors, including the scope and progress of current and future manufacturing capacity expansion plans of the polysilicon suppliers, the level of demand for polysilicon from the PV and the semiconductor industries and any changes in government regulations and subsidies in respect of PV and other alternative energy industry that may significantly affect the demand outlook for polysilicon. We believe that none of these factors can be

predicted with reasonable certainty as of the date of this prospectus, and the average price of polysilicon may increase or decrease significantly over the medium- to long-term as a result of any combination of such factors. Building polysilicon manufacturing lines generally requires significant upfront capital commitment and it typically takes an average of 18 to 24 months to construct a manufacturing line and put it into production. As a result, polysilicon suppliers are generally willing to expand their production capacity only if they are certain of sufficient potential customer demand to justify such capital commitment. Therefore, polysilicon suppliers typically require customers to make a certain percentage of an initial advance payment followed by additional advance payments of the remaining balance in advance of shipment. As a result, the purchase of polysilicon has required, and will continue to require, us to make significant working capital commitments beyond the capital generated from our cash flows from operations. We are required to maintain adequate cash position to continue to support our purchases of raw materials.
 
Our process technology enables us to increase our utilization of polysilicon scraps in the production of ingots and wafers. In addition, we also plan to utilize polysilicon scraps and lower-grade polysilicon to produce monocrystalline silicon suitable for combining into our production of ingots and wafers to reduce manufacturing costs. The price of polysilicon scraps has historically been significantly lower than the price of high purity polysilicon. However, due to the PV industry’s growing demand for polysilicon scraps, prices of polysilicon scraps have also been increasing.
 
The increase in demand for polysilicon which outpaced the increase in polysilicon manufacturing capacity has caused polysilicon supply shortages in the PV industry since 2004, and we have from time to time experienced late or failed deliveries and supply shortages. To date, such late or failed deliveries and supply shortages have had no material effect on our output level. As the PV industry continues to grow, the availability of high purity polysilicon and polysilicon scraps will, to a large extent, determine the output of PV product manufacturers. Failure to obtain sufficient quantities of high purity polysilicon and polysilicon scraps could limit our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity as currently planned and consequently decrease our revenues. We expect that the supply of high purity polysilicon and polysilicon scraps will continue to be tight in the near future.
 
In order to secure adequate and timely supply of high purity polysilicon and polysilicon scraps, we have entered into various purchase agreements and memorandums of understanding with local and foreign suppliers, including the world’s major polysilicon suppliers. As of the date of this prospectus, we have secured all of our estimated polysilicon needs for 2007 and more than 60% of our estimated polysilicon needs for 2008 based on our current capacity expansion plan. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure sufficient quantities of polysilicon and polysilicon scraps to support the expansion of our manufacturing capacity as currently planned. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry — We are currently experiencing and may continue to experience an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon. Our failure to obtain sufficient quantities of polysilicon in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, prevent us from operating at full capacity or limit our ability to expand as planned, which will reduce, and limit the growth of, our manufacturing output and revenue”.
 
Historically, the effect of the increase in the cost of polysilicon has been partially offset by our greater scalability of operations, increasingly efficient use of polysilicon and improvements in our process technologies and increased price of PV modules. Our cost of revenues for the sale of PV modules as a percentage of net revenues from the sale of PV modules decreased from 79.5% in 2004 to 69.8% in 2005, and increased to 71.9% in 2006 and to 76.8% in the first nine months of 2007.
 
Vertically Integrated Manufacturing Capabilities
 
We believe our vertically integrated business model offers us several advantages, particularly in areas of cost reduction and quality control, over our competitors that depend on third parties to source core product components. First, the vertical integration enables us to capture margins at every stage

83

Table of Contents

of the PV product value chain in which we are engaged. Second, by streamlining our manufacturing processes, we can reduce production costs and costs associated with toll manufacturing, packaging and transportation as well as breakage loss that occur during shipment between various production locations associated with toll manufacturing arrangements. Toll manufacturing is a type of contract manufacturing frequently used in the PV industry, under which part of the manufacturing process is outsourced to qualified third parties, or toll manufacturers. The raw materials used by toll manufacturers are usually supplied by the outsourcing company in order to control sourcing quality. In our case, toll manufacturing arrangements have been limited to sending a portion of our wafers to third-party PV cell manufacturers and receiving PV cells from them in return. We pay the toll manufacturers a processing fee for such toll manufacturing services. Third, we control operations at substantially all stages of the PV value chain, including research and development, which enables us to more closely monitor the quality of our PV products from start to finish, and design and streamline our manufacturing processes in a way that enables us to leverage our technologies more efficiently and reduce costs at each stage of the manufacturing process. We believe that the synergy effect from our vertically integrated business model has enabled us to reduce the quantity of polysilicon we use to make PV modules, improve the conversion efficiency of our PV cells and reduce the lead time needed to fulfill our customer orders.
 
Competition and Product Pricing
 
PV modules, which are currently our principal products, are priced primarily on the basis of the number of watts of electricity they generate and the market price per watt for PV modules. We price our PV modules based on the prevailing market prices at the time we enter into sales contracts with our customers or as our customers place their purchase orders with us, taking into account various factors including, among others, the size of the contract or the purchase order, the strength and history of our relationship with a particular customer and our polysilicon costs. We believe that the quality of our PV products and our low-cost manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to price our products competitively and will further provide us with flexibility in adjusting the price of our products without significantly affecting our profit margins.
 
Since 2003 and until recently, the average selling price for PV modules has been rising across the industry, due to the high demand for PV modules as well as rising polysilicon costs during the same period. Correspondingly, the average selling price per watt of our PV modules increased from US$2.83 in 2004 to US$3.49 in 2005 to US$3.82 in 2006 (each computed as the total sales of PV modules divided by the total watts of the PV modules sold during a given period, and translated into U.S. dollars at the noon buying rate at the end of such period as certified by the United States Federal Reserve Board). However, we expect that the prices of PV products, including PV modules, will decline over time due to increased supply of PV products, reduced manufacturing costs from economies of scale, advancement of manufacturing technologies and cyclical downturns in the price of polysilicon. In fact, there are signs of modest decline in PV module price, and in the first nine months of 2007, the average selling price per watt of our PV modules declined slightly to US$3.77. Fluctuations in prevailing market prices may have a material effect on the prices of our PV modules and our profitability, particularly if the price of PV modules declines or if the price of PV modules rises at a slower pace than the cost of polysilicon increases.
 
We sell our PV modules primarily through sales contracts with a term of less than one year and are obligated to deliver PV modules according to pre-agreed prices and delivery schedules. We typically require our customers to pay a certain percentage of the purchase price as advance payment within a short period after signing the sales contracts. Some of our customers make advance payment of another portion of the purchase price within a short period before we ship the goods. The percentage of advance payments varies depending on the credit status of our customers, our relationship with the customers, market demand and the terms of a particular contract.

Manufacturing Technologies
 
The advancement of manufacturing technologies is important in increasing the conversion efficiency of PV cells and reducing the production costs of PV products. Because PV modules are priced based on the number of watts of electricity they generate, higher conversion efficiency generally leads to higher revenues from the sale of PV modules.
 
We are continuously developing advanced manufacturing technologies to increase the conversion efficiency of our PV cells. We employ a number of techniques to reduce our production costs while striving to reach a PV cell conversion efficiency ratio that is on par with or above an acceptable range. First, we use multicrystalline polysilicon, which is less expensive than monocrystalline polysilicon for our feedstock. While multicrystalline polysilicon tends to yield lower conversion efficiency than monocrystalline polysilicon, we believe cost savings from the use of multicrystalline polysilicon outweigh the reduced level of conversion efficiency. Second, we use polysilicon feedstock that mixes high purity polysilicon with polysilicon scraps, which is substantially less expensive than high purity polysilicon, at a ratio which we believe yields an optimal balance of cost and quality. Third, our research and development team continues to focus on finding ways to improve our manufacturing technology and reduce manufacturing costs without compromising the quality of our products.
 
Net Revenues
 
We currently derive net revenues from three sources:
 
 	• 	Sales of PV modules, which are currently our principal source of revenues and are primarily driven by market demand as well as our production capacity;
 
 	• 	Sales of PV systems, which consist of sales of PV systems and related installation services;
 
 	• 	Other revenues, which consist primarily of occasional sales of substandard PV cells, wafers and raw materials and to a lesser extent, sales from processing PV cells into PV modules for third-party vendors.

We have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. In 2004, 2005, 2006 and the first nine months of 2007, sales to customers that individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenues accounted for 35.1%, 38.7%, 38.9% and 50.7% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. Our largest customers have changed from year to year due to the rapid growth of the sales of our PV modules, our diversification into new geographic markets and our ability to find new customers willing to place large orders with us. Customers whose purchases accounted for 10.0% or more of our consolidated net revenue were Conergy, Sunline AG and Inceisa, one of our shareholders, in 2006 and Acciona Energia S.A., Control y Montages Industriales CYMI S.A., and Inceisa in the first nine months of 2007.

All of our net revenues from sales of PV systems are currently derived from China. In 2003, we were awarded a large-scale, government-sponsored stand-alone PV system project in the Western China. This project, known as the “Electrification Project for Townships in The Western China”, was a government-sponsored project for installation of stand-alone PV systems, for which we installed nine solar power stations in Sichuan Province with total power output of approximately 0.9 megawatts from 2003 to 2004 and a 0.23 megawatt street lamp project with the Beijing local government in 2006.

Cost of Revenues
 
Our cost of PV module sales consists primarily of:
 
 	• 	Polysilicon.  The cost of high-purity polysilicon and polysilicon scraps is the largest component of our total cost of revenues. We purchase polysilicon from various suppliers, including silicon manufacturers and distributors.
 
 	• 	Other Raw Materials.  Other raw materials include crucibles, silicon carbides, cutting fluid, steel cutting wires, alkaline detergents, metallic pastes, laminate materials, silica gel, tempered glass, aluminum frames, solder, junction boxes, cables, connectors and other chemical agents and electronic components.
 
 	• 	Toll Manufacturing.  We process silicon raw materials into ingots and produce wafers, PV cells and PV modules in-house. As our PV cell production capacity used to be less than the production capacities for our wafers and PV modules, we used to send a portion of excess wafers to third-party PV cell manufacturers and receive PV cells from them under toll manufacturing arrangements which are then used to produce our PV modules. As our PV cell production has reached the same level as our wafer and PV module production through the ramp-up of our production capacity, we have terminated these toll manufacturing arrangements. The cost of producing PV cells through a toll manufacturing arrangement is typically higher than the cost of producing them in-house.
 
 	• 	Direct Labor.  Direct labor costs include salaries and benefits for personnel directly involved in the manufacturing activities.
 
 	• 	Overhead.  Overhead costs include utilities, maintenance of production equipment, land use rights and other ancillary expenses associated with the manufacturing activities.

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment.  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is 30 years for buildings, eight to ten years for machinery and motor vehicles and four to five years for electronic equipment and furniture and fixtures, taking into account their estimated residual value. Due to our capacity expansion, depreciation in absolute terms has increased significantly. We expect this trend to continue as we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity and build new facilities to attain annual manufacturing capacity for each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules of 400 megawatts by the end of 2008 and 600 megawatts by the end of 2009.
 
 	• 	Warranty Cost.  Our PV modules are typically sold with a two-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a ten-year and 25-year limited warranty against declines of more than 10.0% and 20.0%, respectively, from the initial power generation capacity at the time the product is sold. We maintain warranty reserves to cover potential liabilities that could arise under these warranties. Such warranties require us to fix or replace the defected products. We currently accrue the equivalent of 1% of net revenues as warranty reserves. We have not experienced any warranty claims since we started selling PV modules in January 2003. In 2004, 2005, 2006 and the first nine months of 2007, we recorded warranty expense of RMB 1.2 million, RMB 3.5 million, RMB 15.7 million (US$2.1 million) and RMB 25.8 million (US$3.4 million), respectively.
 
The cost of PV systems includes the costs of PV modules, batteries, inverters, other electronic components and related materials and labor.
 
Our cost of revenues is affected primarily by our ability to control raw material costs, achieve economies of scale in our operations and manage our vertically integrated product chain efficiently, which includes our prudent use of toll manufacturing arrangements to fill potential shortfalls in production capacity along the product chain until the disparity between our wafer production capacity and the PV cell production capacity is resolved. Furthermore, we balance automation and manual operation in our manufacturing process, and have been able to increase operating efficiencies and expand our manufacturing capacity cost effectively.
 
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
 
Our gross profit is affected by a number of factors, including the average selling prices for our PV products, the cost of polysilicon, product mix, economies of scale and benefits from vertical integration and our ability to cost-efficiently manage our raw material supply. Our gross profit increased from RMB 25.2 million in 2004 to RMB 108.2 million in 2005, to RMB 452.3 million (US$60.4 million) in 2006. Our gross profit increased to RMB 597.3 million (US$79.7 million) in the first nine months of 2007 from RMB 327.4 million in the first nine months of 2006 on a combined basis. Our gross profit margin changed from 20.9% in 2004 to 29.9% in 2005, to 27.6% in 2006. Our gross profit margin decreased from 29.9% in the first nine months of 2006 to 22.9% in the first nine months of 2007. The increase in gross margin from 2004 and 2005 was primarily due to improved economies of scale, higher operating efficiency and the advancement of process technologies, the effect of which was partially offset by the increase in the cost of polysilicon. The decrease in gross margin from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to a sharp increase in the cost of polysilicon, which outpaced cost reduction from the improved economies of scale and advancements in our process technologies. The decrease in gross margin from the first nine months of 2006 on a combined basis to the first nine months of 2007 was primarily due to the increase in the cost of polysilicon.
 
We may continue to face margin compression pressure in the sales of PV modules due to the increase in the market price of polysilicon and intense competition in the PV module market. We have been able to alleviate some of the margin pressure by manufacturing polysilicon ingots using a higher proportion of cheaper low-purity silicon materials. Furthermore, we believe that as our PV business expands and attains parity in production capacity for different phases of our product value chain,

88

Table of Contents

economies of scale and benefits from vertical integration, among other factors, will have a positive effect on our gross profit margins over time.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Our operating expenses consist of:
 
 	• 	Selling Expenses, which consist primarily of advertising costs, packaging and shipping costs, salaries and employee benefits of sales personnel, sales-related travel and entertainment expenses, amortization of intangible assets (including backlog and customer relationships) and other selling expenses including sales commissions paid to our sales agents. We expect that our selling expenses will increase in the near term as we increase sales efforts, hire additional sales personnel, target new markets and initiate additional marketing programs to build up our brand. However, we expect that the growth in net revenues will outpace the growth in selling expenses and increase the gross margin over time.
 
 	• 	General and Administrative Expenses, which consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our administrative and finance personnel, bad debt expense, other travel and entertainment expenses, bank charges, amortization of technical know-how, depreciation of equipment used for administrative purposes and share-based compensation expenses. We expect the general and administrative expenses will increase in the near term as a percentage of net revenue as we hire additional personnel and incur professional expenses to support our operations as a listed company in the United States. However, we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of net revenues over time as we achieve greater economies of scale.
 
 	• 	Research and Development Expenses, which consist primarily of costs of raw materials used in research and development activities, salaries and employee benefits for research and development personnel, and prototype and equipment costs relating to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products and manufacturing process. We are a party to several research grant contracts with the PRC government under which we receive funds for specified costs incurred in certain research projects. We record such amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses when the related research and development costs are incurred. We expect our research and development expenses (not adjusted for offsets by government grants) to increase as we place a greater strategic focus on PV system sales in overseas markets and as we continue to hire additional research and development personnel and focus on continuous innovation of process technologies for our PV products, including improving the technical know-how to produce ingots and wafers with a higher proportion of polysilicon scraps without compromising the conversion efficiency of our PV cells and modules. We conduct our research and development, design and manufacturing operations in China, where the costs of skilled labor, engineering and technical resources, as well as land, facilities and utilities, tend to be lower than those in more developed countries.
 
Taxation
 
Under current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to income or capital gains tax. Additionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands.
 
Tianwei Yingli, which is registered and operates in a “national high-tech zone” in Baoding, China, qualifies as a “high and new technology enterprise” under the FIE Income Tax Law and as a result has been entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15.0% through 2007. In accordance with the FIE Income Tax Law and the related implementing rules, as a foreign invested enterprise primarily engaged in manufacturing, Tianwei Yingli is entitled to a two-year exemption from the 15.0% enterprise income tax for its first two profitable years following its conversion into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company, which are currently expected to be 2007 and 2008 for purposes of relevant PRC tax regulations. Tianwei Yingli will thereafter be entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax

Table of Contents

rate of 7.5% for the succeeding three years, or until 2011. Yingli Green Energy would also be exempted from the withholding tax on dividends it receives from Tianwei Yingli.
 
On March 16, 2007, the EIT Law was enacted, and will become effective on January 1, 2008 when the FIE Income Tax Law and the Enterprise Income Tax Provisional Regulations of the PRC are scheduled to expire. Under the EIT Law, Yingli Green Energy may be considered a “resident enterprise” and therefore be subject to the EIT at the rate of 25% on its global income. However, under the EIT Law, Tianwei Yingli will continue to be entitled to the two-year exemption and three-year half reduction preferential treatment with respect to enterprise income tax for the period from 2007 to 2011 or, if it fails to record profits in 2007, it will continue to be entitled to such exemption and preferential treatment for the period from 2008 to 2012. Under the EIT Law, Tianwei Yingli will be exempted from the enterprise income tax for its first two profitable years following its conversion into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company, which are currently expected to be 2007 and 2008. Assuming that Tianwei Yingli qualifies as a “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State” and that Tianwei Yingli records profit in 2007, it will be entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 7.5% from 2009 until 2011 and the preferential income tax rate of 15% will be applicable to Tianwei Yingli starting from 2012. If Tianwei Yingli fails to qualify as a “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State” under the EIT Law, it will still be entitled to 50% relief from the enterprise income tax from 2009 until 2011, while the standard tax rate of 25% will be applicable starting from 2012. As a result of the new tax law and regulations, Tianwei Yingli’s effective tax rate may increase in the future.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on the judgment of our management.
 
Significant Factors, Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining the Fair Value of Series A and B Preferred Shares and Warrants
 
For the period from our inception on August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006 and prior to our initial public offering on June 13, 2007, we issued preferred shares and warrants as described below.
 
On September 28, 2006, we issued 8,081,081 Series A preferred shares at US$2.10 with a detachable warrant to purchase 678,811 ordinary shares at US$2.10, or Series A warrant. From December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007, we issued 20,268,872 Series B preferred shares at US$4.835 per share with detachable warrants to purchase 2,112,057 ordinary shares at US$0.01, or Series B warrants, to certain Series B preferred shareholders. On December 29, 2006, in conjunction with the repayment of a convertible loan issued by Tianwei Yingli to China Foreign Economics and Trade & Investment Co., Ltd., we issued a warrant, or the Sunshine warrant, to purchase 2,068,252 of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$4.835 per share to China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd. On March 27, 2007, in conjunction with the termination of the escrow arrangement to remove the restrictions placed on US$19.6 million of the total cash proceeds received from the issuance and sale of the Series B preferred shares, we issued additional Series B warrants to purchase 688,090 of our ordinary shares at US$0.01 to certain Series B preferred shareholders.

Table of Contents

The net proceeds received from the issuance of Series A preferred shares with a detachable warrant were allocated to the Series A preferred shares and Series A warrant based on their relative fair value of US$2.08 per share and US$0.31 per share, respectively. The net proceeds received from the issuance of Series B preferred shares with detachable warrants were allocated to the Series B preferred shares and Series B warrants based on their relative fair values of US$4.79 per share and US$0.42 per share, respectively. For purposes of allocating the net proceeds received from the Series A and Series B preferred shares that were issued with detachable warrants, the methods and assumptions used in determining the fair values of the preferred shares and warrants on a stand-alone basis are described below.
 
In determining the fair value of the preferred shares, we considered the guidance prescribed by the AICPA Audit and Accounting Practice Aid “Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation”, or Practice Aid. Specifically, paragraph 16 of the Practice Aid sets forth the preferred types of valuation that should be used. We followed the “level A” recommendation, the most preferred valuation method recommended by the Practice Aid. The stand-alone fair value of Series A preferred shares that were issued with a detachable warrant was determined based on a retrospective valuation as of the respective measurement date, performed by American Appraisal. The stand-alone fair value of the Series B preferred shares that were issued with detachable warrants was determined based on a contemporaneous valuation as of the respective measurement date, performed by American Appraisal. The following describes the methodology and major assumptions used by American Appraisal as set forth in its valuation reports, both dated March 30, 2007, for the valuation of the Series A warrant and the Series B warrants as of September 28, 2006 and December 20, 2006, respectively.
 
Since our capital structure comprised of preferred shares and ordinary shares at each measurement date, American Appraisal allocated our enterprise value between each class of equity using an option pricing method. The option pricing method treats ordinary shares and preferred shares as call options on the enterprise value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the preferred shares.
 
In determining our enterprise value at each measurement date, American Appraisal used a weighted average equity value derived by using a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flow method) and the market approach (guideline company method) and applied a 40% weight to the market approach and a 60% weight to the income approach to arrive at the fair value. There was no significant difference between the enterprise value of our valuation derived using the income approach and the enterprise value derived using the market approach.
 
For the market approach, American Appraisal considered the market profile and performance of eleven guideline companies with businesses similar to those of us. American Appraisal used information from the eleven listed guideline companies to derive market multiples. The eleven guideline companies identified were: Energy Conversion Devices, Inc, E-Ton Solar Tech Co Ltd, Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd, Solar Fabrik AG, Sunways AG, Solarworld AG, Solon AG, Q-Cells AG, Motech Industries Inc, SunPower Corporation, Ersol Solar Energy AG. American Appraisal then calculated the following three multiples for the guideline companies: enterprise value to sales multiple, enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, multiple and enterprise value to earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, multiple. Due to the different growth rates, profit margins and risk levels of us and the guideline companies, price multiple adjustments were made. American Appraisal used the 2007 adjusted median price multiples of the guideline companies in the valuation of our enterprise value. Estimated sales, EBITDA and EBIT of the guideline companies for 2007 were extracted from Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S) Earning Estimates, Bloomberg.
 
For the income approach, American Appraisal utilized a discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis based on our projected cash flows from 2006 through 2010. American Appraisal used a weighted

average cost of capital, or WACC, of 20% as of September 28, 2006 and 18% as of December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007, based on the WACC of the guideline companies.
 
American Appraisal also applied a discount for lack of marketability of 17% as of September 28, 2006 and 11% as of December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007 to reflect the fact that there is no ready market for shares in a closely held company like us. Because ownership interests in closely held companies are typically not readily marketable compared to similar public companies, we believe, a share in a privately held company is usually worth less than an otherwise comparable share in a publicly held company and therefore applied a discount for the lack of marketability of the privately held shares. When determining the discount for lack of marketability, the Black-Scholes option model was used. Under option pricing method, the cost of the put option, which can hedge the price change before the privately held shares can be sold, was considered as a basis to determine the discount for lack of marketability. The option pricing method was used because this method takes into account certain company-specific factors, including the size of our business and volatility of the share price of comparable companies engaged in the same industry. Volatility of 58% as of September 28, 2006 and 47% as of December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007 by using the mean of volatility of the guideline companies used in the market approach.
 
Based on the valuations performed by American Appraisal, the estimated fair value per share of Series A preferred shares issued on September 28, 2006 was US$2.40 and the estimated fair value per share of Series B preferred shares issued from December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007 was US$5.38, as set forth in its valuation reports, both dated March 30, 2007, for the valuation of the Series A warrant and the Series B warrants as of September 28, 2006 and December 20, 2006, respectively.
 
With respect to the valuation of Series B preferred shares issued from December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007, the estimated stand alone fair value of US$5.38 using the valuation techniques discussed above reasonably approximated the US$4.835 per share paid by third party investors for Series B preferred shares that were issued without any detachable warrants. Management believes that the difference between the fair value determined by American Appraisal and the US$4.835 was within a tolerable range of reasonableness. In addition, had we utilized the US$4.835 for purposes of determining the relative fair value of the Series B preferred shares issued with warrants, the impact to our results of operations and income available to ordinary shareholders would have been immaterial. Given the subjective nature of various assumptions and estimates that are required to determine the fair value of preferred shares of a privately held company, we believe that the assumptions and methodology utilized were appropriate and reasonable.
 
The relative fair values assigned to the Series A warrant and Series B warrants issued from December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007 and the stand-alone value of the Sunshine warrant and the additional Series B warrants issued on March 27, 2007 was approximately US$211,341 (RMB 1,671,432), US$850,482 (RMB 6,650,603), US$496,000 (RMB 3,908,381), and US$756,213 (RMB 5,848,702), respectively. We determined that the stand-alone per share fair value of the Series A warrant and Series B warrants was US$0.36 and US$0.48 (after a 90% discount), respectively. The fair values of these warrants utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The significant estimates and assumptions used by American Appraisal as set forth in its valuation reports for these warrants, dated March 30, 2007, to estimate the fair value of these warrants under the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The fair value of our ordinary shares of US$11.00 per share used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of estimating the fair value of the additional Series B warrants issued on March 27, 2007, which was also the initial public offering price per ordinary share, was based on our then best estimate of the expected mid-point of the initial public offering price range of our ordinary shares at that time.
 
We injected to Tianwei Yingli a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series B preferred shares in the form of a shareholder loan from us to Tianwei Yingli. The Series B warrants and the additional Series B warrants issued on March 27, 2007, are subject to cancellation and return features upon the conversion of such shareholder loan into an equity interest in Tianwei Yingli following relevant PRC regulatory approvals and completion of related procedural formalities. Based on our successful experience in two prior rounds of private placements, namely in connection with the Series A preferred shares and the mandatory convertible and redeemable bonds, in obtaining similar regulatory approvals for capital increases in Tianwei Yingli, we believe that the probability of obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals for the capital increase related to the Series B preferred shares, which would result in automatic cancellation of the Series B warrants, is 90%. Accordingly, the fair value of the Series B warrants, including the additional Series B warrants issued on March 27, 2007, determined utilizing Black-Scholes option pricing model was discounted by 90% to take into account our estimate of the probability of the warrants not being exercised and therefore cancelled. In addition, the Company believes the 90% discount reflects our assumptions based on the best information available in the circumstances, of what the Series B preferred shareholders considered in accepting the terms of the warrants. Under an agreement dated May 21, 2007, among us, Yingli Power, Mr. Liansheng Miao and Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, the lead Series B preferred shareholder, the Series B warrants and the additional Series B warrants issued on March 27, 2007 were rendered not exercisable in light of the substantial progress in the relevant PRC regulatory approval process related to the conversion of the shareholder loan.
 
The expected volatility of our future ordinary share price was based on the price volatility of the shares of 11 comparable companies in the PV manufacturing business, which are listed and publicly traded over the most recent period, equal to the expected maturity period of the issued warrants. These companies were used for comparative purposes because we did not have a trading history at the time the warrants were issued and therefore did not have sufficient share price history to calculate our own historical volatility. The selection of such comparable companies is highly subjective. The estimated fair value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant was determined by contemporaneous valuations as of their respective measurement dates, performed by American Appraisal, as set forth in its valuation reports, both dated March 30, 2007, for the valuation of our share options and unvested restricted shares as of December 31, 2006 and January 19, 2007, respectively, supplemented by the forecasted profitability and cash flows of our business.
 
We believe that the increase in the fair value of our ordinary shares since the issuance of Series A preferred shares at US$2.04 on September 28, 2006 to the issuance of Series B preferred shares at US$4.74 on December 20, 2006, is attributable to the following significant factors and events occurred between September 28, 2006 and December 20, 2006:
 
 	• 	in November 2006, we successfully completed the issuance of mandatory redeemable bonds and mandatory convertible bonds for an aggregate principal amount of US$85 million, which were used primarily to purchase 150 tons of polysilicon in November and December 2006 and satisfy US$32.6 million of prepayment obligations payable in December 2006 under two long-term polysilicon supply contracts with Wacker Chemie AG. The execution of these contracts and other bulk purchases improved our ability to secure the requisite amount of polysilicon and supported the credibility of our output projections and our confidence to obtain necessary polysilicon supply for 2007 and onwards, which in turn helped to improve our valuation from the time of the issuance of the Series A preferred shares in September 2007 to the time of the issuance of the Series B preferred shares in December 2006;

 	• 	in November 2006, we entered into a large sales contract with Acciona Energía, S.A., one of our key customers in Spain, for the delivery of an aggregate of 42 megawatts of PV modules until 2008, which helped to further strengthen our competitive position, improve the accuracy of our average selling price projections, further justify our capacity expansion plan and support our revenue projections. Such contract may not be unilaterally terminated by Acciona, except in limited circumstances, such as bankruptcy of us or a breach of the contract which remains uncured for 60 days after notice thereof;
 
 	• 	the prices of polysilicon we were able to obtain under these long-term polysilicon supply contracts also supported our belief that the polysilicon price over the long term would fall significantly and, as a result, our gross profit margin would improve over the long term;
 
 	• 	we were able to hire the chief financial officer, chief operating officer, chief technology officer and financial controller, who helped us to enhance our management capabilities and to execute our business plan; and
 
 	• 	in light of the greater immediacy of our public offering and the paucity of successful initial public offerings by issuers with principal operating subsidiaries in China from September 2006 through December 2006, we adjusted down the weighted average cost of capital by 2% from September 2006 through December 2006 as the cost of equity had been reduced.
 
In addition, we believe the increase in the fair value of our ordinary shares is consistent with the increase in the price paid by third party investors for our shares from US$2.10 per ordinary share, as determined by the Series A preferred investor in September 2006, to US$4.835 per share ordinary share, as determined by the Series B preferred investor in December 2006, each based on the initial conversion rates of one Series A preferred share per ordinary share and one Series B preferred share per ordinary share. We believe that the increase in the consideration paid by third-party investors for our shares was indicative of an increase in our enterprise value as recognized by third parties.
 
Warranty Costs
 
Our PV modules are typically sold with a two-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a 10-year and 25-year limited warranty against declines of more than 10.0% and 20.0% of initial power generation capacity, respectively. Our PV system sales are typically sold with a one- to five-year warranty against defects in our modules, storage batteries, controllers and inverters. We provide for the estimated cost of each warranty at the time revenue is recognized. However we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold our products and recognized revenues. Because we have sold PV modules only since January 2003, and none of our PV modules has been in use for more than five years, we have a limited warranty claim period. We perform industry-standard testing to test the quality, durability and safety of our products. As a result of such tests, we believe the quality, durability and safety of our products are within industry norms. Based on the results of the industry standard testing and consideration given to the warranty accrual practice of other companies in the same business, we record the equivalent of 1% of net revenues as a warranty liability to accrue the estimated cost of our warranty obligations. Actual warranty costs will depend on a variety of factors including actual failure rates, material and product delivery cost at time of failure, and other costs incurred to fulfill the obligation to replace or repair the product. To the extent that warranty costs differ significantly from the estimates, we will revise our warranty provisions accordingly. Any such revisions to our accrued warranty liability will affect our results of operations in the period the revision is made as well as subsequent periods to the extent the amount of estimated warranty provisions of 1% of related sales revenues is adjusted.
 
Long-Lived Assets
 
As of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, our intangible assets primarily consisted of technical know-how, customer relationships, long-term supplier agreements and trademarks that were acquired in connection with our acquisitions of minority interests of 2.98%, 8.15% and 7.98% in

Table of Contents

Tianwei Yingli on November 20, 2006, December 18, 2006 and June 25, 2007, respectively. We allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition, which we refer to as the purchase price allocation. As part of the purchase price allocation, we are required to determine the fair value of any intangibles acquired.
 
The determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future. The fair values as of November 20, 2006, December 18, 2006 and June 25, 2007, respectively, of the intangible assets acquired were also determined by American Appraisal, as set forth in its valuation reports dated March 30, 2007 (for the valuation of such intangible assets as of November 20, 2006 and December 18, 2006) and August 8, 2007 (for the valuation of such intangible assets as of June 25, 2007). For technical know-how, the fair value was determined based on the excess-earning approach using the present value of the projected earnings attributable to the technical know-how. For customer relationships, the fair value was based on the excess earnings which take into consideration the projected cash flows to be generated from these customers. Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of these customers which has taken into consideration historical customer attrition and revenue growth. The resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating our weighted average cost of capital. For long-term supplier agreements, the fair value was based on the discounted present value of the difference between the price of polysilicon as agreed in the supplier agreements and market price. For trademarks, the fair value was based on the “relief from royalty” approach representing the present value of the after-tax cost savings from royalty payments.
 
We depreciate and amortize our property, plant, equipment and intangible assets, using the straight-line method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of plant and equipment (including the salvage values) in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during each reporting period. We estimate the useful lives at the time the assets are acquired based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, we might shorten the useful lives assigned to these assets, which would result in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in the future periods. There has been no change to the estimated useful lives or salvage values during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007.
 
We evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. We estimate the fair value of the asset based on the best information available, including prices for similar assets and in the absence of an observable market price, the results of using a present value technique to estimate the fair value of the asset. For our trademarks which are not subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. For the periods presented, no impairment on our long-lived assets was recorded.
 
Share-Based Compensation
 
As further described in Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we account for share-based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123-R, “Share-Based Payment”, or SFAS No. 123R. Under SFAS No. 123R, the cost of all share-based payment transactions must be recognized in our consolidated financial statements based on their grant-date

fair value over the required period, which is generally the period from the date of grant to the date when the share compensation is no longer contingent upon additional service from the employee, or the vesting period. We determine the fair value of our employees’ share options as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
 
Under this model, we make a number of assumptions regarding the fair value of the options, including:
 
 	• 	the estimated fair value of our ordinary shares on the grant date for options granted prior to our initial public offering;
 
 	• 	the maturity of the options;
 
 	• 	the expected volatility of our future ordinary share price;
 
 	• 	the risk-free interest rate, and;
 
 	• 	the expected dividend rate.
 
Prior to our initial public offering, for the purpose of determining the estimated fair value of our share options that have been granted, we believe that the expected volatility and the estimated share price of our ordinary shares are the most critical assumptions since we were a privately-held company on the date we granted our options. The estimated fair value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant was determined based on valuation also performed by American Appraisal on our ordinary shares, as set forth in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007, for the valuation of our share options as of December 31, 2006, supplemented by the forecasted profitability and cash flows of our business. American Appraisal estimated the expected volatility of our future ordinary share price based on the price volatility of the publicly traded ordinary shares of 11 comparable companies in the PV manufacturing business whose shares are publicly traded over the most recent period to be equal to the expected option life of our employees’ share option.
 
For the share options granted after our initial public offering, the fair value of our ordinary share on the grant date is determined by the closing trade price of our ordinary shares on the grant date. Since we did not have a sufficient trading history at the time the options were issued, we estimated the expected volatility of our ordinary share price by referring to 11 comparable companies in the PV manufacturing business whose shares are publicly traded over the most recent period to be equal to the expected option life of our employees’ share option.

On January 19, 2007, we granted 2,576,060 unvested restricted shares under our 2006 stock incentive plan for the benefit of 68 participants, consisting of 1,576,300 unvested restricted shares granted to eight directors and officers of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli and 999,760 unvested restricted shares granted to 60 other employees of us. Share-based compensation expense with respect to the unvested restricted shares was measured based on the estimated fair value of our ordinary shares at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the five-year vesting period.
 
We recorded non-cash share-based compensation expenses of RMB 61,667 (or US$7,826 as translated at the applicable average exchange rate prevailing during the period) for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and RMB 18,542,335 (or US$2,420,371 as translated at the applicable average exchange rate prevailing during the period) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007.
 
For our share options issued on December 28, 2006, American Appraisal used an expected volatility of 70% and estimated fair values for our ordinary shares of US$4.74, resulting in estimated fair values of US$3.81 per option, as indicated in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007, for the valuation of the share options as of December 31, 2006. For our unvested restricted shares issued on January 19, 2007, American Appraisal estimated the fair value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant of US$4.96.
 
The fair value of our ordinary shares of US$4.74 and US$4.96 per share at the respective date of grant was determined based on contemporaneous valuations as of December 28, 2006 and January 19, 2007, performed by American Appraisal, as indicated in its valuation reports, both dated March 30, 2007, for the valuation of the share options and unvested restricted shares as of December 31, 2006 and January 19, 2007, respectively. The following describes the methodology and major assumptions used by American Appraisal, as set forth in its valuation reports, dated March 30, 2007.
 
Since our capital structure comprised of preferred shares and ordinary shares at the grant date, our enterprise value was allocated between each class of equity using an option pricing method. The option pricing method treats ordinary shares and preferred shares as call options on the enterprise value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the preferred shares.

American Appraisal used a weighted average equity value derived by using a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flow method) and the market approach (guideline company method) and applied a 40% weight to the market approach and a 60% weight to the income approach to arrive at the fair value as of December 28, 2006 and January 19, 2007. There was no significant difference between the enterprise value of our valuation derived using the income approach and the enterprise value derived using the market approach.
 
For the market approach, the market profile and performance of eleven guideline companies with businesses similar to those of us were considered. American Appraisal used information from the eleven listed guideline companies to derive market multiples. The eleven guideline companies identified were: Energy Conversion Devices, Inc, E-Ton Solar Tech Co Ltd, Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd, Solar Fabrik AG, Sunways AG, Solarworld AG, Solon AG, Q-Cells AG, Motech Industries Inc, SunPower Corporation and Ersol Solar Energy AG. American Appraisal then calculated the following three multiples for the guideline companies: the enterprise value to sales multiple, the EBITDA multiple and the EBIT multiple. Due to the different growth rates, profit margins and risk levels of the Company and the guideline companies, price multiple adjustments were made. The 2007 adjusted average price multiples of the guideline companies were used in the valuation of our enterprise value.
 
For the income approach, a DCF analysis was used based on our projected cash flows from 2006 through 2010. American Appraisal used a WACC of 18.0% as of December 28, 2006 and January 19, 2007, respectively, based on the WACC of the guideline companies.
 
A discount for lack of marketability of 11% and 9% as of December 28, 2006 and January 19, 2007, respectively, was also applied to reflect the fact that there is no ready market for shares in a closely held company, such as us. Because ownership interests in closely held companies are typically not readily marketable compared to similar public companies, we believe a share in a privately held company is usually worth less than an otherwise comparable share in a publicly held company and therefore applied a discount for the lack of marketability of the privately held shares. When determining the discount for lack of marketability, the Black-Scholes option model was used. Under option pricing method, the cost of the put option, which can hedge the price change before the privately held shares can be sold, was considered as a basis to determine the discount for lack of marketability. The option pricing method was used because this method takes into account certain company-specific factors, including the size of our business and volatility of the share price of comparable companies engaged in the same industry. Volatility of 58% and 45% as of December 28, 2006 and January 19, 2007, respectively, was determined by using the mean of volatility of the guideline companies used in the market approach.
 
Changes in our estimates and assumptions regarding the expected volatility and valuation of our ordinary shares could significantly impact the estimated fair values of our share options and, as a result, our net income and the net income available to our ordinary shareholders.
 
We believe that the increase in the fair value of our ordinary shares since the grant of options on December 28, 2006 to US$11.00 per share, the initial public offering price of our ordinary shares, was attributable to the following significant factors and events from December 28, 2006 to June 7, 2007 (the date of our initial public offering):
 
 	• 	from December 26, 2006 to June 7, 2007, we had entered into three sales contracts with Unitec Europa, S.A., Sinolink Development Limited and Laxtron Energías Renovables to deliver an aggregate of over 40 megawatts of PV modules in 2007, which increased our estimated sales in 2007 to be secured contractually from approximately 70 megawatts of PV modules as of December 28, 2006 to approximately 110 megawatts as of May 18, 2007.
 
 	• 	from December 28, 2006 to June 7, 2007, we had secured additional supply of polysilicon. In April 2007, we entered into a new supply agreement with Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Science and Technology Co., Ltd., a PRC silicon manufacturer, to satisfy a significant portion of our estimated polysilicon needs for 2007 and 2008 and further enhanced the credibility of our

98

Table of Contents

 		output projections for 2007 and 2008, as well as several other supplier contracts in 2007. As a result, we secured as of April 30, 2007 approximately 930 tons of our estimated polysilicon needs for 2007 and approximately 1,000 tons of our estimated polysilicon needs for 2008. In contrast, as of December 28, 2006, we secured approximately 380 tons of our estimated polysilicon needs for 2007 and nil tons for our estimated polysilicon needs for 2008.
 
 	• 	in March 2007, we successfully added another 30 megawatts cell production capacity which enabled us to reach the current PV cell production capacity of 90 megawatts. This addition in PV cell production capacity enhanced the parity of production capacity at each of our entire supply chain and reduced the need to enter into toll manufacturing arrangements with third-party toll manufacturers, which are more expensive than in-house production;
 
 	• 	from January 2007 through March 2007, we obtained additional banking facilities in the amount of RMB 441.7 million (US$58.9 million), sufficient for us to fund the construction for new production facilities for the silicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules for up to 100 megawatts each as well as the related power generation system until the end of June 2007. The availability of additional funding for capacity expansion increased the likelihood of achieving our output target for 2007 and 2008, as well as sales targets for 2007 and 2008, which in turn helped to improve our valuation. In addition, the production equipment had been delivered on schedule;
 
 	• 	in April 2007, we arranged for three individuals to become our independent directors upon completion of our initial public offering to help us improve our corporate governance and internal controls. In April 2007, we also hired a vice president with extensive experience in the silicon ingots and wafers production process and an assistant financial controller with knowledge of and experience in the areas of U.S. GAAP and internal control over financial reporting;
 
 	• 	from December 28, 2006 to June 7, 2007, governments in certain of our key overseas markets announced plans to promote the use of alternative and renewable energy sources, which is likely to improve the demand prospects for PV products significantly over the long term. These plans include the Energy Action Plan adopted by the European Council in March 2007, which, among others, set a binding target for the European Union to increase the percentage of energy consumption based on renewable energy sources to 20% of overall energy consumption in the European Union and to increase the percentage of biofuels used in the transport fuel consumed in the European Union to 10% of such transport fuel, in each case by 2020. In addition, the United States also announced a plan in January 2007 to seek a 20% reduction in gasoline consumption in the United States by 2017, which would likely require, among others, the use of approximately 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels. We believe the positive growth outlook for our products as a result of such government plans in turn improved our valuation;
 
 	• 	from December 28, 2006 to June 7, 2007, the stock prices of listed PV companies in general, including the 11 companies comparable to us that we examined in connection with the valuation performed by us with the assistance of American Appraisal, improved significantly. For example, the aggregate market capitalization of the 11 companies increased by approximately 30% from January 1, 2007 through May 8, 2007, based on an average increase of average closing stock prices during the same period. We believe that the favorable movements of the stock prices of the PV companies since the beginning of 2007 are due to, among others, the government plans to expand the use of renewable energy sources as described above, news reports in April 2007 that the global solar grade silicon supply is expected to increase significantly starting in 2008 (which exceeded the typical industry estimates made in 2006), and continued technological advancements for producing cheaper PV modules on a per-watt basis, which in the aggregate would contribute to the growth in revenue and profits for PV product manufacturers. We also believe that the investor sentiment

 		with respect to the PV company stocks were positively affected by the improvements in revenues and profits for several listed PV companies, such as Suntech Power Holdings and Solarworld AG. We believe that the strong stock price performance of the PV product manufacturers in general, including the 11 comparable companies we examined for purposes of valuation and several newly listed PV product manufacturers with operations primarily in China, further justify adjusting upwards the fair value of our ordinary shares; and
 
 	• 	in determining the initial public offering price of US$11.00 per share, we utilized the market approach, as compared to a weighted average of the income approach and market approach, which we used in determining the fair value of US$4.74 per share on December 28, 2006. We believed that applying the market approach best reflected our anticipated pricing for our initial offering. The most significant factors that led to an increase in the fair value of our ordinary shares from US$4.74 per share as of December 28, 2006 to US$11.00 per share, the initial public offering price of our ordinary shares, were: (i) the utilization of our estimated 2008 EBIT for purposes of calculating the initial public offering price for our initial public offering versus the utilization of 2007 EBIT for purposes of determining the fair value of US$4.74 per ordinary share as of December 28, 2006 and (ii) in light of the market factors described above, an increase by 75% in the multiple applied to such EBIT from December 28, 2006 for purposes of calculating the fair value of our ordinary shares as of June 7, 2007 for purposes of calculating the initial public offering price for our initial public offering.
 
Based on the initial public offering price of US$11.00 per share, the aggregated intrinsic value of the options outstanding as of December 31, 2006 was approximately US$5.44 million.
 
Valuation of Inventories
 
Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories in light of current market conditions and market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for a decline in net realizable value. The evaluation takes into consideration historic usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect that new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand. Furthermore, the price of polysilicon, our primary raw material, is subject to fluctuations based on global supply and demand. Our management continually monitors the changes in the purchase price paid for polysilicon, including prepayments to suppliers, and the impact of such change on our ability to recover the cost of inventory and our prepayments to suppliers. Our products have a long life cycle and obsolescence has not historically been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006, and the first nine months of 2007, inventory write-downs, which are included in cost of revenues, were RMB 0.7 million, RMB 0.6 million, RMB 1.7 million (US$0.2 million) and RMB 4.9 million (US$0.7 million), RMB 11.6 million (US$1.5 million), respectively.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated loss on receivables when collection may no longer be reasonably assured. We assess collectibility of receivables based on a number of factors including the customer’s financial condition and creditworthiness. We make credit sales to major strategic customers in Europe. To reduce credit risks relating to other customers, we require some of our customers to pay a major portion of the purchase price by letters of credit and require advance payments from some of our customers. Recently, the portion of our customers that are required to make advance payments has decreased. Because of the strong credit worthiness of our major European customers and the advance payment and the letter of credit payment requirements that we impose on certain of our other customers and healthy creditability of our major

customers, our allowance for doubtful accounts and provisions for bad debt have not been significant. Our accounts receivable balance had grown significantly from September 4, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and in the first nine months of 2007 due to sales to several major customers. We manage our credit risk by requiring those customers to pay a portion of the purchase price by letters of credit. As a result, our allowance for doubtful accounts did not increase significantly from September 4, 2006 through September 30, 2007. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006, our provision for doubtful accounts amounted to RMB 0.3 million, RMB 1.5 million, RMB 0.5 million (US$0.07 million), nil, respectively. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, our provision for doubtful accounts was reduced by RMB 0.07 million (US$9,348) resulting in a corresponding credit to earnings.
 
The following table presents the movement of allowance for doubtful accounts for 2004 and 2005 and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006,the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007:

Controls and Procedures
 
Prior to our initial public offering, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, our independent auditors identified a number of significant control deficiencies in our internal control procedures which, in the judgment of our independent auditors, adversely affect our ability to record, process and report financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. Specifically, the significant control deficiencies identified by our independent auditors consist of: (i) the lack of clear procedures, timetables, segregation of duty and review in the financial reporting process, (ii) failure to regularly reconcile the balances of accounts receivable and customer prepayments as recorded in our books and records with our customers, (iii) the lack of sub-ledgers to classify sales transactions by customer, (iv) the lack of process and related controls procedures relating to the recognition of accounts payable and reduction of advance payments,

101

Table of Contents

(v) failure to properly record all related party transactions and periodically update the list of such transactions and (vi) failure to properly record the transfer of construction-in-progress to fixed assets on our financial statements. None of the significant deficiencies discovered by our auditors were, individually or in combination with one another, material weaknesses as described in then effective Auditing Standard No. 2, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial Statements, of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Other than the remaining significant deficiencies discussed above, we also had in the past certain material weaknesses, which have since been remedied. In addition, in connection with our preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 included in this prospectus, certain other significant control deficiencies were identified, which consist of (i) the lack of sufficient controls to timely identify related party transactions and obtain proper pre-approval prior to entering into such transactions, (ii) the lack of sufficient internal review on the interim financial statement disclosure, including classification between operating cash flows and investing cash flows, disclosure of the estimated useful life of intangible assets, and disclosure of share-based payments, and (iii) the lack of process and related control procedures related to the accounting of intercompany foreign currency transactions, which resulted in the improper recognition of a RMB 13.5 million foreign currency exchange gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
 
In order to remedy the remaining significant deficiencies, we are undertaking several measures to further improve our internal control over financial reporting. We appointed a new chief financial officer and a new financial controller in the fourth quarter of 2006, both of whom have experience with and knowledge of U.S. GAAP. In October 2006, we hired Protiviti, an outside consulting firm, to review our internal control processes, policies and procedures in order to assist us in identifying weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We plan to provide further training to our financial and accounting staff to enhance their knowledge of U.S. GAAP. We are also adopting and implementing additional policies and procedures, including an enterprise resource planning system, to strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting. We plan to continue to take additional steps to remedy these significant deficiencies in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. These steps include (i) performing management testing on internal controls, (ii) hiring additional experienced internal auditors and (iii) conducting dry-run testing for compliance with Section 404. If, however, we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our ADSs and the value of the notes. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 
Results of Operations
 
The following table sets forth a summary of the unaudited results of operations of us and our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, for the periods indicated. In our discussion of the results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 and for the year ended December 31, 2006, we refer to certain line items in the statement of income as “combined” for comparative purposes. These combined amounts represent the addition of the amounts for certain income statement line items of Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, and the amounts for the corresponding income statement line items of us, for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30, 2006 or December 31, 2006, as applicable. For the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 4, 2006, during which the financial statements of the predecessor and those of Yingli Green Energy overlap, Yingli Green Energy did not

engage in any business or operations. The unaudited combined financial data for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 and for the year ended December 31, 2006 do not comply with U.S. GAAP or the rules relating to pro forma presentation. We are including these unaudited combined amounts to supplementally provide information which we believe will be helpful to gaining a better understanding of our results of operations and improve the comparative period-to-period analysis. These unaudited combined amounts do not purport to represent what our results of operations would have been in such periods if Yingli Group had transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to us on January 1, 2006.
 
In addition, for comparative purposes we discuss below our results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 and (i) our predecessor’s results of operations from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and the amount for the corresponding income statement line items of us for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30, 2006 for and (ii) the combined nine-month period ended September 30, 2006. Although our predecessor and we, on a consolidated basis, were engaged in the same business and operations, our respective results of operations may not be comparable since they are presented with respect to two distinctive legal entities.

Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2007 Compared to the Period from January 1, 2006 Through September 4, 2006 (the Predecessor Period in 2006) and the Period from August 7, 2006 (Date of Inception) Through September 30, 2006
 
Net Revenues.  Our total net revenues were RMB 2,606.2 million (US$347.8 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which increased significantly from the total net revenues of RMB 884.0 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 212.2 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, primarily due to increased sales of PV modules. We sold 91.6 MW of modules in the first nine months of 2007 compared to 28.4 MW and 6.7 MW of modules sold in the predecessor period in 2006 and in the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, respectively. Our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, as a domestic company, was subject to sales tax and surcharges at a percentage of value added tax until September 5, 2006. Consequently, for the predecessor period in 2006 and a portion of the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, Tianwei Yingli was subject to sales tax and surcharges at the rate of approximately 1% of gross revenues. On September 5, 2006, upon our reorganization, Tianwei Yingli’s tax status changed and it was no longer subject to such sales tax and surcharges.
 
Our PV module sales in Europe amounted to RMB 2,359.1 million (US$314.8 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which increased significantly from PV module sales in Europe of RMB 747.6 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 162.6 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, due principally to a continued strong growth in demand in Europe for PV modules. As a percentage of total net revenues, our PV module sales in Europe increased to 90.5% in the first nine months of 2007 from 84.6% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 76.6% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. Within Europe, there were also significant changes from the predecessor period in 2006 and the period from August 7, 2007 through September 30, 2006 to the first nine months of 2007. Our PV module sales in Germany in the first nine months of 2007 were RMB 599.0 million (US$79.9 million), or 23.0% of our total net revenues, which decreased from the PV module sales in Germany of RMB 602.8 million, or 68.2% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 75.8 million, or 35.7% of total net revenues, for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, primarily due to increased demand in Spain and Italy, where the demand for PV products is currently growing at a faster rate than in Germany. Our PV module sales in Spain in the first nine months of 2007 were RMB 1,486.2 million (US$198.4 million), or 57.0% of our total net revenues, which significantly increased from PV module sales in Spain of RMB 78.6 million, or 8.9% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 73.4 million, or 34.6% of total net revenues, for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, primarily as a result of our entering into a major PV module contract with Acciona S.A. in November 2006. Our PV module sales in Italy in the first nine months of 2007 were RMB 271.1 million (US$36.2 million), or 10.4% of our total net revenues, which significantly increased from PV module sales in Italy of RMB 1.6 million, or 0.1% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and nil for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006.
 
Our sales in China were RMB 49.3 million (US$6.6 million), or 1.9% of our total net revenues in the first nine months of 2007, which increased from sales in China of RMB 30.9 million, or 3.5% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 16.4 million, or 7.7% of total net revenues, for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. Our PV module sales in Hong Kong were RMB 103.8 million (US$13.9 million), or 4.0% of our total net revenues in the first nine months of 2007, as compared to RMB 83.8 million, or 9.5% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 29.9 million, or 14.1% of total net revenues, for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006.
 
In addition, our PV module sales in the United States increased significantly to RMB 35.8 million (US$4.8 million), or 1.4% of our total net revenues, in the first nine months of 2007 from RMB 0.01 million, or 0.0% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 0.2 million, or 0.1% of total net revenues, for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, primarily due to increased demand in the United States.

Net revenues from sales of PV systems were RMB 0.6 million (US$0.1 million), or 0.0% of total net revenues for the first nine months of 2007, as compared to RMB 0.9 million, or 0.1% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 0.3 million, or 0.1% of total net revenues, for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, in each case, from sales of PV systems in China which remains a relatively small market.
 
Other revenues amounted to RMB 20.2 million (US$2.7 million), or 0.8% of total net revenues, for the first nine months of 2007, RMB 26.6 million, or 3.0% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 15.4 million, or 7.3% of total net revenues, for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, in each case, primarily from the occasional sales of substandard PV cells and wafers. Other revenue as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 0.8% in the first nine months of 2007 from 3.0% in the predecessor period in 2006 and 7.3% in the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006 primarily due to the increase of PV module sales which decreased other revenue as a percentage of net revenue.
 
Cost of Revenues.  Cost of PV modules sales as a percentage of net revenues from PV modules was 76.8% in the first nine months of 2007, as compared to 68.4% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 75.1% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. This increase in cost of PV modules as a percentage of net revenues was primarily a result of an increase in costs of polysilicon. These factors more than offset a decrease in polysilicon usage per watt resulting from the production of thinner wafers and PV cells with higher conversion efficiencies for use in our PV modules.
 
Cost of PV systems sales as a percentage of net revenues from sales of PV systems was 85.4% for the first nine months of 2007 as compared to 111.8% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 31.8% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. The loss in the predecessor period in 2006 in an amount of RMB 0.1 million (US$0.01 million) was primarily due to several sales of PV systems in certain areas in the PRC at prices below the cost in order to establish presence of our PV products in those areas.
 
Gross Profit.  As a result of the factors described above, our gross profit was RMB 597.3 million (US$79.7 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which significantly increased from RMB 272.4 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 55.0 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. Our gross profit margin decreased to 22.9% for the first nine months of 2007 from 30.8% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 25.9% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. This decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to increased cost of polysilicon in the first nine months of 2007, and to a lesser extent, decreased average selling price.
 
Operating Expenses.  Our operating expenses were RMB 184.7 million (US$24.6 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which significantly increased from RMB 37.7 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 3.7 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to 7.1% for the first nine months of 2007 from 4.3% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 1.7% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006 for reasons described below.
 
 	• 	Selling expenses.  Our selling expenses were RMB 75.2 million (US$10.0 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which significantly increased from RMB 9.6 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 0.2 million in the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in marketing activities for our PV modules, sales commissions of RMB 25.6 million (US$3.4 million) paid to three sales agents in Spain, an increase in amortization expenses in an amount of RMB 11.5 million (US$1.5 million) for intangible assets consisting of customer relationship and backlog and an RMB 0.8 million (US$0.1 million) increase in share-based compensation expenses. As a result, selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 2.9% for the first nine

 		months of 2007 from 1.1% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 0.1% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006.
 
 	• 	General and Administrative Expenses.  Our general and administrative expenses were RMB 93.4 million (US$12.5 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which significantly increased from RMB 24.5 million in the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 3.0 million in the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. The increase in general and administrative expenses in the first nine months of 2007 was primarily due to a significant increase in the number of administrative staff and the hiring of senior executive officers related to the expansion of our operations, an RMB 16.9 million (US$2.3 million) increase in our share-based compensation expenses, and an increase in amortization expenses in an amount of RMB 15.8 million (US$2.1 million) for intangible assets relating to technology know-how which were allocated to general and administrative expenses. As a result, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 3.6% in 2007 from 2.8% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 1.4% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006
 
 	• 	Research and Development Expenses.  Our research and development expenses were RMB 16.1 million (US$2.1 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which significantly increased from RMB 3.7 million in the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 0.5 million in the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. The increase in research and development expenses in the first nine months of 2007 was primarily due to the increase in research and development activities in such period related to improving ingot and wafer production process and PV cell conversion efficiency. As a result, research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 0.6% for the first nine months of 2007, 0.4% for the predecessor period in 2006, and 0.2% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006.
 
Income from Operations.  Income from operations was RMB 412.6 million (US$55.1 million) in the first nine months of 2007, RMB 234.6 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 51.3 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. As a result of the cumulative effect of the above factors, the operating profit margin was 15.8% for the first nine months of 2007, 26.5% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 24.2% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006.
 
Interest Expense, Net.  Net interest expense was RMB 34.4 million (US$4.6 million) in the first nine months of 2007, reflecting primarily interest expenses relating to our mandatory convertible and mandatory redeemable bonds issued in the fourth quarter of 2006 amounted to RMB 26.4 million (US$3.5 million) as well as bank borrowings. Upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007, all of our mandatory convertible were converted and all of our mandatory redeemable bonds were redeemed. Net interest expense was from RMB 21.9 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 4.9 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, which consisted primarily of interest expenses incurred for bank borrowings.
 
Income Tax Expense/Benefit.  We recognized income tax benefit of RMB 2.3 million (US$0.3 million) in the first nine months of 2007, income tax expense of RMB 22.5 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and income tax expense of RMB 7.0 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. The income tax benefit in the first nine months of 2007 was primarily due to exemptions from the PRC national and local enterprise income tax to which Tianwei Yingli is entitled from the enterprise state income tax for its first two profitable years and a 50% reduction in the enterprise income tax rate in the subsequent three years, beginning from calendar year 2007. The income tax benefit recognized related to the recognition of deferred income tax assets with respect to temporary differences which are expected to be realized or settled during periods after the exemption from income tax expires. The effective tax rate was 10.8% for the predecessor period but increased to 15.5% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. As a “high

and new technology enterprise”, our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, was entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% for the predecessor period in 2006. The effective tax rate for the predecessor period was lower than the enterprise income tax rate primarily due to a tax credit of RMB 10.6 million from the purchase by Tianwei Yingli of China-made equipment. For the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006, our preferential enterprise income tax rate was 18% as a result of a change in our tax status into Sino-foreign equity joint venture as of September 5, 2006.
 
Minority Interest.  Minority interest was RMB 125.8 million (US$16.8 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which represents the income attributable to the ownership interest in Tianwei Yingli not held by us before June 25, 2007 of 37.87% and, as a result of our acquisition of an additional 7.98% interest in Tianwei Yingli, of 29.89% from June 25, 2007, as well as the 36% ownership interest in Chengdu Yingli not held by Tianwei Yingli until July 15, 2007. Minority interest was RMB (0.1) million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 19.1 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. Minority interest for the predecessor period in 2006 represents income attributable to the equity interest of Chengdu Yingli, a subsidiary of Tianwei Yingli, not held by Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited. In addition to the minority interest in Chengdu Yingli, minority interest for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006 also included minority interest attributable to the equity interest of Tianwei Yingli not held by us.
 
Net Income.  As a result of the cumulative effect of the above factors, our net income increased to RMB 250.6 million (US$33.4 million) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 as compared to RMB 186.2 million for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 19.1 million for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. Net income for first nine months of 2007 and the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006 excluded minority interest of RMB 125.8 million (US$16.8 million) and RMB 19.1 million, respectively, primarily attributable to the equity interest of Tianwei Yingli not held by us since one of the shareholders of Tianwei Yingli is not a shareholder of us and therefore the related net income was presented as minority interest. Our net profit margin amounted to 9.6% in the first nine months of 2007, 21.1% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 9.0% for the period from August 7, 2006 through September 30, 2006. The tax holiday had the impact of increasing our net income by RMB 69.3 million (US$9.2 million) and net income attributable to ordinary shareholders on a basic per share basis by RMB 0.79 (US$0.11) and on a dilutive per share basis by RMB 0.76 (US$0.10) in the first nine months of 2007. Prior to this period there was no tax exemption in place.
 
Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2007 Compared to Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2006 on a Combined Basis
 
Net Revenues.  Total net revenue increased significantly from RMB 1,096.2 million in the first nine months of 2006 to RMB 2,606.2 million (US$347.8 million) in the first nine months of 2007. This increase was primarily due to the increase of sales of PV modules resulting from our capacity expansion and market demand for our products. We sold 91.6 MW of modules in the first nine months of 2007 compared to 35.1 MW of modules sold in the first nine months of 2006. Our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, as a domestic company, was subject to sales tax and surcharges at a percentage of value added tax until September 5, 2006. Consequently, for most of the first nine months of 2006, Tianwei Yingli was subject to sales tax and surcharges at the rate of approximately 1% of gross revenues. On September 5, 2006, upon our reorganization, Tianwei Yingli’s tax status changed and it was no longer subject to such sales tax and surcharges.
 
The geographic distribution of our sales in the first nine months of 2007 changed significantly from that in the first nine months of 2006. Our sales in Europe amounted to RMB 2,359.1 million (US$314.8 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which significantly increased from the sales in Europe of RMB 910.2 million in the first nine months of 2006, due principally to a continued strong growth in demand in Europe for PV modules. As a percentage of total net revenues, our sales in Europe increased to 90.5% in the first nine months of 2007 from the sales in Europe of 83.0% in the first nine months of 2006. Within Europe, there were also significant changes from the first nine

months of 2006 to the first nine months of 2007. Our sales in Germany in the first nine months of 2007 was RMB 599.0 million (US$79.9 million), or 23.0% of our total net revenues, which significantly decreased from the sales in Germany of RMB 678.6 million, or 61.9% of total net revenues in the first nine months of 2006, primarily due to increased demand in Spain and Italy, where the demand for PV products is currently growing at a faster rate than in Germany. Our sales in Spain in the first nine months of 2007 was RMB 1,486.2 million (US$198.4 million), or 57.0% of our total net revenues, which significantly increased from the sales in Spain of RMB 152.0 million, or 13.9% of total net revenues in the first nine months of 2006, primarily as a result of our entering into a major PV module contract with Acciona S.A. in November 2006. Our PV module sales in Italy in the first nine months of 2007 were RMB 271.1 million (US$36.2 million), or 10.4% of our total net revenues, which significantly increased from PV module sales in Italy of RMB 1.6 million, or 0.1% of total net revenues in the first nine months of 2006.
 
Our sales in China were RMB 49.3 million (US$6.6 million), or 1.9% of our total revenues in the first nine months of 2007, which increased from the sales in China of RMB 47.3 million, or 4.3% of our total net revenues in the first nine months of 2006. Our PV module sales in Hong Kong were RMB 103.8 million (US$13.9 million), or 4.0% of our total revenues in the first nine months of 2007, as compared to RMB 113.7 million, or 10.4% of our total net revenues in the first nine months of 2006.
 
In addition, our PV module sales in the United States increased significantly to RMB 35.8 million (US$4.8 million), or 1.4% of our total net revenues in the first nine months of 2007, from RMB 0.2 million, or 0.0% of our total revenues in the first nine months of 2006 primarily due to increased demand in the United States.
 
Cost of Revenues.  Our cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased to 77.1% in the first nine months of 2007 from 70.1% in the first nine months of 2006. Such increase was primarily a result of an increase in costs of polysilicon. These factors more than offset a decrease in polysilicon usage per watt resulting from the production of thinner wafers and PV cells with higher conversion efficiencies for use in our PV modules.
 
Gross Profit.  As a result of the foregoing, gross profit was RMB 597.3 million (US$79.7 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which significantly increased from gross profit of RMB 327.4 million in the first nine months of 2006. Gross profit margin was 22.9% in the first nine months of 2007, which decreased from gross profit margin of 29.9% in the first nine months of 2006, primarily as a result of the rising cost of polysilicon. This decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to increased cost of polysilicon in the first nine months of 2007, and to a lesser extent, decreased average selling price.
 
Operating Expenses.  Operating expenses increased significantly to RMB 184.7 million (US$24.6 million) in the first nine months of 2007 from RMB 41.5 million in the first nine months of 2006, primarily due to increases in selling expenses and general and administrative expenses relating to our expanded sales and operations. Operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was 7.1% in the first nine months of 2007, which increased significantly from operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues in the first nine months of 2006, which was 3.8%.
 
 	• 	Selling Expenses.  Selling expenses increase significantly to RMB 75.2 million (US$10.0 million) in the first nine months of 2007 from RMB 9.8 million in the first nine months of 2006, primarily as a result of a significant increase in marketing activities for our PV modules, sales commissions of RMB 25.6 million (US$3.4 million) paid to three sales agents in Spain, an RMB 0.8 million (US$0.1 million) increase in share-based compensation expenses and an increase of RMB 11.5 million (US$1.5 million) amortization expenses for intangible assets consisting of customer relationship and backlog. Our selling expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 2.9% in the first nine months of 2007 from 0.9% in the first nine months of 2006.

 	• 	General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses increased significantly to RMB 93.4 million (US$12.5 million) in the first nine months of 2007 from RMB 27.5 million in the first nine months of 2006, primarily as a result of a significant increase in the number of administrative staff and the hiring of senior executive officers related to the expansion of our operations, an RMB 16.9 million (US$2.3 million) increase in our share-based compensation expenses, and an increase of amortization expenses in an amount of RMB 15.8 million (US$2.1 million) for intangible assets relating to technology know-how which were allocated to general and administrative expenses. As a result, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 3.6% in the first nine months of 2007 from 2.5% in the first nine months of 2006.
 
 	• 	Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses increased significantly to RMB 16.1 million (US$2.1 million) in the first nine months of 2007 from RMB 4.2 million in the first nine months of 2006, primarily due to an increased level of research and development activities relating to improving the ingot and wafer production process and PV cell conversion efficiency. As a result, research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 0.6% in the first nine months of 2007 from 0.4% in the first nine months of 2007.
 
Income from Operations.  As a result of the foregoing, income from operations was RMB 412.6 million (US$55.1 million) in the first nine months of 2007, an increase of 44.3% from RMB 285.9 million in the first nine months of 2006. Operating profit margin was 15.8% in the first nine months of 2007, which decreased from operating profit margin of 26.1% in the first nine months of 2006, primarily due to an increase in the price of polysilicon and a significant increase in operating expenses, which was partially offset by cost savings generated by increased economy of scale from the expansion of our operations and technological improvements in our manufacturing processes.
 
Interest Expense, Net.  Net interest expense increased to RMB 34.4 million (US$4.6 million) in the first nine months of 2007 from RMB 26.9 million in the first nine months of 2006, primarily due to an increase in bank borrowings and the interest paid on our mandatory convertible bonds and mandatory redeemable bonds issued in the fourth quarter of 2006 and amortization of discounts upon those bonds in an aggregate amount of RMB 26.4 million (US$3.5 million).
 
Income Tax Expense/Benefit.  Tianwei Yingli is entitled to exemptions from the PRC national and local enterprise income tax for from the enterprise state income tax for its first two profitable years and a 50% reduction in the enterprise income tax rate in the subsequent three years, beginning from calendar year 2007. Accordingly, we recorded income tax benefit of RMB 2.3 million (US$0.3 million) in the first nine months of 2007, as a result of an adjustment to our deferred tax assets and liabilities following the change in the tax status of Tianwei Yingli. In comparison, in the first nine months of 2006, we recorded an income tax expense of RMB 29.5 million at a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15%. The effective tax rate for our predecessor was 10.8% in the predecessor period, which was lower than the preferential tax rate of 15%, primarily due to a tax credit of RMB 10.6 million from the purchase by Tianwei Yingli of China-made equipment.
 
Minority Interest.  Minority interest was RMB 125.8 million (US$16.8 million) in the first nine months of 2007, which represents the income attributable to the ownership interest in Tianwei Yingli not held by us before June 25, 2007 of 37.87% and, as a result of our acquisition of an additional 7.98% interest in Tianwei Yingli, of 29.89% from June 25, 2007, as well as the 36% ownership interest in Chengdu Yingli not held by Tianwei Yingli until July 15, 2007. Minority interest was RMB 19.0 million in the first nine months of 2006.

The Period from January 1, 2006 Through September 4, 2006 (the Predecessor Period in 2006) and the Period from August 7, 2006 (Date of Inception) Through December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005
 
Net Revenues.  Total net revenues were RMB 884.0 million (US$118.0 million) for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 754.8 million (US$100.7 million) for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, in each case primarily from the sales of PV modules. Total net revenues in 2005 amounted to RMB 361.8 million. Our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, as a domestic company, was subject to sales tax and surcharges at a percentage of value added tax. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and the predecessor period in 2006, sales tax and surcharges were at the rate of approximately 1% of gross revenues. On September 5, 2006, as a result of our reorganization, Tianwei Yingli’s tax status changed and Tianwei Yingli was no longer subject to sales tax and surcharges, and as a result, our sales taxes and surcharges decreased from 1% for the predecessor period in 2006 to nil for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
 
Our PV module sales increased in the predecessor period in 2006, primarily as a result of our further expansion in Spain and Hong Kong. Our PV module sales in Spain as a percentage of total net revenues increased from 7.9% in 2005 to 8.9% for the predecessor period in 2006. Our sales growth in Spain was primarily attributable to increased demand from Acciona, our recent and currently largest customer in Spain, to which we started selling PV modules in 2005. Our sales in Hong Kong as a percentage of total net revenues increased from nil in 2005 to approximately 9.5% in the predecessor period in 2006, primarily as a result of the commencement of our sales in Hong Kong, which were based on referrals by our system integration customers in Europe, and the large trading volume of PV modules in the Hong Kong market. Our PV sales in Germany, our largest market, as a percentage of total net revenues increased from 66.1% in 2005 to 68.2% for the predecessor period in 2006, primarily as a result of laws and regulations favorable to the alternative energy industries, including PV industry, and, to a lesser extent, strengthening relationships with our existing customers. Our sales in the United States as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 1.8% in 2005 to nil for the predecessor period in 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the unit sale prices of the PV modules in the United States.
 
Our PV module sales for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 continued to reflect continued geographic diversification. Our sales in Spain as a percentage of total net revenues increased from 8.9% for the predecessor period in 2006 to 20.9% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, primarily due to an increase in sales to Acciona. Our sales in Germany as a percentage of total sales decreased from 68.2% for the predecessor period in 2006 to 53.9% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of capacity constraints and our decision to expand our presence in Spain. During the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, our sales in the United States as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 5.4% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 from nil in the predecessor period in 2006, primarily as a result of a rise in the unit sale prices of PV modules and the announcement in late 2006 of energy policies favorable to alternative energy.
 
Net revenues from sales of PV systems for the predecessor period in 2006 was RMB 0.9 million (US$0.1 million), or 0.1% of total net revenues, as compared to RMB 14.3 million (US$1.9 million), or 1.9% of total net revenues, for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Sales of PV systems as a percentage of total net revenue was primarily as a result of completion of a large PV system project in China in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net revenues from sales of PV systems amounted to RMB 8.1 million in 2005, or 2.2% of total net revenues. PV system sales as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 2.2% in 2005 to 0.1% in the predecessor period in 2006, primarily because the PV system projects in the predecessor period in 2006 were completed during the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. We defer revenue recognition until the time that the PV system projects are completed.

Other revenues amounted to RMB 19.7 million, or 5.5% of total net revenues, in 2005, RMB 26.6 million (US$3.5 million), or 3.0% of total net revenues, for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 66.4 million (US$8.9 million) or 8.8% of total net revenues for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, in each case, primarily from the occasional sales of raw materials. The increase in other revenues in the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the consummation of two major sales of raw materials in the fourth quarter of 2006. Other revenue as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 5.5% in 2005 to 3.0% in the predecessor period in 2006 primarily due to the increase of PV module sales as a percentage of net revenues which weighted other revenue as a percentage of net revenue down.
 
Cost of Revenues.  Cost of PV modules sales as a percentage of net revenues from PV modules decreased from 69.8% in 2005 to 68.4% for the predecessor period in 2006 but increased to 76.3% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The decrease from 2005 to the predecessor period in 2006 was primarily due to increased usage of less expensive reclaimable polysilicon material which resulted in lower production costs. The increase from the predecessor period in 2006 to the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our average cost of polysilicon per watt as a result of the rising market price of polysilicon. In both the predecessor period and the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, we purchased the majority of our polysilicon either through short-term supply arrangements or from the then-prevailing spot market. Prices under these short-term arrangements and in the spot market both rose continuously in the past few years due to industry-wide supply shortage. The effect of the unit cost increase of polysilicon was partially offset by a decrease in our polysilicon usage per watt because we were able to manufacture PV products with thinner and larger silicon wafer, achieve higher conversion efficiencies and improve operation efficiencies.
 
Cost of PV systems sales as a percentage of net revenues from sales of PV systems decreased from 111.8% for the predecessor period in 2006 to 69.3% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 primarily due to the higher margin attributable to a large PV system project completed in the fourth quarter of 2006. The loss in the predecessor period in 2006 in an amount of RMB 0.1 million (US$0.01 million) was primarily due to several sales of PV systems in certain areas in the PRC at prices below the cost in order to establish presence of our PV products in those areas.
 
Gross Profit.  As a result of the factors described above, the gross profit margin decreased from 30.8% for the predecessor period in 2006 to 23.8% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Our gross margin in 2005 was 29.9%. We estimate that our margin will be improved by approximately 1% in 2007 as a result of the exemption from sales tax and surcharges based on historical results.
 
Operating Expenses.  Operating expenses were 24.5 million in 2005, RMB 37.7 million (US$5.0 million) for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 47.7 million (US$6.4 million) for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased from 4.3% for the predecessor period in 2006 to 6.3% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 for reasons described below.
 
 	• 	Selling Expenses.  Selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 1.1% for the predecessor period in 2006, consistent compared to 2005, which amounted to 1.0%, and was 0.8% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of our net revenues for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 compared to the predecessor period in 2006 was primarily due to our increased economies of scale and our increased annualized revenue base which outpaced the growth of selling expenses and both of which made it possible for us to reduce our selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues, while increasing our annualized selling expenses in absolute dollar amount.
 
 	• 	General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 5.3% in 2005, 2.8% for the predecessor period in 2006 and

 		2.9% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues from 2005 to the predecessor period in 2006 was primarily due to our increased economies of scale and our increased annualized revenue base in the predecessor period in 2006. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net revenues from the predecessor period in 2006 to the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses as we hired additional personnel and incurred additional professional expenses to support our operations in the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
 
 	• 	Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the predecessor period in 2006, which amounted to 0.4%, was consistent compared to 2005, which was 0.5%. Research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to 2.6% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, primarily due to the increase in research and development activities in such period related to improving ingots and wafers production process and output efficiency.
 
Income from Operations.  Income from operations was RMB 83.7 million in 2005, RMB 234.6 million (US$31.3 million) for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 132.3 million (US$17.7 million) for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. As a result of the cumulative effect of the above factors, the operating profit margin was 26.5% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 17.5% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The operating profit margin amounted to 23.1% in 2005.
 
Interest Expense, Net.  Net interest expense was RMB 5.0 million in 2005, RMB 21.9 million (US$2.9 million) for the predecessor period in 2006, which consisted primarily of interest expenses incurred for bank borrowings. Net interest expense was RMB 25.2 million (US$3.4 million) for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, which consisted primarily of interest expense incurred for the mandatory convertible bonds and the mandatory redeemable bonds issued on November 13, 2006, and to a lesser extent from interest expenses incurred for bank borrowings.
 
Income Tax Expense.  Income tax expense was RMB 12.7 million in 2005, RMB 22.5 million (US$3.0 million) for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 23.0 million (US$3.1 million) for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The effective tax rate was 10.8% for the predecessor period but increased to 23.4% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. As a “high and new technology enterprise”, our predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, was entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% for the predecessor period in 2006. The effective tax rate for the predecessor period was lower than the enterprise income tax rate primarily due to a tax credit of RMB 10.6 million (US$1.4 million) from the purchase by Tianwei Yingli of China-made equipment. For the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, our preferential enterprise income tax rate was 18% as a result of a change in our tax status as a Sino-foreign equity joint venture as of September 5, 2006. The effective tax rate for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 of 23.4% was higher than the enterprise income tax rate of 18.0% during the same period. During the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, we recognized tax expenses of RMB 4.0 million (US$0.5 million) as a result of an adjustment to our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in our tax status. In addition, during the same period, Yingli Green Energy was incorporated in the Cayman Islands to hold the equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Under current tax laws, Yingli Green Energy is not subject to income tax. As a result, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by expenses incurred by Yingli Green Energy, which were not tax deductible. Such increase in our effective tax rate was partly offset by RMB 1.8 million (US$0.2 million) tax credits in connection with certain research and development activities for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
 
Minority Interest.  Minority interest was RMB (0.1) million (US$(0.01) million) for the predecessor period in 2006 and was RMB 45.3 million (US$6.0 million) for the period from August 7,

113

Table of Contents

2006 through December 31, 2006. Minority interest for the predecessor period in 2006 represents income attributable to the equity interest of Chengdu Yingli, a subsidiary of Tianwei Yingli, not held by Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited. In addition to the minority interest in Chengdu Yingli, minority interest for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 also included minority interest attributable to the equity interest of Tianwei Yingli not held by us. Minority interest was RMB (0.04) million in 2005.
 
Net Income.  Net income was RMB 66.0 million in 2005, RMB 186.2 million (US$24.9 million) for the predecessor period in 2006 and RMB 30.0 million (US$4.0 million) for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Net income for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006 excluded minority interest of RMB 45.3 million (US$6.0 million), primarily attributable to the equity interest of Tianwei Yingli not held by us since one of the shareholders of Tianwei Yingli is not a shareholder of us and therefore the related net income was presented as minority interest. As a result of the cumulative effect of the above factors, net profit margin amounted to 18.2% in 2005, 21.1% for the predecessor period in 2006 and 4.0% for the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
 
Year Ended December 31, 2006 on a Combined Basis Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005
 
Net Revenues.  Total net revenues increased significantly from RMB 361.8 million in 2005 to RMB 1,638.8 million (US$218.7 million) in 2006, due primarily to a significant increase in the sales of PV modules.
 
Net revenues from sales of PV modules increased significantly from RMB 334.0 million in 2005 to RMB 1,530.6 million (US$204.3 million) in 2006, due primarily to a significant increase in the volume of PV modules sold from 11.9 megawatts in 2005 to 51.3 megawatts in 2006, which resulted mainly from a significant increase in our capacity and market demand for our PV modules, especially in Germany and other European markets. Our sales in Europe significantly increased from RMB 296.0 million, or 81.2% of our total revenues, in 2005 to RMB 1,334.2 million (US$178.1 million), or 80.9% of our total revenues, in 2006, due to the significant increase in market demand in Europe, particularly in Germany, following the adoption of several government incentives for PV products in Europe. Our sales in China increased from RMB 57.3 million in 2005 to RMB 81.0 million (US$10.8 million) in 2006, but as a percentage of our total revenues, our sales in China decreased from 15.7% in 2005 to 4.9% in 2006, primarily due to the rapid expansion of the European market for PV products and the management’s continued focus on the international market. The increase in net revenues from sales of PV modules was, to a lesser extent, also attributable to an increase in the average selling price per watt of our PV modules from US$3.49 in 2005 to US$3.82 in 2006, which reflected increased market demand for PV modules.
 
Net revenues from sales of PV systems increased by 88.2% from RMB 8.1 million in 2005 to RMB 15.2 million (US$2.0 million) in 2006, due primarily to our sale and delivery of a PV system in connection with a large PV system project in China.
 
Other revenues increased significantly from RMB 19.7 million in 2005 to RMB 93.0 million (US$12.4 million) in 2006, primarily due to an increase in occasional sales of raw materials, which we expect will not be significant in the future.
 
Cost of Revenues.  Cost of revenues increased significantly from RMB 253.6 million in 2005 to RMB 1,186.5 million (US$158.3 million) in 2006. The increase in cost was a result of the significant increase in the volume of PV modules we sold and, to a lesser extent, by an increase in unit costs of polysilicon and increased depreciation expense. The average cost of polysilicon per kilogram we purchased increased by 185.5% from 2005 to 2006 due to industry-wide supply shortages and the rising market price of polysilicon. The effect of the increase in the unit cost for polysilicon was partially offset by a decrease in silicon usage per watt because we produced thinner wafers for use in our PV products, manufactured PV cells with higher conversion efficiencies and used a higher proportion of

inexpensive polysilicon scraps in 2006 compared to 2005. Depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of the build-up of new machinery required for our manufacturing capacity expansion.
 
Cost of PV modules sales increased significantly from RMB 233.2 million in 2005 to RMB 1,100.4 million (US$146.9 million) in 2006, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with increased net revenues from sales of PV modules, an increase in the price of polysilicon, and the increased use of toll manufacturing for PV cells. As a result, cost of PV modules sales as a percentage of net revenues from PV modules also increased from 69.8% in 2005 to 71.9% in 2006.
 
Cost of PV systems sales increased by 73.8% from RMB 6.3 million in 2005 to RMB 10.9 million (US$1.5 million) in 2006, due primarily to the increased sales of PV systems from involvement with a large project in China. Cost of PV systems sales as a percentage of net revenues from sales of PV systems decreased from 77.8% in 2005 to 71.8% in 2006, primarily due to the diversification of our system sales from mostly installation services in 2005 to more PV system integration services in 2006, which involves not only design and installation, but also the resale of peripheral parts and components for the integrated PV systems procured from third parties, a service that carries a lower margin than installation services.
 
Cost of other revenues increased from RMB 14.1 million in 2005 to RMB 75.2 million (US$10.0 million) in 2006, due primarily to the increase in other revenues. Cost of other revenues as a percentage of other revenues increased from 71.7% in 2005 to 80.9% in 2006, due primarily to a narrowing margin in sales of raw materials, such as polysilicon scraps not used by us, which we do not expect to be significant in the future.
 
Gross Profit.  Gross profit increased significantly from RMB 108.2 million in 2005 to RMB 452.3 million (US$60.4 million) in 2006. Our gross profit margin decreased from 29.9% in 2005 to 27.6% in 2006, primarily as a result of the rising cost of polysilicon, which outpaced the rising sales price of PV modules, and the increased use of toll manufacturing arrangement for PV cell production.
 
Operating Expenses.  Operating expenses increased significantly from RMB 24.5 million in 2005 to RMB 85.4 million (US$11.4 million) in 2006, primarily due to increases in selling expenses and general and administrative expenses relating to our expanded sales and operations. Operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 6.8% in 2005 to 5.2% in 2006, reflecting increased economies of scale in our operations following the expansion of our production capacity.
 
 	• 	Selling Expenses.  Selling expenses increased significantly from RMB 3.5 million in 2005 to RMB 15.5 million (US$2.1 million) in 2006, due primarily to increased revenues over the same period. Selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained largely stable from 1.0% in 2005 to 0.9% in 2006.
 
 	• 	General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses increased by 143.9% from RMB 19.2 million in 2005 to RMB 46.8 million (US$6.2 million) in 2006, due primarily to an increase in the number of administrative staff and the hiring of senior executive officers from 2005 to 2006 related to the expansion of our operations and their travel and other expenses, advisory fees related to financing arrangements and miscellaneous bank charges related to increased financing activities. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 5.3% in 2005 to 2.9% in 2006, primarily due to increased economies of scale in our operations following the expansion of our production capacity.
 
 	• 	Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses significantly increased from RMB 1.8 million in 2005 to RMB 23.1 million (US$3.1 million) in 2006, primarily due to the increased level of research and development activities relating to PV cell production and the calibration of the optimal silicon mix.
 
Income from Operations.  As a result of the foregoing, our income from operations significantly increased from RMB 83.7 million in 2005 to RMB 366.9 million (US$49.0 million) in 2006.

Our operating profit margin slightly decreased from 23.1% in 2005 to 22.4% in 2006, primarily due to an increase in the price of polysilicon which outpaced the cost savings generated by an increased economy of scale from the expansion of our operations and technological improvements in our manufacturing processes.
 
Interest Expense, Net.  Net interest expense significantly increased from RMB 5.0 million in 2005 to RMB 47.1 million (US$6.3 million) in 2006 due primarily to an increase in average bank borrowings, the interest in the aggregate amount of RMB 6.2 million (US$0.8 million) on our mandatory convertible bonds and mandatory redeemable bonds issued on November 13, 2006, and, to a lesser extent, to the increase in the weighted average interest rate for our short-term bank borrowings, which was 5.42% as of December 31, 2005 compared to 5.99% as of December 31, 2006.
 
Income Tax Expense.  Income tax expense significantly increased from RMB 12.7 million in 2005 to RMB 45.5 million (US$6.1 million) in 2006, due to a significant increase in taxable income. As a “high and new technology enterprise”, Tianwei Yingli was entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% in 2005 and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006. For the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006, our preferential enterprise income tax rate was 18% as a result of a change in our tax status as a Sino-foreign equity joint venture as of August 7, 2006 (date of inception). Our effective tax rate was 16.2% and 14.8% in 2005 and 2006, respectively. In 2005, our effective tax rate was higher than the statutory preferential tax rate of 15% primarily due to certain salary and benefit expenses that were non-deductible for PRC income tax purposes. In 2006, our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory preferential tax rate of 18% primarily due to a tax refund in the amount of RMB 10.6 million (US$1.4 million) from the purchase by Tianwei Yingli of China-made equipment and the impact from the application of the preferential tax rate of 15% for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, which was partially offset by non-tax deductible expenses incurred by Yingli Green Energy.
 
Minority Interest.  Our results for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006 are presented based on our ownership interest in Tianwei Yingli, which ranged from 51% to 62.13%. Because we did not own 100% of the equity interest in Tianwei Yingli during the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006, the income attributable to the ownership interest not held by us is shown as “minority interest” in our consolidated statement of income for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006.
 
Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004
 
Net Revenues.  Total net revenues increased significantly from RMB 120.5 million in 2004 to RMB 361.8 million in 2005, due primarily to a significant increase in the sales of PV modules.
 
Net revenues from sales of PV modules increased significantly from RMB 108.8 million in 2004 to RMB 334.0 million in 2005, due primarily to a significant increase in the volume of PV modules sold from 4.7 megawatts in 2004 to 11.9 megawatts in 2005, which resulted mainly from a significant increase in our capacity and market demand for our PV modules, especially in Germany and other European markets. Our sales in Europe increased significantly from RMB 86.9 million in 2004 to RMB 296.0 million in 2005 primarily due to an increased recognition of our brand and acceptance of our products. The increase in net revenues from sales of PV modules was, to a lesser extent, also attributable to an increase in the average selling price per watt of our PV modules from US$2.83 per watt in 2004 and to US$3.49 per watt in 2005, following the general rise in market demand for PV modules.
 
Net revenues from sales of PV systems decreased by 8.0% from RMB 8.8 million in 2004 to RMB 8.1 million in 2005, due primarily to our involvement with a fewer number of PV system projects in China and growing competition for sales of small stand-alone PV system applications in China.

Other revenues increased significantly from RMB 2.9 million in 2004 to RMB 19.7 million in 2005, due primarily to the larger volume of polysilicon scraps sold and the commencement of a transaction with a PRC trading company, for which we processed PV cells into PV modules. We entered into this contract in order to better utilize our PV module manufacturing capacity, which at the time was in excess of our capacity for PV cells in 2005. We currently have no plan to enter into similar processing transactions once our manufacturing capacities for ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules reach parity.
 
Cost of Revenues.  Cost of revenues increased significantly from RMB 95.3 million in 2004 to RMB 253.6 million in 2005. The increase in cost of revenues was due primarily to the significant growth of our sale of PV modules and the corresponding increase in our expenditures on polysilicon, an increased use of toll manufacturing and direct labor and overhead costs. The average cost of polysilicon feedstock we purchased increased by 106.5% from 2004 to 2005. We also experienced an increase in depreciation expenses due primarily to installation of new machinery required for our manufacturing capacity expansion.
 
Cost of PV modules sales increased by 169.6% from RMB 86.5 million in 2004 to RMB 233.2 million in 2005, due primarily to an increase in costs associated with increased net revenues from sales of PV modules and a substantial increase in the price of polysilicon. Cost of PV modules as a percentage of net revenues from sales of PV modules decreased from 79.5% in 2004 to 69.8% in 2005, due primarily to greater economies of scale, improvement in process technologies, and, to a less extent, the increase in the average selling price of PV modules in 2005.
 
Cost of PV systems sales decreased by 5.1% from RMB 6.6 million in 2004 to RMB 6.3 million in 2005, due primarily to the decrease in net revenues from sales of PV systems over the same period. Cost of PV systems sales as a percentage of net revenues from sales of PV systems increased from 75.4% in 2004 to 77.8% in 2005, primarily due to growing price competition for stand-alone PV system applications and the increase in the price of polysilicon.
 
Cost of other revenues significantly increased from RMB 2.2 million in 2004 to RMB 14.1 million in 2005, due primarily to the significant increase in sales of raw materials and the commencement of processing services in 2005 under a processing contract with a PRC trading company. Cost of other revenues as a percentage of other revenues decreased from 74.6% in 2004 to 71.7% in 2005, due primarily to the lower quality of polysilicon scraps purchased in 2005 compared to 2004 and the increase in the processing services in 2005, which had a higher profit margin than the sale of raw materials, which constituted the primary source of other revenues in 2004.
 
Gross Profit.  Gross profit significantly increased from RMB 25.2 million in 2004 to RMB 108.2 million in 2005, and the gross profit margin increased from 20.9% in 2004 to 29.9% in 2005, primarily due to a significant increase in our manufacturing capacity for ingots and wafers in 2005, which enabled us to reduce sourcing cost and achieve greater economies of scale in our manufacturing processes and improvement in manufacturing technologies.
 
Operating Expenses.  Operating expenses increased significantly from RMB 11.4 million in 2004 to RMB 24.5 million in 2005, due primarily to a significant increase in general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 9.5% in 2004 to 6.8% in 2005.
 
 	• 	Selling expenses.  Selling expenses increased significantly from RMB 1.0 million in 2004 to RMB 3.5 million in 2005, due primarily to increased advertising and other sales costs associated with the increased sales of PV modules. Selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained largely stable at 0.9% in 2004 and 1.0% in 2005.
 
 	• 	General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses increased by significantly from RMB 7.5 million in 2004 to RMB 19.2 million in 2005, due primarily to increased salaries associated with an 80.3% increase in administrative staff related to our expanded operations. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net

 		revenues decreased from 6.2% in 2004 to 5.3% in 2005, primarily due to greater economies of scale in our operations following the expansion of our production capacity.
 
 	• 	Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses decreased by 39.3% from RMB 3.0 million in 2004 to RMB 1.8 million in 2005, primarily due to the increase in government grants from the PRC government, which are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses and amounted to RMB 0.2 million and RMB 1.5 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Without taking into account such reductions, research and development expenses remained relatively stable from RMB 3.2 million in 2004 to RMB 3.3 million in 2005.
 
Income from operations.  Our income from operations significantly increased from RMB 13.7 million in 2004 to RMB 83.7 million in 2005. Our operating profit margin increased from 11.4% in 2004 to 23.1% in 2005, primarily due to the cost savings generated by an increased economy of scale from the rapid expansion of our operations and technological improvements in our manufacturing processes.
 
Interest Expense, Net.  Net interest expense decreased by 20.9% from RMB 6.3 million in 2004 to RMB 5.0 million in 2005, due primarily to a decrease in capitalization of interest expense following the completion of construction in 2005 and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of our short-term bank borrowings from 5.66% as of December 31, 2004 to 5.42% as of December 31, 2005.
 
Income Tax Expense.  Income tax expense significantly increased from RMB 1.2 million in 2004 to RMB 12.7 million in 2005, due primarily to a significant increase in taxable income as a result of higher profitability in 2005 compared to 2004. As a “high and new technology enterprise”, we were entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% in 2004 and 2005. The effective tax rate for us was 16.9% in 2004 and 16.2% in 2005, and was higher than the preferential tax rate of 15% primarily due to certain salary and benefit expenses that were non-deductible for PRC income tax purposes.
 
Net Income.  Net income significantly increased from RMB 6.1 million in 2004 to RMB 66.0 million in 2005, and the net profit margin increased from 5.1% in 2004 to 18.2% in 2005.
 
Selected Quarterly Results of Operations
 
The following table sets forth the consolidated selected quarterly results of operations of Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, and Yingli Green Energy for the quarterly period from the three months ended March 31, 2006 to the three months ended September 30, 2007. The quarterly financial data presented below are derived from unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements not included in this registration statement. For periods prior to September 5, 2006, the following discussion and analysis is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Tianwei Yingli and our view of its business and operations, and for periods including and subsequent to August 7, 2006 (date of inception), the following discussion and analysis is based on the consolidated financial statements of Yingli Green Energy. In our discussion of the results of operations for the third quarter of 2006, representing the period from July 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006, we refer to certain line items in the statement of income as “combined” for comparative purposes. The combined amounts represent the addition of the amounts for certain income statement line items of Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, for the period from July 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and the amounts for the corresponding income statement line items of us, for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30, 2006. The combined financial data for the third quarter of 2006 do not comply with U.S. GAAP. We are including these combined amounts to supplementally provide information which we believe will be helpful to gaining a better understanding of our quarterly results of operations and improve the comparative period-to-period analysis, each of which included a full calendar quarter. These combined amounts do not purport to represent what our quarterly results of operations would have been in such periods if Yingli Group transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to us on July 1, 2006. You should read the following table in conjunction with our

Note:
 
(1)		Represents the addition of the amounts for the specified financial statement line items of Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, for the period from July 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and the amounts for the corresponding line items of Yingli Green Energy, for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 30, 2006. The presentation of such combined financial data is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 4, 2006, during which the financial statements of the predecessor and those of Yingli Green Energy overlap, Yingli Green Energy did not engage in any business or operations.
 
(2)		In connection with the preparation of our unaudited third quarter 2007 financial results, we identified that due to an inadvertent error we had improperly recognized a non-cash foreign currency exchange gain of RMB 13.5 million in the second quarter of 2007 relating to an intercompany foreign currency transaction, which improperly reduced our foreign exchange loss from RMB 17.5 million to RMB 4.0 million. Specifically, since the intercompany foreign currency transaction, which involved certain shareholder loans extended from Yingli Green Energy to Tianwei Yingli, was of a long-term investment nature, the related foreign currency gains or losses should not have been recognized in the statement of income. As a result, our previously reported other expenses was restated to RMB 37.8 million from RMB 24.3 million. In addition, as a result of this correction, our previously reported net income before minority interest has been restated from RMB 123.7 million to RMB 110.2 million. The correction of this misstatement has no impact on our reported income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2007.
 
Our quarterly total net revenues have rapidly grown from the first quarter of 2006 as recorded by our predecessor to the last quarter of 2006, primarily due to the increase of sales of PV modules resulting from our capacity expansion, output increase and the increase in the average selling price of PV modules over the relevant periods. Our net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased significantly from that in the first quarter of 2006 as recorded by our predecessor, primarily due to the increase of sales of PV modules resulting from our capacity expansion and the increase in the average selling price of PV modules, principally due to the continued rise in demand for PV installations in 2006. Our net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased slightly from that in the third quarter of 2006 on a combined basis, primarily due to a decline in the average selling price of PV modules, resulting principally from intensified price competition among PV module manufacturers since the fourth quarter of 2006, which offset the slight increase of sales of PV modules and PV systems. Our net revenue in the first quarter of 2007 decreased from the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily due to a seasonal decrease in the demand of PV modules in our key markets, such as Germany and Spain. Our net revenue in the second quarter of 2007 increased from the first quarter of 2007 is mainly the result of output increase. Our net revenue in the third quarter of 2007 increased from the second quarter of 2007, mainly the result of our capacity expansion, output increase with slightly decrease of average selling price.

Our gross margin in the first quarter of 2006, which was 23.5%, were comparatively low due to the purchase for our PV module production of a limited amount of PV cells from third-party toll manufacturers, the cost of which was significantly higher than the PV cells produced by us in-house. Our gross margin in the second quarter of 2006, which was 35.7%, was high compared to other quarters in 2006 because we significantly reduced the use of the toll manufacturing arrangement following the commencement of the operations of our newly installed cell production facilities in such quarter. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2006, which was 23.0%, and the first quarter of 2007, which was 20.9%, were comparatively low, primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of silicon raw materials, which offset the decrease in silicon raw materials used per watt in our PV module production as the result of thinner silicon wafers we were able to produce and higher conversion efficiencies of PV cells and improved operation efficiencies we were able to achieve. Our gross margin in the second quarter of 2007 increased to 22.7% from 20.9% in the first quarter of 2007, mainly due to the decrease in cost of raw materials attributable to lower-priced polysilicon purchased by us under certain new supply contracts. Our gross margin in the third quarter of 2007 slightly increased to 23.7% from the second quarter of 2007, which is 22.7%. It is mainly due to the improved operation efficiency in wafer production line which offset the slightly decrease in average selling price in the third quarter of 2007.
 
Our operating expenses, which include selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, as a percentage of net revenue declined for the two quarters ended June 30, 2006, primarily as a result of our improved economies of scale. Our operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased between the third quarter of 2006 on a combined basis and the first quarter of 2007, primarily due to our increased marketing and sales initiatives in Spain, Italy and the United States, our continuous investment in research and development, our acquisition of additional equity interest in Tianwei Yingli in the fourth quarter of 2006 which resulted in additional intangible assets and higher amortization cost, and our hiring of new financial and administrative staff in preparation for our initial public offering. As a result, the amortization of intangible assets increased from RMB 1.5 million (US$0.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2006 to RMB 7.4 million (US$1.0 million) in the first quarter of 2007, sales commission increased from nil in the fourth quarter of 2006 to RMB 7.6 million (US$1.0 million) in the first quarter of 2007 as a result of sales commission paid to a sales agent in Spain for the execution of a sales contract, and the share-based compensation cost increased from RMB 61,667 (US$8,230), in the fourth quarter of 2006 to RMB 4.9 million (US$0.6 million) in the first quarter of 2007. We expect to continue to pay sales commission to our customer in Spain during the life of such sales contract. While we generally do not pay sales commission in connection with entering into a sales contract, we may pay sales commissions to other sales agents in the future. Our operating expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased from the first quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2007. The decrease of the percentage is primarily due to a seasonal decrease in the first quarter of 2007 in the demand of PV modules in our key markets, such as Germany and Spain. Such percentage did not change significantly from the second quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2007. The increase of the operating expense from the first quarter of 2007 to the second and third quarter of 2007 is mainly due to our increased marketing and sales activities in Spain, Italy and the United States, our continuous investment in research and development, our acquisition of additional equity interest in Tianwei Yingli in the end of second quarter of 2007 which resulted in additional intangible assets and higher amortization cost, and our hiring of new sales and administrative staff for the development of the our business. As a result, in the second and third quarter of 2007, the commission increased to RMB 8.4 million (US$1.1 million) and RMB 9.6 million (US$1.3 million), respectively, the amortization of intangible assets increased to RMB 7.4 million (US$1.0 million) and RMB 12.5 million (US$1.7 million), respectively, the share-based compensation cost increased to RMB 6.0 million (US$0.8 million) and RMB 6.8 million (US$0.9 million) respectively. We expect to continue to pay sales commission to our customer in Spain during the life of such sales contract. While we generally do not pay sales commission in connection with entering into a sales contract, we may pay sales commissions to other sales agents in the future.

Our income from operations has been growing from quarter to quarter over the three quarters ended September 30, 2006 largely due to our operational improvements. Our income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased significantly from that in the first quarter of 2006 as recorded by our predecessor, primarily due to the significantly higher net revenue in this quarter and an increase in gross margin, but decreased from that in the third quarter of 2006 on a combined basis, primarily due to an increase in the cost of silicon raw material and inventory write-down to net realizable value made during the fourth quarter of 2006. Our income from operations in the first quarter of 2007 increased from that in the first quarter of 2006 as recorded by our predecessor, primarily due to the significantly higher net revenue, which offset the decrease in gross margin and the increase in operating expenses, but decreased from that in the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily due to the decrease in gross margin and the increase in operating expenses. Our tax expenses significantly decreased in the first quarter of 2007 compared to previous quarters principally due to the commencement of a tax holiday on January 1, 2007. Our income from operations has been growing from the first quarter of 2007 to the second and third quarter of 2007, mainly due to the significantly increased net revenue and gross margin which offset the increase of operating expenses and an inventory write-down to net realizable value made during the third quarter of 2007.
 
Our operating results for these quarters are not necessarily indicative of results of any future quarter. See “Risk Factors — Our results of operations are difficult to predict, and if we do not meet the market expectation, the price of our ADS and the notes will likely decline”.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
In our discussion of the liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2006, we refer to certain line items on the statements of cash flows as “combined” for comparative purposes. These combined amounts represent the addition of the amounts for certain line items on the statements of cash flows of Tianwei Yingli, our predecessor, for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, and the amounts for the corresponding line items on our statements of cash flows for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006. For the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through September 4, 2006, during which the financial statements of the predecessor and those of Yingli Green Energy overlap, Yingli Green Energy did not engage in any business or operations. The combined financial data for the year ended December 31, 2006 do not comply with U.S. GAAP. We are including these combined amounts to supplementally provide information which we believe will be helpful to gaining a better understanding of our cash flows and improve the comparative analysis against the prior periods. These combined amounts do not purport to represent what our cash flows would have been in such periods if Yingli Group had transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to us on January 1, 2006.
 
In addition, we discuss below our liquidity and capital resources for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007.
 
Cash Flows and Working Capital
 
Prior to September 2006, we have relied principally on borrowings from financial institutions and related parties, to fund our operations and our capacity expansion. Substantially all such borrowings from financial institutions were guaranteed or entrusted by related parties. Under PRC laws, a company that is not a financial institution is not permitted to extend loans directly to another company. Therefore, a financial institution, such as a bank, typically becomes involved in loan arrangements between companies that are not financial institutions, by acting as an intermediary such that the financial institution receives the funds from the lending company and disburses the received funds to the borrowing company. Arranging a loan in this manner is referred to as “entrusting” a loan. In contrast, “guaranteeing” a loan involves a company’s guaranteeing the repayment of a loan made by another company to the lender of such loan.

From August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through January 13, 2007, in order to obtain additional sources of financing required for the expansion of our operation and production capacities in response to growing market demand for our PV products, we obtained financing from third parties through private placements of our equity and debt securities in an aggregate amount of US$220 million consisting of (i) US$17 million from the issuance of our Series A preferred shares, (ii) US$38 million from the issuance of the mandatory redeemable bonds, payable to Yingli Power, (iii) US$47 million from the issuance of the mandatory convertible bonds payable to Yingli Power and (iv) US$118 million from the issuance of our Series B preferred shares.
 
In June 2007, we completed our initial public offering of 26,550,000 ordinary shares in the form of ADSs and raised US$274,527,000 in proceeds, before expenses. On June 25, 2007, we used US$35.3 million from the net offering proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding mandatory redeemable bonds issued by us on November 13, 2006 to Yingli Power. On September 28, 2007, we lent US$230 million from the net offering proceeds to Tianwei Yingli to support its business expansion. This shareholder loan, which carries a term of 18 months and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 2%, will be converted into an equity contribution to increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, subject to government approvals, to 74.01%.
 
As of December 31, 2004 and 2005, we had a working capital deficit, defined as current liabilities less current assets, of RMB 70.1 million and RMB 231.1 million, respectively, while as of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, we had a working capital surplus (defined as current assets less current liabilities) of RMB 1,057.6 million (US$141.2 million) and RMB 2,379.0 million (US$317.5 million), respectively. We may have a working capital deficit in the future. The working capital deficits as of December 31, 2004 and 2005 were primarily due to our historical reliance on the proceeds of short-term loan facilities to meet our significant operating cash requirements and our commitments and significant capital expenditures in expanding our production capacities. The working capital surpluses as of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007 were primarily due to proceeds from the issuances of our equity and long-term debt securities, including through our initial public offering which were partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment and long-term prepayments to polysilicon suppliers. Our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time largely depends on the ability of our management to successfully execute our business plan (including increasing sales while decreasing operating costs and expenses) and, if required, the ability to obtain additional funds from third parties, including banks, and from our related parties or from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. Our management believes increased sales as we expand our market presence in Europe and other target markets as well as the proceeds from this offering and other financings entered into from time to time will enable us to fund our operational cash flow needs and meet our commitments and current liabilities, as and when they come due, for a reasonable period of time.
 
The primary sources of our financing have been borrowings from banks, our equity interest holders, other related parties and other third parties, and private placements of our debt and equity securities as well as our initial public offering. As of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, we had RMB 21.7 million, RMB 14.9 million and RMB 78.5 million (US$10.5 million) and RMB 263.0 million (US$35.1 million), respectively, in cash, RMB 0.7 million, RMB 14.9 million and RMB 321.8 million (US$42.9 million) and RMB 7.7 million (US$1.0 million), respectively, in restricted cash, RMB 92.0 million, RMB 346.8 million, RMB 267.3 million (US$35.7 million) and RMB 1,152.0 million (US$153.7 million), respectively, in outstanding short-term borrowings and RMB 8.1 million, RMB 100.4 million, RMB 31.8 million (US$4.3 million) and RMB 3.6 million (US$0.5 million), respectively, in outstanding borrowings from related parties. We did not have any long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2004, 2005, and as of September 30, 2007 but, as of December 31, 2006, had outstanding mandatory redeemable bonds payable to Yingli Power of RMB 293.1 million (US$39.1 million) and outstanding mandatory convertible bonds payable to Yingli Power of RMB 362.5 million (US$48.4 million), each of which carried a term of more than one

year. Such mandatory redeemable bonds and mandatory converted bonds were redeemed and converted, respectively, upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007.
 
Our cash consists of cash on hand, cash in bank accounts and interest-bearing savings accounts. Our restricted cash consists of bank deposits for securing letters of credit and letters of guarantee granted to us.
 
Our short-term borrowings from banks outstanding as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007 were RMB 92.0 million, RMB 279.0 million, RMB 255.3 million (US$34.1 million) and RMB 1,152.0 million (US$153.7 million), respectively, and bore a weighted-average interest rate of 5.66%, 5.42%, 5.99% and 5.91%, respectively. Such borrowings were made principally to fund prepayments to polysilicon suppliers and capital expenditure for our capacity expansion and to repay short-term borrowings. Our short-term borrowings from banks, some of which are guaranteed or entrusted by Tianwei Baobian, have a term of less than one year, expire at various times throughout the year. We have historically negotiated renewal of certain of these borrowings shortly before they mature.
 
All other borrowings from third parties (other than banks), which amounted to nil, RMB 67.7 million, RMB 12.0 million (US$1.6 million) and nil, respectively, as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, and September 30, 2007, were interest-free. Borrowings from non-financial institution third parties are unsecured, have no definite terms of repayment and are generally arranged personally by our founder, Mr. Liansheng Miao. In February 2007, we repaid in full a loan in the principal amount of RMB 12.0 million (US$1.6 million) borrowed from a government authority. In April 2007, we repaid in full a loan from a third party in the principal amount of RMB 5.0 million (US$0.7 million), which was interest-free.
 
We also had borrowings from Tianwei Baobian, the holder of the minority equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, the outstanding amount of which was RMB 8.0 million, RMB 100.3 million, nil, and nil as of December 31, 2004, 2005, 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Our borrowings from Tianwei Baobian were generally unsecured, interest-free and had no fixed term of repayment.
 
In addition, in 2006, we borrowed RMB 20.0 million (US$2.7 million) from Baoding Yuan Sheng Investment & Development Co. Ltd., or Yuan Sheng, a company 51% and 49% owned by Tianwei Group, the parent company of Tianwei Baobian, and Yingli Group, our controlling shareholder, respectively, which was repaid in full as of March 31, 2007. Such loan was interest-free and had no definitive terms of repayment. During the first nine months of 2007, Tianwei Yingli borrowed and repaid RMB 25.0 million (US$3.3 million) from Yuan Sheng. During the same period, Tianwei Yingli made loans to Yuan Sheng in the amount of RMB 2.0 million (US$0.3 million) which were unsecured and free of interest and without definitive terms of repayment. The full amount of these loans remained outstanding as of September 30, 2007.
 
We have historically been able to repay our borrowings mostly from refinancing or new or additional borrowings from our shareholders, related parties, other third parties as well as proceeds from our initial public offering. We may also seek additional debt or equity financing or to use some of the proceeds from this offering to repay the remaining portion of our borrowings. As we ramp up our current and planned operations in order to complete our expansion projects, we expect to generate cash from our expanded operations to repay a portion of our borrowings. If we are unable to obtain alternative funding or generate cash from our operations as required, our business and prospects may suffer. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry — We have significant outstanding short-term borrowings, and we may not be able to obtain extensions when they mature”.
 
We also received a substantial amount of funds generated by the private placements of our equity and debt securities, including Series A preferred shares, Series B preferred shares, mandatory redeemable bonds payable to Yingli Power and mandatory convertible bonds payable to Yingli Power issued during the period from September 2006 to January 2007. For a more detailed description of

these private placement transactions, see “Restructuring — Private Equity Investments and Other Financings Following the Restructuring”.
 
We had one obligation in the aggregate amount of RMB 30.0 million (US$4.0 million) that was overdue as of April 16, 2007, consisting of a repayment obligation to a provincial government authority in the PRC. We repaid this obligation in July 2007.
 
We have significant working capital commitments because suppliers of high purity polysilicon and polysilicon scraps require us to make prepayments in advance of shipment. Accordingly, our advances or prepayments to suppliers increased significantly from RMB 12.6 million, to RMB 123.5 million and to RMB 366.0 million (US$48.8 million) (including amount due from related parties of RMB 4.9 million (US$0.6 million) as of December 31, 2006), as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. As of September 30, 2007, our prepayments to suppliers, including amount due from related parties of RMB 300.8 million (US$40.2 million), increased to RMB 1,529.7 million (US$204.1 million) due primarily to a significant increase in the purchase of polysilicon to meet the increased need of polysilicon as the result of our capacity expansion, and to a lesser extent, the growing demand of a higher percentage of prepayments by the polysilicon suppliers in light of the intensifying competition for the supply of polysilicon.
 
Historically, we required many of our customers to make an advance payment of a certain percentage of their orders, a business practice that helped us to manage our accounts receivable, prepay our suppliers and reduce the amount of funds that we needed to finance our working capital requirements. However, this practice of requiring our customers to make advance payments has diminished, which in turn has increased our need to obtain additional short-term borrowings to fund our current cash requirements. For the nine months period ended September 30, 2007, a small portion of our revenue was derived from sales that required advance payments from our customers. Currently, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from credits sales to our customers, generally with payments due within two to five months. In addition, other customers now pay us through letters of credit, which typically take 30 to 90 days to be processed for us to be paid. As a result, the general decrease in the use of cash advance payments has negatively impacted our short-term liquidity and, coupled with increased sales to a small number of major customers, exposed us to additional and more concentrated credit risk since a significant portion of our outstanding accounts receivable is derived from sales to a limited number of customers. As of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, our top five customers in terms of outstanding accounts receivable accounted for approximately 85.4% and 61.8%, respectively, of our total outstanding accounts receivable. The failure of any of these customers to meet their payment obligations would materially and adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Although we have been able to maintain adequate working capital primarily through short-term borrowing, in the future we may not be able to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us or at all.
 
In addition, in anticipation of sharp rises in the price of polysilicon arising from the industry-wide shortage of polysilicon and increasing market demand for our PV modules, we spent significant working capital to purchase polysilicon in 2005 and 2006 and the first nine months of 2007. As a result, our inventories increased significantly from RMB 17.5 million, to RMB 106.6 million, RMB 811.7 million (US$108.3 million) and RMB 1,059.1 million (US$141.4 million), as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, and September 30, 2007, respectively. We also make prepayments for equipment purchases. Our prepayments for equipment purchases amounted to RMB 18.3 million, RMB 58.6 million and RMB 126.8 million (US$16.9 million) and RMB 60.7 million (US$8.1 million) as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively.

Operating Activities
 
Net cash used in operating activities was RMB 1,975.7 million (US$263.7 million) in the first nine months of 2007, primarily due to a significant increase in prepayments to our polysilicon suppliers, which resulted from a growing need for polysilicon following our capacity expansion and the increased demand by polysilicon suppliers for additional prepayments in light of the continued industry-wide shortage for polysilicon, and a significant increase in accounts receivable and related decrease in cash advances from our customers, which reflected in part the growing percentage of our customers to whom we extend credit or who use letters of credit rather than make advance payments to us, as part of the changing industry practice in light of the increased industry-wide supply of PV modules, and increased sales volume during this period.
 
Net cash used in operating activities was RMB 126.4 million in 2005 and RMB 754.7 million (US$100.7 million) in 2006, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of RMB 17.2 million in 2004. Net cash was used in operating activities in 2006 primarily because payments for inventory, accounts receivable and prepayments to suppliers more than offset an increase in cash advances received from customers and cash received from customers for sales of products.

Net cash was also used in operating activities in 2005 primarily because payments for inventories and prepayments to suppliers more than offset the increase in cash advances received from customers and cash provided by sales of products. Net cash was provided by operating activities in 2004 primarily because cash received from customers for sales of products more than offset payments for inventories and prepayments to suppliers.

Net cash used in investing activities was RMB 512.5 million (US$68.4 million) in the first nine months of 2007, due primarily to continued capacity expansion and advance paid to affiliates, which more than offset the release of restricted cash relating to the Series B preferred shares and mandatory redeemable and convertible bonds.
 
Net cash used in investing activities increased from RMB 29.2 million in 2004 to RMB 227.4 million in 2005 to RMB 605.3 million (US$80.8 million) in 2006, due primarily to continued capacity expansion in our manufacturing facilities in Baoding and the restricted cash placed in escrow for a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the mandatory redeemable bonds payable to Yingli Power, the mandatory convertible bonds payable to Yingli Power and the Series B preferred shares in 2006.
 
Financing Activities
 
Net cash provided by financing activities was RMB 2,695.2 million (US$359.7 million) in the first nine months of 2007, primarily as a result of the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering completed on June 13, 2007 as well as bank borrowings by Tianwei Yingli from financial institutions in China, proceeds from the exercise by China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd. of its warrant into our ordinary shares and the issuance of a portion of the Series B preferred shares in January 2007, which more than offset repayment of borrowings from related parties repayment of short-term bank borrowings and repayment of mandatory redeemable bonds.
 
Net cash provided by financing activities significantly increased from RMB 29.0 million in 2004 to RMB 346.9 million in 2005 primarily as a result of borrowings from financial institutions and related parties. Net cash provided by financing activities further increased to RMB 1,421.3 million (US$189.7 million) in 2006, due primarily to the private placements of the Series A preferred shares, the mandatory redeemable bonds, the mandatory convertible bonds, the Series B preferred shares and borrowings from or guaranteed or entrusted by related parties
 
The net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Series A preferred shares, the Series B preferred shares, the mandatory redeemable bonds payable to Yingli Power and the mandatory convertible bonds payable to Yingli Power were approximately RMB 134.2 million (US$17.9 million), RMB 887.5 million (US$118.5 million), RMB 292.0 million (US$39.0 million) and RMB 361.1 million (US$48.2 million), respectively, or approximately RMB 1,674.8 million (US$223.6 million) in the aggregate. Except for approximately RMB 34.8 million (US$4.6 million) from the issuance and sale of the Series B preferred shares to two investors in January 2007, the proceeds from these private placements were received in 2006. The proceeds from these private placements, except for US$4.5 million (RMB 35.2 million) which was reserved for payment of interest under the mandatory redeemable bonds payable to Yingli Power and the mandatory convertible bonds payable to Yingli Power and RMB 134.6 million (US$18.0 million) which was used by Yingli Green Energy to acquire the 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli from Yingli Group, were, or will be, used to increase the percentage of our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Tianwei Yingli has used the proceeds received from us for the expansion of PV manufacturing facilities, repayment of bank and other third party borrowings, and general corporate purposes. For further description of private placements of the Series A preferred shares, the Series B preferred shares, the mandatory redeemable bonds payable to Yingli Power and the mandatory convertible bonds payable to Yingli Power, see “Restructuring — Private Equity Investments and Other Financings Following the Restructuring”.

We believe that our current cash, bank borrowings and proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, at least until the end of third quarter of 2008. We plan to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for periods beyond the third quarter of 2008 primarily through cash generated from operations, and to the extent required, through borrowings from financial institutions and/or issuances of equity and debt securities. We may, however, require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments. If our existing cash is insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to borrow from financial institutions or our equity interest holders or seek additional equity contributions. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Furthermore, the incurrence of additional debt, including the notes we are offering by this prospectus, could divert cash for working capital and capital expenditures to service debt obligations or result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and Tianwei Yingli’s ability to pay dividends to us, and in turn, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain additional equity contribution or debt financing as required, our business operations and prospects may suffer.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
We had capital expenditures of RMB 28.7 million, RMB 226.5 million, RMB 254.8 million (US$34.0 million) and RMB 799.8 million (US$106.7 million) in 2004, 2005 and 2006 and the first nine months of 2007, respectively. Our capital expenditures were used primarily to build manufacturing facilities for our PV products.
 
We estimate that we will make substantial capital expenditures in 2008 in the amounts of approximately RMB 1,720.0 million, which will be used primarily to build manufacturing facilities for our PV products. We currently plan to increase our annual manufacturing capacity of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to 400 megawatts each by the end of 2008 and to 600 megawatts each by the end of 2009, respectively. As of September 30, 2007, we committed an aggregate of RMB1,223.1 million (US$163.2 million) to purchase property, plant and equipment for such expansion. We plan to fund part of the capital expenditures for the expansion from 400 megawatts to 600 megawatts with proceeds from this offering, which we will inject into Yingli China in the form of an equity contribution, as well as additional borrowings from third parties and from related parties, including banks, and, if any, cash from operations.

For the period from January 1, 2007 to September 30, 2007, we obtained additional short-term borrowings from banks of RMB 2,122.7 million (US$283.3 million) and repaid RMB 1,226.0 million (US$163.6 million). During the same period, we also obtained additional borrowings from related parties and third parties of RMB 63.9 million (US$8.5 million) and RMB 77.0 million (US$10.3 million) and repaid RMB 92.2 million (US$12.3 million) and RMB 89.0 million (US$11.9 million), respectively. Such borrowings were made principally to fund prepayments to polysilicon suppliers and capital expenditure related to our capacity expansion and to repay short-term borrowings.
 
As of September 30, 2007, commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment were approximately RMB 1,223.1 million (US$163.2 million).
 
For the period from October 1, 2007 to October 30, 2007, we obtained additional short-term borrowings from bank of RMB 94.5 million (US$12.6 million) and repaid RMB 86.4 million (US$11.5 million). Such borrowings were made principally to fund prepayments to polysilicon suppliers and capital expenditure related to our capacity expansion and to repay short-term borrowings. During the period, we did not obtain any additional borrowings or repayments from related parties and third parties.
 
As of October 31, 2007, commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment were approximately RMB 1,423.0 million (US$189.9 million).
 
Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements
 
We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our equity interests and classified as owners’ equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing,

liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.
 
Under the joint venture contract, Tianwei Baobian has a right to subscribe for a number of ordinary shares newly issued by us to be determined by a pre-agreed formula set forth in the joint venture contract. See “History and Restructuring — Joint Venture Contract — Subscription Right”.
 
Inflation
 
Since our inception, inflation in China has not materially affected our results of operations. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the change of consumer price index in China was 3.9%, 1.8%, 1.5%, and 4.1% in 2004, 2005, 2006 and in the first nine months of 2007, respectively.
 
Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market Risks
 
Foreign Exchange Risk
 
Most of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, and to a lesser extent, in Renminbi, while a substantial portion of our costs and expenses is denominated in U.S. dollars, Renminbi, Japanese Yen and Euros. Under relevant PRC regulations, we are required to convert the foreign currencies we receive into Renminbi within specified time periods and prior to disbursement.
 
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant effect on our financial stability due to a mismatch among various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly among the U.S. dollar, Euro and Renminbi, affect our net profit margins and would result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from timing differences between the signing of sales contracts or raw material supply contracts and the receipt of payment and the settlement or disbursement relating to these contracts.
 
As of September 30, 2007, we held an equivalent of RMB 1,307.9 million (US$174.6 million) in accounts receivable, of which an equivalent of RMB 782.7 million (US$104.5 million) were denominated in U.S. dollars and RMB 506.1 million (US$67.5 million) were denominated in Euro. As the substantial majority of our sales of our products and purchases of our raw materials are denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro, any significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between Renminbi and the U.S. dollar and/or the Euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Moreover, we had significant monetary assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro as of September 30, 2007, which consisted mainly of accounts receivable and accounts payable. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro. Generally, appreciation of Renminbi against U.S. dollars and Euro will result in foreign exchange losses for monetary assets denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro and foreign exchange gains for monetary liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro. Conversely, depreciation of Renminbi against U.S. dollars and Euro will generally result in foreign exchange gains for monetary assets denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro and foreign exchange losses for monetary liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro.
 
Without taking into account the effect of the potential use of hedging or other derivative financial instruments, we estimate that a 10% appreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar based on the foreign exchange rate on September 28, 2007 would result in our holding Renminbi equivalents of RMB 31.2 million, RMB 235.2 million and RMB 702.8 million (US$93.8 million) for our accounts receivable denominated in U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. These amounts would represent net loss of RMB 6.1 million, RMB 37.1 million and RMB 80.0 million (US$10.7 million) for our accounts receivable denominated in U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Conversely, we estimate that a

129

Table of Contents

10% depreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would result in our holding Renminbi equivalents of RMB 38.1 million, RMB 287.4 million and RMB 858.9 million (US$114.6 million) for our accounts receivable denominated in U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. These amounts would represent net income of RMB 0.8 million, RMB 15.1 million and RMB 76.2 million (US$10.2 million) for our accounts receivable denominated in U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively.
 
Without taking into account the effect of the potential use of hedging or other derivative financial instruments, we estimate that a 10% appreciation of Renminbi against the Euro based on the foreign exchange rate on September 28, 2007 would result in our holding Renminbi equivalents of nil, nil and RMB 456.5 million (US$60.9 million) for our accounts receivable denominated in Euro as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. These amounts would represent net loss of nil, nil and RMB 49.6 million (US$6.6 million) for our accounts receivable denominated in Euro as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Conversely, we estimate that a 10% depreciation of Renminbi against the Euro would result in our holding Renminbi equivalents of nil, nil and RMB 557.9 million (US$74.5 million) for our accounts receivable denominated in Euro as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. These amounts would represent net income of nil, nil and RMB 51.8 million (US$6.9 million) for our accounts receivable denominated in Euro as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively.
 
Yingli Green Energy’s functional currency is U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of Yingli Green Energy are translated into our reporting currency, the Renminbi, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated into our reporting currency, the Renminbi, at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting from the translation of financial statements of Yingli Green Energy are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity.
 
Tianwei Yingli’s functional currency is the Renminbi. Tianwei Yingli translates transactions denominated in other currencies into Renminbi and recognizes any foreign currency exchange gains and losses in our statement of income. Net foreign currency exchange loss was approximately nil in 2004, due to the relatively stable exchange rate between. Net foreign currency exchange loss was RMB 1.8 million in 2005 and RMB 8.1 million (US$1.1 million) in 2006 due to the adjustment of the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Renminbi, beginning in July 2005 when the PRC government began to allow the Renminbi to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of foreign currencies. Net foreign currency exchange loss was RMB 3.5 million (US$0.5 million) in the first nine months of 2007 primarily due to continued appreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by sales denominated in Euro during this period as the Euro appreciated against Renminbi. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency exchange losses in the future. Although we plan to reduce the effect of such exposure through hedging arrangements, such as entering into forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts, due to the limited availability of hedging instruments in China, we cannot assure you that we will find a suitable hedging arrangement, or that such hedging activities will be effective in managing our foreign exchange risk exposure.
 
The value of your investment in our ADSs will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Renminbi. To the extent we hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars, including the net proceeds to us from this offering, any appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar could result in a foreign currency exchange loss recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income and a reduction in the value of our U.S. dollar denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar could reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results, the dividends Tianwei Yingli may pay us in the future, if

130

Table of Contents

any, the dividends we may pay to you in the future, if any, and the value of your investment in us, all of which may have a material adverse effect on the prices of our ADSs and the value of the notes.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to our interest expenses incurred by our short-term borrowings and interest income generated by excess cash invested in demand deposits. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. However, our future interest expense may increase due to changes in market interest rates.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 establishes the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax-return positions in the consolidated financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority, and prescribes a measurement methodology for those positions meeting the recognition threshold. FIN 48 is effective and applicable to us on and after January 1, 2007. The initial adoption of FIN 48 did not have any effect on our financial position or result of operations.
 
In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments — An amendment of FASB Statements 133 and 140, or SFAS No. 155. SFAS No. 155 improves financial reporting by eliminating the exemption from applying SFAS No. 133 to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of the form of the instruments. SFAS No. 155 also improves financial reporting by allowing a preparer to elect fair value measurement at acquisition, at issuance, or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a re-measurement event, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, in cases in which a derivative would otherwise have to be bifurcated, if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 is effective and applicable to us for all financial instruments acquired or issued after January 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement, or SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 addresses standardizing the measurement of fair value for companies that are required to use a fair value measure of recognition for recognition or disclosure purposes. The FASB defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measure date”. SFAS No. 157 is effective and applicable to us on and after January 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for us on January 1, 2008, although earlier adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating whether to elect the fair value option, as permitted under SFAS 159.

BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
We are one of the leading vertically integrated photovoltaic, or PV, product manufacturers in China. We design, manufacture and sell PV modules, and design, assemble, sell and install PV systems that are connected to an electricity transmission grid or those that operate on a stand-alone basis. With an annual production capacity of 200 megawatts for each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules as of the date of this prospectus, we believe we are currently one of the largest manufacturers of PV products in China as measured by annual production capacity. Except for the production of polysilicon materials that are used to manufacture polysilicon ingots and wafers, our products and services substantially cover the entire PV industry value chain from the manufacture of multicrystalline polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to PV systems and PV system installation. We believe we are one of the few large-scale PV companies in China to have adopted a vertically integrated business model. Our end-products include PV modules and PV systems in different sizes and power outputs. We sell PV modules under our own brand name, Yingli, to PV system integrators and distributors located in various markets around the world, including Germany, Spain, China, Italy and the United States.
 
In 2002, we began producing PV modules with an initial annual production capacity of three megawatts and have significantly expanded production capacities of our PV products in the past five years to the current level. In April 2006, we launched a new expansion project in Baoding, China to increase our annual production capacity of our PV products. We currently plan to gradually expand annual production capacity of each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to 400 megawatts by the end of 2008 and to 600 megawatts by the end of 2009.
 
Historically, we have sold and installed PV systems in the western regions of China where substantial government-subsidized, rural electrification projects are underway. We also sell PV systems to mobile communications service providers in China for use across China and plan to export our PV systems into major international markets such as Germany, Spain, Italy and the United States. In order to promote the export of our PV systems, we have participated in the design and installation of large PV system projects undertaken by our customers overseas. For example, we cooperated with Solar-Energiedach GmbH NL in the design and installation of a one-megawatt PV system covering the roof of the Kaiserslautern soccer stadium in Germany, one of the FIFA World Cup 2006 venues. We have been cooperating with Acciona Energia S.A. in connection with a large PV system installation project to be installed in Moura, Portugal, for which we will provide PV modules. Historically, sales of PV systems by us have not been significant. However, we expect our sales of PV systems to increase although we expect such sales to remain relatively insignificant as a percentage of our net revenues in the near term.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively and to capitalize on the rapid growth of the global PV market.
 
Vertically Integrated Business Model
 
In 2003, we developed the ability to manufacture multicrystalline polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells, PV modules and integrated PV systems. Our products and services currently comprise substantially the entire PV industry value chain except for the manufacture of polysilicon feedstock, and we believe we are one of the few PV companies in China who have adopted such a highly integrated business model. We believe that our vertically integrated business model enables us to capture profit at nearly every stage of the PV industry value chain and withstand, or capitalize on, the fluctuating profit margins of products at different stages of the PV industry value chain. While the profit margins for different products in the PV industry value chain may vary and change over time,

132

Table of Contents

we believe we would be well positioned to maintain or improve our overall profit margin relative to many of our competitors that produce only a limited range of PV products.
 
We believe that our vertically integrated business model enables us to closely monitor the quality of our PV products and design and streamline our manufacturing process to more efficiently leverage technical and cost improvements across various stages of our manufacturing process. We believe that our vertically integrated business model has been instrumental to increasing the yield from our production process, improving the conversion efficiency of our PV cells and cutting the lead time in filling orders from our customers.
 
High-Quality Products and Growing Brand Recognition
 
We sell PV modules under our own brand name, Yingli, to PV system integrators and distributors worldwide. We plan to further build up our brand name by supplying consistently high quality products to our customers. The majority of our PV modules have passed the tests administered by the Arizona State University Photovoltaic Testing Laboratory under the IEC 61215 test standards, have received TÜV certificates in Germany, and have been authorized by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. of the United States to use the “UL” certification. We believe these international certifications and test standards foster customer confidence in our products and signify the quality and reliability of our products. We also actively participate in trade shows and exhibitions worldwide to promote our brand name and products. As a result of these efforts, we believe our brand name is achieving a significant level of recognition in our major overseas markets. Several articles about us have also appeared on the website of Solarbuzz, an independent solar energy research and consulting firm.
 
In order to promote the export of our PV systems, we have participated in the design and installation of large PV system projects undertaken by our customers overseas. For example, we collaborated with Solar-Energiedach GmbH NL in the design and installation of a one-megawatt PV system covering the roof of the Kaiserslautern soccer stadium in Germany, one of the FIFA World Cup 2006 venues.
 
In China, we were designated by the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission in 1999 to develop production capacity for multicrystalline PV cells and systems. Since then, we have been a leader in the research, development and refinement of production processes for multicrystalline PV products in China. In addition, we have actively promoted our brand name through advertisements on newspapers and trade magazines in China.
 
Established Customer and Supplier Relationships
 
By supplying high-quality PV modules, we have established solid business relationships with a number of leading system integrators and installers in major international markets, including Germany, Spain and the United States, despite the fact that such business relationships have been developed in a short period of time. For example, we entered into long-term sales arrangements with our major international customers, including an arrangement with Acciona Energía, S.A., one of our key customers in Spain. Under the contract with Acciona Energía, we are required to supply an aggregate of 42 megawatts PV modules until 2008. The term of this contract may be extended for one year by mutual agreement. In May 2007, we entered into a contract with Laxtron Energías Renovables for the supply of an aggregate of 12 megawatts PV modules through the end of 2007.
 
In China, we have built strategic relationships with leading Chinese telecommunications vendors, which have enabled us to sell to such vendors large, stand-alone integrated PV systems used to provide power to wireless telecommunications towers and base stations. In addition, we have a strong customer base in the southwestern regions of China, including Sichuan and Tibet. Chengdu Yingli and Tibetan Yingli sell and install PV systems in their respective local markets. Our presence in Sichuan and Tibet has enabled us to establish a strong customer base in these regions and maintain

133

Table of Contents

cooperative relationships with the local governments, both of which have helped us to obtain new business opportunities in Sichuan, Tibet and their surrounding regions.
 
We have maintained close relationships with some of the world’s major polysilicon suppliers by entering into long-term supply contracts. With a view to obtaining larger amounts of long-term supplies of polysilicon on more favorable terms to satisfy our future needs, which is expected to increase as the result of our production capacity expansion plans for 2008 and 2009, we are actively seeking to further strengthen our relationship with our polysilicon suppliers and establish strategic relationships with them. We are also in active discussions with several other polysilicon suppliers overseas to secure supply of polysilicon on a long-term basis, which generally provide for the supply of polysilicon or solar grade silicon feedstock materials at a substantially lower unit price than that obtainable in the spot market or under short-term contracts with a term of one year or less. We have concluded, and are in the process of negotiating, new polysilicon supply contracts with our major polysilicon suppliers. For example, in August 2006, November 2006, July 2007 and September 2007, we entered into four long-term supply contracts with Wacker Chemie AG, or Wacker, a German polysilicon supplier, for supplies of polysilicon from 2009 through 2013, from 2009 through 2017, from 2010 through 2018 and from 2009 through 2011, respectively. These contracts have terms of 7 years, 11 years, 11 years and 4 years, respectively, and the prices at which polysilicon is supplied under these contracts are subject to adjustment according to the relevant energy price index. We also have contracts with Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Science and Technology Co., Ltd. of China, or Xinguang, a PRC silicon manufacturer, for the supply of polysilicon for 2007 and 2008. Pursuant to the contracts, Xinguang has agreed to supply 1,232 tons of polysilicon to us in 2007 and 2008. As of the date of this prospectus, 50 tons have already been delivered, 182 tons have been committed to be delivered before the end of the first quarter of 2008 with the remaining 1,000 tons to be delivered by the end of 2008. We also entered into a contract with Komex Inc., or Komex, in April 2007, under which Komex will supply 360 tons of silicon materials to us from April 2007 to March 2008. As of the date of this prospectus, we have secured all of our estimated polysilicon needs for 2007 mainly through the supply contracts with Xinguang and Komex and inventory carryover and approximately 60% of our currently expected polysilicon needs for 2008 through supply contracts with Xinguang and other suppliers, as determined on the basis of our current capacity expansion plans. However, long-term polysilicon supply contracts with delivery terms of one year or more, which consist of our contracts with Wacker and Xinguang as of the date of this prospectus, will satisfy only a small portion of our long-term polysilicon requirements, as currently estimated based on our capacity expansion plans.
 
Cost-Effective and Efficient Manufacturing Process
 
The technical improvements resulting from our research and development efforts have been instrumental in significantly reducing our production costs and increasing our operational efficiency. For example, our ability to reduce the thickness of our wafers from 325 microns in 2003 to 200 microns in December 2006 has enabled us to produce a greater number of wafers per unit of polysilicon used and reduce our per unit production cost. In addition, improvements in our techniques for mixing different grades of polysilicon feedstock have enabled us to use a greater percentage of cheaper polysilicon scraps, such as the discarded tops and tails of ingots, pot scraps and broken wafers, with a minimal reduction in the quality of our PV modules, which has enabled us to reduce our per unit material cost. Furthermore, the increase in the average conversion efficiency of our PV cells, which resulted from improving the absorption qualities of our PV cells, has enabled us to generate greater sales revenue from the same amount of polysilicon used as our PV modules, which are made up of PV cells, are sold on a per watt basis.
 
We believe that a balanced combination of advanced automated manufacturing equipment and low-cost skilled labor in China also enables us to improve operational efficiency and reduce our cost more efficiently than our overseas competitors. For example, our newly acquired ingot-casting furnaces, ingot block-cutting bricketers and wafer-slicing wire saws use some of the more advanced process technologies, which has been instrumental in efficiently utilizing our resources. The relatively

low cost of skilled labor in China also benefits us with respect to the labor-intensive aspects of our manufacturing processes such as sorting through polysilicon feedstock to gather feedstock suitable for production. We believe that our technology and our labor cost advantages provide us with substantial competitive advantages over our overseas competitors.
 
Steadily Improving Research and Development Capability
 
Our research and development team was formed in 1998 and is one of the pioneers in the research and development of multicrystalline-based PV products in China. We have built a large team of experienced and talented engineers and technicians with proven research skills and the capability to solve practical problems encountered in our manufacturing process. Our engineers and technicians actively involve in our manufacturing process to solve problems on-site and continuously strive to find solutions to improve our manufacturing process. The key focus areas for our research and development activities include (i) reducing production costs, (ii) improving the quality and conversion efficiency of PV cells and PV modules and (iii) improving operational efficiency through seamless integration of the overall manufacturing process. As the result of our steadily improving research and development capacity, we began producing 240 kilogram multicrystalline polysilicon ingots in 2003 and 260 kilograms multicrystalline polysilicon ingots in 2005. In December 2006, we started producing wafers with a thickness of 200 microns.
 
Experienced Management Team
 
Our management team has substantial expertise in our operations and increased our manufacturing capacity, revenues and profits. Mr. Liansheng Miao, our chairperson and chief executive officer and Tianwei Yingli’s vice chairperson and chief executive officer, has 20 years of senior management experience in the PV and other manufacturing businesses. Mr. Miao was featured on the front cover of Photon International , a leading trade journal on the subject of the international PV industry, in August 2005 and currently serves as an executive director of the Photovoltaic Committee of the China Renewable Energies Association. Mr. Guoxiao Yao, chief technology officer of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli, has a doctorate degree in PV engineering. Mr. Seok Jin Lee, chief operating officer of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli, has six years of senior management experience at Hyundai Heavy Industries, a South Korean heavy machinery manufacturer, including its solar business division. Mr. Zongwei Li, chief financial officer of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli, has 11 years of experience in providing auditing services to large Chinese and international enterprises in the energy, high technology, manufacturing and other industries. Dr. Nabih Cherradi, a vice president of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli, was a process manager for ten years at HCT Shaping Systems SA (currently, Applied Materials Switzerland SA), a Swiss manufacturer of wire sawing machine used in the semiconductor and PV wafer industry, which is also one of our major production equipment suppliers and a senior scientist for six years at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne. Mr. Xiangdong Wang, a director and vice president of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli, has over 7 years of experience in the accounting field. Mr. Zhiheng Zhao, a vice president of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli, has over 20 years of experience in electricity transformer manufacturing, having served in various managerial capacities with different electricity transformer manufacturers including Tianwei Baobian, a manufacturer of large electricity transformers and the holder of the minority interest in Tianwei Yingli. Mr. Stuart Brannigan, whom we appointed as the managing director of Europe in October, 2007, brings with him over 17 years of experience in the renewable energy and PV industry and will help us further enhance our European strategy, strengthen our European service team and enhance our market position in the region. As a result, our management team has developed a deep understanding of the major aspects of procurement, marketing and production of PV products in China.

Our Strategies
 
We seek to maintain our leadership position in the development and manufacture of PV products by taking advantage of our high degree of vertical integration in the PV production process which yields economies of scale and cost savings. More specifically, we plan to focus on the following areas:
 
Expand Global Reach for Our Products
 
Our current key international markets are Germany and Spain, which represented our two largest markets based on the revenues from the sales of our PV modules and PV systems in 2006 and in the first nine months of 2007. We seek to increase sales in the United States and Spain and expand into selected countries in southern Europe, where we believe the PV market is likely to grow significantly in the near term. For example, in November 2006, we entered into a contract with Acciona Energía, S.A. for the supply of an aggregate of 42 megawatt PV modules until 2008. In May 2007, we entered into a contract with Laxtron Energías Renovables for the supply of an aggregate of 12 megawatts PV modules through the end of 2007. We also entered into module sale contracts with Control y Montages Industriales CYMI S.A., or CYMI, and with Aplicaciones Técuicas de La Energia S.L., or ATERSA, both Spanish companies, in June 2007 and October 2007, respectively, for the supply of an aggregate of more than 20 megawatt PV modules by the end of 2007. We believe the visibility of our brand name in Germany and Spain will help us expand into our new targeted markets in Europe. We also seek to strengthen our relationships with existing customers by entering into long-term sales contracts with them. We also plan to set up subsidiaries in Europe and the United States to provide services to our customers in those markets.
 
Expand PV Systems Sales to Overseas Markets
 
We currently see a significant market potential in the design, development, installation and operation of PV systems in overseas markets. We believe that expansion of our sales and installation of PV systems into overseas markets will improve our profit margins and also add value to our brand name and create stable demand for our PV modules. Accordingly, while we plan to continue to strengthen our manufacturing capacity, we also plan to significantly expand the sale of PV systems by taking the following steps:
 
 	• 	fostering and improving our existing relationships with established PV system integrators and installers in Europe by continuing to participate in their large system integration and installation projects and supplying PV modules to these customers at competitive prices in exchange for the right to participate in their system integration projects; and
 
 	• 	building up our capabilities to undertake PV system projects in collaboration with PV system integrators and installers in Europe and the United States.
 
We believe that our strong manufacturing capacity for upstream PV products, such as PV cells and PV modules, provides significant advantages to compete in the downstream market of PV system sales and installations. Our expansion in the PV system market will focus on large-scale, on-grid PV systems.
 
Increase Production Capacity
 
In April 2006, we launched a new expansion project in Baoding, China to increase our annual production capacity of each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to 600 megawatts by the end of 2009. By the end of July 2007, we achieved 200 megawatts of annual capacity and expect to achieve another 200 megawatts by the end of 2008, with the remaining 200 megawatts of annual capacity to be achieved by the end of 2009. We will closely continue to monitor the progress of this expansion project to avoid risks of over-expansion while evaluating other available expansion opportunities. We believe expansion of our production capacity is likely to result in greater economies of scale for our operations.

Table of Contents

Secure and Strengthen Stable and Long-Term Relationships with Polysilicon Suppliers
 
Stable and reliable polysilicon supplies are critical to our long-term growth and profitability. Since 2003, when we began to purchase polysilicon for use in our PV products, we have met our polysilicon needs primarily through three-month to one-year supply contracts with suppliers and distributors overseas and in China. We seek to strengthen and expand these relationships by entering into more long-term and stable contractual relationships. Long-term supply contracts generally provide for the supply of polysilicon at a substantially lower unit price than that obtainable in the spot market or under short-term contracts with a term of one year or less. Therefore, we plan to secure a portion of our polysilicon requirements from several overseas and domestic polysilicon suppliers.
 
Achieve Technological Advances Through Dedicated and Continuous Research and Development Efforts
 
We plan to continue to dedicate an increasing amount of resources and efforts to research and development. The primary focus of our research and development efforts is on improving our manufacturing processes in order to raise the yield rate and deliver higher-efficiency and more diversified PV products at a lower cost. We believe these research and development efforts will help enhance the quality of our products, which we believe will in turn significantly enhance our profitability. More specifically, the key elements of our research and development efforts include:
 
 	• 	Adopt Acid Texturation Technology for Multicrystalline PV Cells.  We have adopted new equipment for our multicrystalline silicon PV cell production lines. These new equipment are able to isotropically create a textural effect on multicrystalline silicon PV cells to trap more light coming into multicrystalline PV cells and to reduce the reflection loss of this type of PV cells, hence substantially improving their short-circuit current.
 
 	• 	Optimize Phosphorous Doping Profile and Front-Sided Contact Designs of Multicrystalline Silicon PV Cells.  We intend to optimize emitter doping profiles and emitter uniformity of our multicrystalline silicon PV cells, which we believe will significantly improve the spectral response to short wave length lights and efficiency consistency of our PV cells. In addition, we are seeking to improve the front contact designs of our multicrystalline silicon PV cells, which allow a reduction of the shading and resistance losses of the cells.
 
 	• 	Produce Larger Ingots and Thinner Wafers at Lower Cost.  We intend to continue to explore ways to cast larger ingots and slice thinner wafers through cooperation with the furnace supplier to produce larger ingots.
 
 	• 	Improve PV System Technology.  In line with our strategy to expand our downstream PV system sales and installation, we seek to continuously improve our PV system technology. We plan to accumulate experience in implementing large on-grid PV system projects through cooperation with overseas PV system integrators and installers. We also plan to improve the technology for home-use PV systems to facilitate the use of our PV modules as replacement for tiles or other roof-covering materials.
 
 	• 	Optimize Polysilicon Feedstock Mix.  We plan to continue to optimize the silicon feedstock mixture used in the polysilicon ingot casting process and the methods by which they are prepared and mixed in order to reduce the use of expensive high-purity polysilicon with minimal effect on the quality of our polysilicon wafers or the conversion efficiency of our PV cells.
 
 	• 	Establish Dedicated Research Institutions.  We plan to establish a PV research and development center to support our expansion into the downstream PV system integration market. In addition, we plan to establish a training facility to further enhance the knowledge base of our research and development staff and strengthen our research and development and engineering resources.

Expand Market Share in China
 
Although the PV market in China is currently smaller than other major PV markets, such as Germany and Spain, we believe that the adoption of a series of new laws, regulations and initiatives by the Chinese government, including China’s Renewable Energy Law, the Supervision Regulations on the Purchase of All Renewable Energy by Power Grid Enterprises, the National Medium- and Long-Term Programs for Renewable Energy and the recent amendments to the PRC Energy-Saving Law demonstrates the PRC government’s commitment to develop renewable energy sources and may lead to rapid growth in the PV market in China. See “— Industry — Key Growth Drivers of the Solar Energy Industry — Government Incentives — China”.
 
Based on market information available to us, we believe that we are currently one of the leaders in the Chinese PV market in terms of annual production capacity and degree of vertical integration, and we plan to take the following actions to further enhance our market position in China:
 
 	• 	strengthen our existing relationship with the PRC government and major Chinese telecommunications companies and equipment vendors, see “— Markets and Customers”;
 
 	• 	pursue new business opportunities in China, such as selling more independent PV systems to local residential users (as currently being pursued by Tibetan Yingli) and installing services for fire-prevention, telecommunication and weather forecasting stations (as currently being pursued by our subsidiary in Chengdu);
 
 	• 	promote the awareness of PV products in general and our brand name in particular by installing demonstration PV systems in public areas and through donation of PV systems; and
 
 	• 	leverage the experience and expertise obtained in overseas markets to develop a technological edge over our competitors in China as well as build up a greater visibility for our brand name and products in China.
 
Industry
 
Introduction
 
Solar power systems are used for a variety of residential, commercial and industrial applications generally categorized as either “on-grid” or “off-grid”. “Off-grid” applications represent PV systems that operate on a stand-alone basis to provide electricity independent of an electricity transmission grid. “On-grid” applications represent PV systems that are connected to an electricity transmission grid and feeds electricity generated into the electricity transmission grid. The market for “on-grid” applications, where solar power is used to supplement electricity purchased from a public utility network, represents the largest and fastest growing segment of the market. The “Balanced Energy” forecast scenario prepared by Solarbuzz, a solar energy research and consulting firm, forecasted worldwide installations of PV systems to increase from 1,744 megawatts in 2006 to 4,177 megawatts in 2011. “Off-grid” markets offer opportunities to access solar energy where access to public utility networks is not physically or economically feasible. “Off-grid” markets include consumer applications such as portable recreation power modules and garden lighting, industrial applications, such as road signs, highway call boxes and support systems for communications systems, and rural residential applications.
 
Advantages of Solar Energy
 
Solar energy has several advantages over conventional energy and other forms of renewable energy, and these advantages have been increasingly recognized over time:
 
 	• 	Environmental Friendliness and Renewability.  Solar power is one of the most environmentally friendly and cleanest sources of electricity without air or water emissions, noise, vibrations or any waste generation.

138

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	Peak Energy Generation Ability.  Solar power is well-suited to match peak energy needs as maximum sunlight hours generally correspond to peak demand periods when electricity prices are at their highest.
 
 	• 	Easily Located with End Users.  Unlike other renewable resources such as hydroelectric and wind power, solar power can be utilized anywhere that receives sunlight and directly at the site where the power will be used. As a result, solar power avoids the expense of, and energy losses associated with, transmission and distribution of electricity from large-scale electrical plants to end users.
 
 	• 	No Fluctuations in Operating Costs.  Unlike fossil and nuclear fuels, solar energy has no fuel price volatility. Although there is variability in the amount and timing of sunlight over the day, season and year, a properly sized and configured system can be designed for high reliability while supplying electricity on a long-term, fixed-cost basis.
 
 	• 	Reliability and Durability.  Without moving parts or the need for periodic maintenance, solar power systems are among the most reliable forms of electricity generation. Accelerated aging tests have shown that solar modules can operate for at least 25 to 30 years without requiring major maintenance.
 
 	• 	Modularity.  PV systems are easily modularized and scalable, and therefore can be deployed in many different sizes and configurations to meet the specific needs of the user. PV modules are increasingly used to serve as both a power generator and the exterior of a building. Like architectural glass, PV modules can be installed on the roofs and facades of residential and commercial buildings.
 
The Global Market for Solar Energy
 
The global PV market, as measured by annual solar power system installations at end-user locations, increased from 345 megawatts in 2001 to 1,744 megawatts in 2006, according to Solarbuzz. The Solarbuzz “Balanced Energy” forecast scenario forecasted global PV industry revenues and PV system installations to be US$18.6 billion and 4,177 megawatts, respectively, in 2011.
 
Germany, Japan and the United States were the three largest single-country markets for PV industry installations in 2006. The following table sets forth the annual PV installations in key markets for the periods indicated.

Key Growth Drivers of the Solar Energy Industry
 
We believe the following factors have driven and will continue to drive the growth of the solar energy industry.

139

Table of Contents

Government Incentives
 
The rapid growth of the PV industry in Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and the United States is primarily attributable to government incentives in these countries. Other countries, including China, are increasingly adopting similar incentives. Typical government incentives include capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits and net metering. Capital cost rebates give government subsidies to persons who install a solar power system based on the size of such system. Feed-in tariffs involve requiring electricity utilities to make a payment to users for solar power that such users generate and provide to the grid based on kilowatt-hours produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Net metering allows a user to offset its electricity contributions to the public grid against the fees it pays for electricity used.
 
Germany.  Germany’s Renewable Energy Law of 2000 requires public power grid operators to connect various renewable energy sources to their electricity transmission grids and to purchase all electricity generated by such sources at guaranteed feed-in tariffs. Germany also provides capital expenditure subsidies, low-interest loans and tax relief to renewable energy generators and capital cost subsidies, low-interest loans and tax relief to end-users of renewable energy.
 
Spain.  The Spanish Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving provided € 189.6 million to finance PV projects in 2004. In August 2005, Spain, the second-largest solar energy market in Europe, adopted The New Renewable Energy Plan to install up to 400 megawatts of installed generation capacity from solar photovoltaic by the end of 2010. Under the plan, the actual feed-in tariffs for solar energy in Spain are fully guaranteed for 25 years and 80% guaranteed thereafter. On October 1, 2007, Joan Clos, the Spanish Minister for Industry, Tourism and Commerce, stated that the government intends to increase its target for solar PV installations in Spain to 1,200 MW by 2010, from the previous target of 400 MW by 2010.
 
Japan.  Japan’s Residential PV System Dissemination Program (RPVDP), which was launched by the Japanese government in 1994 and ran through October 2005, contributed to Japan’s emergence as one of the leading PV markets in the world in terms of total installed PV capacity. The RPVDP subsidized PV systems for residential buildings and was responsible for PV installations at over 200,000 residential units in Japan. Japan is currently planning a subsidy program for 30 kilowatt to 50 kilowatt PV systems mounted on public buildings, schools, factories and office premises. Japan’s current target is to use renewable energy sources to meet up to 10% of its energy requirements by 2030, with approximately half (approximately 100 gigawatts) coming from PV energy sources.
 
United States.  A number of states in the United States have committed substantial resources to developing and implementing renewable energy programs. California, the largest PV market within the United States representing approximately 60 megawatts out of the total 90 megawatts installed in the United States in 2004, has adopted the California New Solar Homes Partnership Program, under which a purchaser of solar energy products becomes entitled to a cash rebate from the California Energy Commission, a state tax credit and net metering benefits. In addition, Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania require electricity suppliers to obtain a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable resources and have set specific targets for procurement of solar products.
 
China.  China’s Renewable Energy Law, enacted in February 2005, authorizes the government to set favorable prices for surplus on-grid PV-generated electricity through feed-in tariffs. This law also requires the establishment of a renewable energy development fund for research and development and creates other financial incentives for renewable energy projects. The PRC government is planning to increase its PV installations to 450 megawatts by 2010 and to 900 megawatts by 2020.
 
In July 2007, the PRC State Electricity Regulatory Commission issued the Supervision Regulations on the Purchase of All Renewable Energy by Power Grid Enterprises which became effective on September 1, 2007. To promote the use of renewable energy for power generation, the regulations require that electricity grid enterprises must set up connections between the grids and

140

Table of Contents

renewable power generation systems and purchase all the electricity generated by renewable power generation systems in a timely manner. The regulations also provide that power dispatch institutions shall give priority to renewable power generation companies providing power dispatch services.
 
On September 4, the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, implemented the National Medium- and Long-Term Programs for Renewable Energy, or MLPRE, aiming to raise consumption of electricity from renewable sources to 10% and 15% of total electricity consumption by 2010 and 2020, up from 7.5% in 2005, which highlights the government’s long-term commitment to the development of renewable energy.
 
On October 28, 2007, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted amendments to the PRC Energy-Saving Law, which set forth policies to encourage energy-saving in manufacturing, civic buildings, transportation, government agents and utilities sectors. The amendments also seek to expand the use of solar energy in construction areas.
 
Other Countries.  Other countries also have adopted initiatives to encourage the development of solar energy. For example, in August 2005, Italy introduced a feed-in law for renewable energy sources. In February 2007, the government amended the renewable energy law and introduced a new version of the feed-in tariffs. The incentive remuneration is valid for a period of 20 years.
 
Advances in Technologies Making Solar Power More Cost-Efficient
 
Recent technological advances have introduced more cost-effective ways to use solar power in off-grid products. For example, the power output of light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, has increased significantly in recent years while the voltage required to charge and the cost to produce LEDs have significantly decreased. As a result, a cost-effective combination of low-voltage LEDs and rechargeable solar-powered battery systems has led to a series of new product applications, including solar energy lighting products such as LED roadway, railway, marine, transit, aviation and other outdoor lighting, solar-powered bus stop signs and solar-powered oil and gas monitoring equipment. Consumer solar power applications also have expanded beyond simple solar-powered calculators, radios, watches and toys to more sophisticated products such as mobile phones and laptops.
 
Rising Energy Demand and Increasing Costs of Finite Fossil Energy Resources
 
Worldwide economic development and population growth continue to fuel energy demand. Worldwide demand for electricity is expected to nearly double from 14.3 billion megawatt hours in 2002 to 26.0 billion megawatt hours in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. According to Commodity Systems Inc., a world financial and commodity market data provider, the Brent crude oil price has increased from US$22.97 per barrel as of January 2, 2001 to US$88.38 per barrel as of November 19, 2007. Future demand for energy is likely to be met increasingly by renewable energy sources such as solar energy.
 
Increasing Environmental Concerns Over Conventional Energy
 
Increasing environmental concerns over the effect of burning fossil fuels have led to the implementation of greenhouse gas reduction strategies by many countries through international treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol and national or regional regulations to reduce air pollution. A significant number of countries, including the United States, Australia, China and certain members of the European Union, have adopted and are expected to continue government initiatives to encourage the development of solar power and other renewable energy sources in order to address these environmental concerns.
 
Narrowing Cost Differentials between Solar and Conventional Energy Sources
 
Solar energy has become an attractive alternative energy source because of its decreasing manufacturing costs and reduced sales prices over time. According to the Solarbuzz “Balanced

141

Table of Contents

Energy” forecast scenario, the average price of PV modules is expected to decrease from US$3.72 per watt in 2006 to US$2.58 per watt in 2011.
 
Key Challenges for the Solar Energy Industry
 
Continuing Reliance on Governmental Support and Incentives.  At present, most renewable energy sources would not be cost-competitive compared to traditional energy sources without government support, and the PV industry relies on governmental incentives to encourage production and consumption, especially for on-grid systems. Changes in government policies could lead to a reduction in incentives and subsidies to the renewable energy sector, which could in turn seriously hinder the growth of the PV industry.
 
Increasing Cost-Competitiveness.  Although the costs of generating electricity through photovoltaic means have fallen significantly in recent years, solar power generation is still expensive compared to conventional power generation. The primary challenge to the PV industry is to reduce the price per watt of energy for the end-user. The cost per watt of PV systems can be reduced by, among others, lowering polysilicon cost, reducing silicon usage per watt, increasing the conversion efficiency of PV cells and improving manufacturing processes.
 
Raw Materials Supply Shortage.  At present, there is industry-wide shortage of polysilicon, which has increased the price of polysilicon. Although quartz sand, which is used to make polysilicon, is in ample supply, silicon extraction capacity is limited, and PV wafer makers compete with the semiconductor industry for polysilicon supply. Due to shortage of supply in the industry, the price of polysilicon has been increasing and may continue to increase in the foreseable future. We believe that the availability of polysilicon is the key issue affecting the growth prospects for the PV industry in the short to medium term.
 
Aesthetic Concern.  We believe that aesthetics are a barrier to the wider adoption of PV products among commercial and residential users. Established PV products tend to be heavy, rigid and fragile. PV producers can improve aesthetics by developing products that are lighter, more flexible and more modular and can be more easily and attractively integrated into building structures.
 
The PV Industry Value Chain
 
The PV industry value chain begins with the melting of metallurgical-grade silicon, purifying it and casting it into ingots. The ingots are cut into blocks and then sliced into wafers that are chemically processed to make PV cells which generate electric current when exposed to sunlight. Interconnected PV cells are packaged into modules, which protect PV cells and collect the electricity generated. PV systems are comprised of multiple modules and related electronics to harness and store the electricity generated.
 
The following diagram illustrates the different stages of the PV industry value chain.

Our Products and Services
 
Our products and services include the manufacture of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells, PV modules and integrated PV systems, which encompass substantially the entire PV industry value chain, with the manufacture of polysilicon feedstock being the only significant exception.
 
Polysilicon Ingots and Blocks
 
A polysilicon ingot is formed by melting, purifying and solidifying polysilicon feedstock into a brick-shaped ingot. Most of our ingots weigh up to 260 kilograms and reach the size of 690 millimeters x 690 millimeters x 240 millimeters. The polysilicon ingots are then cut into blocks. Our polysilicon blocks are generally available in two different sizes: 125 millimeters x 125 millimeters x 240 millimeters and 156 millimeters x 156 millimeters x 240 millimeters. We use our polysilicon blocks to produce polysilicon wafers.
 
Polysilicon Wafers
 
The polysilicon blocks are then sliced into wafers with wire saws. Thinner wafers enable a more efficient use of polysilicon, and thus lower the cost per watt of power produced. The thickness of our wafers decreased from 325 microns in 2003 to 200 microns in December 2006. Our wafers are generally available in two sizes: 125 millimeters x 125 millimeters and 156 millimeters x 156 millimeters. At times when we had produced an excess amount of wafers as a result of the disparity in our wafer production capacity and the PV cell capacity, we provided the excess wafers to third-party toll manufacturers which processed wafers into PV cells and return the PV cells to us for a processing fee under toll manufacturing arrangements. We sent approximately 75.0%, 40.8% and 8.2% of our polysilicon wafer output to third-party toll manufacturers for processing into PV cells in 2005, 2006 and the first nine months of 2007, respectively. Toll manufacturing is a type of contract manufacturing frequently used in the PV industry, under which part of the manufacturing process is outsourced to qualified third parties, or toll manufacturers. The raw materials used by toll manufacturers are usually supplied by the outsourcing company in order to control output quality. As we have achieved the same level of manufacturing capacity for polysilicon wafers and PV cells, we have terminated a majority of our toll manufacturing arrangements with third-party toll manufacturers. Our successful completion in July 2007 of the first stage of our Phase III 500MW manufacturing expansion plan, which added another 100MW of total production capacity of polysilicon wafers, PV cells and PV modules and doubled our total production capacity to 200MW, further strengthened our vertically integrated business model. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, we sent only approximately 8.2% of our polysilicon wafer output to third-party toll manufacturing manufacturers for processing into PV cells.
 
PV Cells
 
A PV cell is a device made from a polysilicon wafer that converts sunlight into electricity by a process known as the photovoltaic effect. The conversion efficiency of a PV cell is the ratio of electrical energy produced by the cell to the energy from sunlight that reaches the cell. The conversion efficiency of PV cells is determined to a large extent by the quality of wafers used to produce the PV cells, which is, in turn, determined by the mix of different types of polysilicon raw materials used in the ingot casting process. As a substantially vertically integrated PV product manufacturer, we have sought to optimize the ratio of expensive high-purity polysilicon to cheaper polysilicon scraps used in our feedstock mix so as to minimize production cost while maintaining the average conversion efficiency for our multicrystalline PV cells at 15.3%, which we believe is within the range of industry standard and which we were able to attain in August 2007.
 
We generally use all of our PV cells in the production of our PV modules.

PV Modules
 
A PV module is an assembly of PV cells that are electrically interconnected, laminated and framed in a durable and weatherproof package. Most of our PV modules are made with PV cells produced by us or by third-party PV cell manufacturers under toll manufacturing arrangements using polysilicon wafers produced by us. The raw materials used by toll manufacturers are usually supplied by the outsourcing company in order to control output quality. A small portion of our PV modules is made with PV cells provided by third-party suppliers. Our PV modules are made with a frame design that we believe enhances their ability to withstand strong wind and vibrations. A majority of PV modules produced by us have outputs ranging from 110 to 220 watts. The following table sets forth the major types of modules produced by us:

Integrated PV Systems
 
A PV system consists of one or more PV modules that are physically mounted and electrically interconnected with system components such as batteries and power electronics, to produce and store electricity. We produce PV systems and also design, assemble, sell and install stand-alone PV systems for lighting systems, mobile communication base stations and residential applications. In order to focus on our core PV products and their components, we no longer produce controllers, inverters and other components used in our PV systems but instead source them from third-party manufacturers and sell them to our customers as part of our PV systems. We typically install these systems on-site for our customers. For our larger PV systems, we work with the customers on-site to design, install, test and oversee the system start-up. Installation, testing and initial start-up of a PV system generally takes up to four months.
 
Manufacturing
 
We started producing PV modules in 2002 and started producing polysilicon ingots and wafers in October 2003 and PV cells in March 2004. As of the date of this prospectus, we have the capacity to produce up to 200 megawatts each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules per year. We use our polysilicon wafers and PV cells as materials in the production of PV modules. Because our manufacturing capacity for polysilicon wafers used to exceed that for PV cells, we used to have toll manufacturing arrangements with third-party PV cell manufacturers which processed the excess wafers into PV cells for us. We also purchased additional PV cells from third-party trading companies. As we have achieved the same level of manufacturing capacity for each of polysilicon wafers, PV cells and PV modules, we have terminated a majority of our toll manufacturing arrangements with third-party toll manufacturers.
 
Manufacturing Process
 
Polysilicon Ingots.  The quality of polysilicon ingots determines, to a large extent, the quality of our final PV products. To produce polysilicon ingots, polysilicon is melted in a quartz crucible within a furnace. The melted polysilicon then undergoes a crystal growing process, gradually anneals and forms an ingot. To reduce the cost of polysilicon, we use a mix of high-purity polysilicon and lower-purity polysilicon, including polysilicon scraps such as the discarded tops and tails of ingots, pot scraps and broken or unused silicon wafers. Our employees undertake the labor-intensive process of sorting through the polysilicon feedstock to separate polysilicon that meets our specified standards for

the production of ingots. The polysilicon feedstock used in the production of multicrystalline polysilicon ingots is not required to have the same level of purity as that used to produce monocrystalline silicon ingots. Nonetheless, impurities in polysilicon feedstock present a challenge to the production of polysilicon ingots because impurities are difficult to separate in the casting process. After three years of research and development, we have developed a proprietary ingot casting technology that reduces casting time and enables the use of more lower-purity polysilicon, including polysilicon scraps, with minimal adverse effect on the quality of our PV modules.
 
Blocks and Wafers.  Polysilicon ingots are cut into polysilicon blocks, which are edge-ground to avoid breakage during the wafer-slicing process. Polysilicon blocks are then sliced into polysilicon wafers.
 
PV Cells.  The silicon wafers undergo an ultrasonic cleaning process to remove oil and surface particles, after which the wafers undergo a followed chemical cleaning process to remove the impurity and create a suede-like structure on the wafer surface, which reduces the PV cell’s reflection of sunlight and increases the PV cell’s absorption of solar energy. Through a diffusion process, we then introduce certain impurities into the silicon wafers and form an electrical field within the PV cell. We achieve the electrical isolation between the front and back surfaces of the silicon wafer by edge isolation, or removing a very thin layer of silicon around the edge. We then apply an anti-reflection coating to the front surface of the wafer to enhance its absorption of sunlight. We screen-print negative and positive metal contacts, or electrodes, on the front and back surfaces of the PV cell, respectively, with the front contact in a grid pattern to collect the electrical current. Silicon and metal electrodes are then connected through an electrode firing process in a conveyor belt furnace at a high temperature. Testing and sorting complete the manufacturing process for PV cells.
 
The diagram below illustrates the PV cell manufacturing process:
 
(FLOWCHART)
 
PV Modules.  PV modules are formed by interconnecting multiple PV cells into desired electrical configurations through welding. The interconnected cells are laid out, are laminated in a vacuum. Through these processes, the PV modules are weather-sealed, and thus are able to withstand high levels of ultraviolet radiation, moisture, wind and sand. Assembled PV modules are packaged in a protective aluminum frame prior to testing.
 
The following diagram illustrates the PV module manufacturing process:

PV Systems.  PV system production involves the design, sale, installation and testing of PV systems. We design PV systems according to our customers’ requirements. We integrate PV modules and other system components into PV systems by electronically interconnecting PV modules with system components such as inverters, storage batteries and electronic circuitry to produce, store and deliver electricity. For small PV systems such as portable electricity supply systems used for walkie-talkies, we complete the integration and testing procedures in our facilities in Baoding before such systems are sold to the end-customers. For mid-sized PV systems such as PV lighting systems, we complete the integration process in Baoding, but install and test for our customers on-site. For large PV systems, such as on-grid solar power stations and stand-alone PV systems, we work with the customers on-site to design, install, test and oversee the system startup.
 
Manufacturing Capacity Expansion
 
We acquired our first turnkey production line for PV modules in 2001 and started production of PV modules in 2002. We acquired our first turnkey production line for ingots and wafers in 2002. We also acquired our first turnkey fabrication line for high-efficiency PV cells in 2002. The following table sets forth our production capacities for ingot and wafers, PV cells and PV modules at the end of each period indicated.

We launched an expansion project in April 2006 to construct new facilities on a large parcel of land near our existing facilities in Baoding, China. By the end of July 2007, we increased our manufacturing capacity to 200 MW and plan to further increase our manufacturing capacity to 400 MW by the end of 2008. In addition, in October 2007, we formed a new subsidiary, Yingli China, through which we will construct new facilities for an additional 200 MW of manufacturing capacity by the end of 2009. As a result, we expect to increase our annual production capacity for each of polysilicon ingots and wafers, PV cells and PV modules to 400 megawatts by the end of 2008 and 600 megawatts by the end of 2009.
 
Raw Materials
 
Raw materials required in our manufacturing process include polysilicon, polysilicon scraps, crucibles, silicon carbides, cutting fluid, steel cutting wires, metallic pastes, laminate materials, tempered glass, aluminum frames, solder, batteries and other chemical agents and electronic components. We generally use vendors who have demonstrated quality control and reliability and maintain multiple supply sources for each of our key raw materials so as to minimize any potential disruption of our operations from supply problems with any one vendor. We generally evaluate the quality and delivery performance of each vendor periodically and adjust quantity allocations accordingly.
 
We have stocked a significant quantity of polysilicon in response to the worldwide shortage of polysilicon. We had approximately 210 tons of polysilicon and other silicon raw materials in stock as of September 30, 2007 and expect our polysilicon stock to increase further as we secure more polysilicon from our suppliers. We maintain adequate supply of other raw materials based upon periodic estimates of our outstanding customer orders.

Table of Contents

In 2005 and 2006, we purchased the substantial majority of our raw materials (other than polysilicon) from approximately ten to fifteen overseas suppliers and the rest from Chinese suppliers.
 
Because our polysilicon wafer and PV cell outputs have historically been insufficient to satisfy the production needs for our PV module, we purchased less than 10% of our PV cells from trading companies in 2005 and ceased such purchases in 2006. In addition, we have entered into toll manufacturing arrangements pursuant to which we provide our wafers to third-party PV cell manufacturers which process the wafers into PV cells for us. As we have achieved the same level of manufacturing capacity for each of polysilicon wafers, PV cells and PV modules, we have terminated a majority of our toll manufacturing arrangements with third-party toll manufacturers.
 
Silicon Raw Material
 
Polysilicon and polysilicon scraps are the most important raw materials used in our production process. Due to growing global demand for polysilicon, prices for polysilicon have increased substantially in the past few years, a trend we believe will continue in the near term. We have maintained a close relationship with some of the world’s major polysilicon suppliers. We are actively seeking to further strengthen our relationships with our polysilicon suppliers and establish strategic relationships with them. We also have been in active discussions with several other overseas polysilicon suppliers to secure long-term supply contracts, which generally provide for the supply of polysilicon or solar grade silicon feedstock materials at a substantially lower unit price than that obtainable in the spot market or under short-term contracts with a term of one year or less.
 
For example, in August 2006, November 2006, July 2007 and September 2007, we entered into four long-term supply contracts with Wacker Chemie AG, a German polysilicon supplier, for supplies of polysilicon from 2009 through 2013, from 2009 through 2017, from 2010 through 2018 and from 2009 through 2011, respectively. These contracts have terms of 7 years, 11 years, 11 years and 4 years, respectively, and the prices at which polysilicon is supplied under these contracts are subject to adjustment according to the relevant energy price index. We also have contracts with Xinguang, a PRC silicon manufacturer, for the supply of 1,232 tons of polysilicon in 2007 and 2008. As of the date of this prospectus, 50 tons have already been delivered, 182 tons have been committed to be delivered before the end of the first quarter of 2008 with the remaining 1,000 tons to be delivered by the end of 2008. We also entered into a contract with Komex Inc., or Komex, in April 2007, under which Komex will supply 360 tons of silicon materials to us between April 2007 and March 2008. As of the date of this prospectus, we have secured all of our estimated polysilicon needs for 2007 mainly through the supply contracts with Xingguang and Komex and inventory carryover and more than 60% of our currently expected polysilicon needs for 2008 through supply contracts with Xinguang and other suppliers, as determined on the basis of our current capacity expansion plans. However, long-term polysilicon supply contracts with delivery terms of one year or more, which consist of our contracts with Wacker and Xinguang as of the date of this prospectus, will satisfy only a small portion of our long-term polysilicon requirements, as currently estimated based on our capacity expansion plans.
 
Quality Control
 
We employ quality assurance procedures at key stages of our manufacturing process to identify and solve quality problems. Our quality assurance procedures start with raw material quality assurance, which includes annual evaluation of our major raw material suppliers and inspection of all raw materials upon their arrival at our factory. We also have quality control procedures in place at all key stages of our wafer, PV cell and PV module production processes. In addition, all of our wafers, PV cells and PV modules are tested before they are used in the next manufacturing step or sent to our warehouse for sale. If a problem is detected, a failure analysis is performed to determine the cause. To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of our quality assurance procedures, we provide ongoing training to our production line employees. Our senior management team is actively involved in establishing quality assurance policies and managing quality assurance performance on a continuous basis.

Research and Development
 
The primary focus of our research and development efforts is on improving our manufacturing processes at every stage of our production in order to improve the output quality at each stage and deliver more energy-efficient and more aesthetic PV products at a lower cost. In December 2006, we started producing wafers with a thickness of 200 microns. In addition, we are in the process of modifying our equipment and manufacturing process such that they are more suitable for producing wafers with a thickness of less than 200 microns. Our other research goals are to refine our wafer cutting techniques to improve the surface and internal physical characteristics of our wafers so as to decrease the wafer breakage rate and increase the number of wafers produced from each ingot. We are also improving our ingot casting and crystal growing processes to reduce the amount of time required for ingot formation, increase ingot output and reduce the cost of raw materials.
 
According to Solarbuzz in 2006, the manufacturing capacity of PV cells produced from crystalline silicon represented 92% of the manufacturing capacity of the total PV cells, while the remaining 8% was from the manufacturing capacity of PV cells produced from other materials, such as those based on thin film. We believe PV cells made from crystalline silicon will continue to dominate the PV market in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our research and development efforts as they relate to PV cells have focused on improving technologies and processing techniques to increase the conversion efficiency and the power output of our PV cells, all of which are made from multicrystalline silicon. We also seek to reduce the breakage rate and failure rate and increase the success rate and conversion efficiency of our PV cells through the use of advanced equipment and improved manufacturing processes at each stage of our production. To ensure the competitiveness of our products, we closely monitor the development by our competitors of new-generation PV cells, such as thin film cells, that may or may not be made from crystalline silicon and will seek to respond to challenges and opportunities posed by new technology as appropriate.
 
We are upgrading module assembly techniques to accommodate the delicate nature of thinner PV cells. We are also researching new solutions to lengthen our PV modules’ life span and make them more reliable, and to further increase the conversion efficiency of our PV cells and PV modules through the use of new materials and new technologies. In addition, we are working to improve our technologies to manufacture PV modules that can be used as construction materials. We are also exploring multi-purpose applications of our off-grid PV systems, and collaborating with international PV system installers and integrators by participating in large on-grid PV system projects in order to accumulate more experience and knowledge in such projects.
 
Markets and Customers
 
In 2003, we sold most of our products in China. Starting from 2004, our sales to foreign markets increased significantly. Germany became our largest market in 2004 and accounted for 66.8%, 65.5% and 61.2% of our total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. In 2004 and 2005, China was our second largest market and accounted for 23.9% and 15.7% of our total revenues, respectively. Spain was our second largest market in 2006 and accounted for 14.3% of our total revenues in 2006. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, Spain became our largest market and accounted for 57.0% of our total revenues in the first nine months of 2007. For a breakdown of our net revenues by geographic regions in 2004 and 2005 and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006, and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, see note 24 to our consolidated audited financial statements and note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. For the revenue contributions by our customers that individually accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues for 2004, 2005, the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006, see note 2(c) to our consolidated audited financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.

The products that we sell outside of China are primarily PV modules. These modules are sold primarily to installers, PV system integrators, property developers and other value-added resellers, who incorporate our PV modules into large on-grid integrated PV systems with batteries, inverters, mounting structures and wiring systems. In China, we have historically sold our PV modules primarily to government organizations, PV system integrators, telecommunications and broadcasting companies, solar lighting system manufacturers, traffic control equipment manufacturers and waterways inspection system installers for uses in various PV systems.
 
We sell our PV modules typically through supply contracts with a term of less than one year and are obligated to deliver PV modules according to pre-agreed prices and schedules.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We seek to establish long-term sales channels in major international markets for PV modules, including Germany, Spain and the United States. We market and sell our PV modules in these countries directly to a selected number of PV system integrators and installers. We target these customers because we believe our relationships with these PV system integrators and installers enable us to (i) participate in large projects in international markets, (ii) enter new markets more easily, quickly and cost-effectively, (iii) leverage the marketing capabilities of other companies, and (iv) attract new customers.
 
We sell our integrated PV systems in China to end-users directly or to large contractors who use our PV systems in their electricity projects. We employ a total of approximately 30 marketing and sales personnel at our headquarters in Baoding and also in Chengdu and Tibet. We target our sales and marketing efforts at companies in selected industry sectors, including telecommunications, public utilities and transportation. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of integrated PV systems to mobile communications companies in China based on the wattage of PV systems installed. We believe the recent adoption of China’s Renewable Energy Law and the PRC government’s commitment to develop renewable energy sources will contribute to rapid growth of the PV market in China. We plan to leverage our existing relationships with end-users to increase our sales in China, especially our sales of PV systems. As part of our effort to expand overseas, we have built a sales team of 11 representatives located in Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece, and expect to further expand our overseas sales force.
 
In order to avoid brand confusion and build more direct relationships with our customers, we generally do not use sales agents and have actively promoted our brand name through participation in trade shows and exhibitions and advertisements on newspapers and trade magazines.
 
Customer Support and Services
 
We provide customer support and service in China through dedicated teams of technical service personnel located in Baoding, Chengdu and Tibet. Our customer support and service teams coordinate their activities with the marketing, technology, quality and manufacturing departments.
 
Our PV modules are typically sold to customers outside China with a two-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a 10-year and 25-year limited warranty against declines of more than 10.0% and 20.0% in output performance, respectively, from the initial power generation capacity at the time the product is sold. In connection with our PV system installation projects in China, we provide a one- to five-year warranty for our modules, storage batteries, controllers and inverters. Because we have sold our products for less than five years and some of our warranties last for up to 25 years, it is difficult to estimate future incidence of our product failures and associated warranty costs. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry — Unsatisfactory performance or defects in our products may cause us to incur warranty expenses, damage our reputation and cause our sales to decline”.

Intellectual Property
 
We have registered our trademarks “Yingli” and “Songzan” in China and applied for registration of a new trademark “Yingli Solar” in China in June 2006. We have also registered “Yingli Solar” in a number of foreign jurisdictions where we sell or plan to sell our products, including all members of the European Union, the United States and Canada. We have not applied for any patents and relies primarily on trade secret protections and employee and third-party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property. Other than the know-how available in the public domain, we have developed in-house unpatented technical know-how that we use to manufacture our products. Many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data, either developed by us in-house or transferred to us by our equipment suppliers, which are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, equipment designs and algorithms. We have taken security measures to protect these elements. Substantially all of our research and development personnel are parties to confidentiality, non-competition and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies that they develop during their terms of employment with us. We also take other precautions, such as internal document and network assurance and using a separate dedicated server for technical data. We have not had any material intellectual property claims since our inception. See “Risk Factor — Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry — Our lack of patent protection inside and outside of China may undermine our competitive position and subject us to intellectual property disputes with third parties, both of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition”.
 
Competition
 
The PV market is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. The number of PV product manufacturers is rapidly increasing due to the growth of actual and forecast demands for PV products and the relatively low barriers to entry. If we fail to attract and retain customers in our target markets for our current and future core products, namely PV modules and PV systems, we will be unable to increase our revenues and market share.
 
Since 2004, the significant majority of our revenues have been derived from overseas markets, particularly Germany, and increasingly, Spain, Italy and the United States, and we expect these trends to continue. A portion of our revenues are also derived from China. In these markets, we often compete with local and international producers of PV products that are substantially larger than us, including the solar energy divisions of large conglomerates, such as BP Solar and Sharp Corporation, PV module manufacturers, such as Sunpower Corp. and Suntech Power Holdings Co., Ltd., and integrated PV product manufacturers, such as SolarWorld AG and Renewable Energy Corporation.
 
With respect to PV modules, we compete primarily in terms of price, reliability of delivery, consistency in the average wattage of our PV modules, durability, appearance and the quality of after-sale services. We believe our efficient use of raw materials, including our use of polysilicon scraps, combined with our access to low cost labors and facilities in China, make our PV modules competitive in overseas markets. We sell small commercial, personal and home-use PV systems primarily in China where we have competitive advantages over our overseas competitors because of our closer proximity to customers in China and better understanding of their needs. With respect to large integrated PV system projects, we compete primarily in terms of price, design and construction experience, aesthetics and conversion efficiency.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our manufacturing processes generate noise, waste water, gaseous waste and other industrial waste. We have installed various types of anti-pollution equipment in our facilities to reduce, treat, and where feasible, recycle the wastes generated in our manufacturing process. The most significant environmental contaminant we generate is waste water. We have built special facilities to filter and

151

Table of Contents

treat waste water generated in our production process and recycle the water back into our production process. The other major environmental contaminant we generate is gaseous waste. We treat such gas in our special facilities to reduce the contaminant level to below the applicable environmental protection standard before discharging the gas into the atmosphere. Our operations are subject to regulation and periodic monitoring by local environmental protection authorities. The Chinese national and local environmental laws and regulations impose fees for the discharge of waste substances above prescribed levels, require the payment of fines for serious violations and provide that the Chinese national and local governments may at their own discretion close or suspend the operation of any facility that fails to comply with orders requiring it to cease or remedy operations causing environmental damage. No such penalties have been imposed on us or our subsidiary, and we believe that we have complied with applicable environmental regulations and standards in all material respects and have all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business.

conditions of each award, including, but not limited to, the exercise price for an option, vesting schedule of options and restricted shares, forfeiture provisions, form of payment of exercise price and other applicable terms.
 
Change of Control.  The 2006 stock incentive plan defines a “change of control” as the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the sale or disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all, of our assets to any third party; (ii) any third party is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of our voting stock or any entity which controls us (counting the shares that such third party has the right to acquire) by way of merger, consolidation, tender, exchange offer or otherwise; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the board (together with any new directors elected or nominated by such board) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the board, then in office. Upon a change of control, the compensation committee may decide that all outstanding awards that are unexercisable or otherwise unvested or subject to lapse restrictions will automatically be deemed exercisable or otherwise vested or no longer subject to lapse restrictions, as the case may be, as of immediately prior to such acquisition. The compensation committee may also, in its sole discretion, decide to cancel such awards for fair value, provide for the issuance of substitute awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected awards previously granted, or provide that affected options will be exercisable for a period of at least 15 days prior to the acquisition but not thereafter.
 
Amendment and Termination of Plan.  Our board of directors may at any time amend, alter or discontinue the 2006 stock incentive plan. Amendments or alterations to the 2006 stock incentive plan are subject to shareholder approval if they increase the total number of shares reserved for the purposes of the plan or change the maximum number of shares for which awards may be granted to any participant, or if shareholder approval is required by law or by stock exchange rules or regulations. Any amendment, alteration or termination of the 2006 stock incentive plan must not adversely affect awards already granted without written consent of the recipient of such awards. Unless terminated earlier, the 2006 stock incentive plan will continue in effect for a term of ten years from the date of adoption.
 
Amendment No. 1 to the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.  Our board of directors approved in April 2007 and our shareholders approved in May 2007 Amendment No. 1 to the 2006 stock incentive plan, which will amend our 2006 stock incentive plan to increase the number of ordinary shares that we are authorized to issue from 3,394,054 shares to 8,240,658 shares. Among these shares, up to 2,715,243 shares may be issued for the purpose of granting awards of restricted shares and up to 5,525,415 shares may be issued for the purpose of granting options. The amendment will not change any other material provisions of the 2006 stock incentive plan.
 
Options.  An option granted under the 2006 stock incentive plan will have specified terms set forth in an option agreement and will also be subject to the provisions of the 2006 stock incentive plan which include the following principal terms. The compensation committee will determine in the relevant option agreement the purchase price per share upon exercise of the option, with the purchase price of no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the option grant date. The compensation committee will also determine in the relevant option agreement whether the option granted and vested under the award agreement will be exercisable following the recipient’s termination of services with us. If the ordinary shares covered by an option are not exercised or purchased on the last day of the period of exercise, they will terminate. The term of an option granted under the 2006 stock incentive plan may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The consideration to be paid for our ordinary shares upon exercise of an option or purchase of shares underlying the option include cash, check or other cash-equivalent, ordinary shares, consideration received by us in a cashless exercise, or any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. Options granted under the 2006 incentive plan are not transferable and may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the option holders,

except that the compensation committee may permit the options to be exercised by and paid to certain persons or entities related to the option holders.
 
Granted Options.  Prior to our initial public offering, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 610,929 ordinary shares to four executive officers at an exercise price of US$2.10 per share. We agreed to grant options to these executive officers at an exercise price of US$2.10, which was determined with reference to the purchase price per share for the Series A financing transaction, at the time when we began negotiating their respective employment terms in September 2006. However, these options were not granted until December 28, 2006 when we finally adopted the 2006 stock incentive plan.
 
Upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 115,000 ordinary shares to three independent directors and one key employee at an exercise price of US$11.00 per share. In July 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 35,000 ordinary shares to two new employees at an exercise price of US$11.00 per share and US$12.89 per share, respectively. In September 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 125,700 ordinary shares to one executive at an exercise price of US$18.48 per share. In December 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 540,000 ordinary shares to one executive officer and one new employee at an exercise price of US$28.30 per share.
 
Provided the option holder remains a director, officer or employee of ours, each of the relevant option award agreements with the three independent directors provides that the option will vest and become exercisable with respect to one-third of the shares initially covered by the option on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the option grant date, the relevant option award agreements with the four executive officers and two employees provide that the option will vest and become exercisable with respect to 25% of the shares initially covered by the option on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the option grant date, and the relevant option award agreements with two executive officers and two employees provide that the option will vest and become exercisable with respect to 20% of the shares initially covered by the option on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the option grant date. Following the option holder’s termination of service with us for any reason, the option, to the extent not then vested, will be canceled by us without consideration. Upon a change of control, the options will, to the extent not then vested and not previously canceled, become fully vested and exercisable immediately.

Restricted Shares.  Restricted shares issued under the 2006 stock incentive plan will have specified terms set forth in an award agreement and will also be subject to the provisions of the 2006 stock incentive plan. Unless otherwise permitted by the compensation committee, restricted shares are not transferable and may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered at any time prior to becoming vested or during any period in which we may repurchase them.
 
Granted Restricted Shares.  As of the date of this prospectus, our board of directors has issued to DBS Trustees Limited, or the trustee, an aggregate of 2,621,060 restricted but unvested shares for the benefit of 70 trust participants, consisting of (i) an aggregate of 1,606,300 restricted shares granted to nine directors and officers of us and Tianwei Yingli, (ii) an aggregate of 999,760 restricted shares granted to 60 other employees and (iii) 15,000 restricted shares to a non-employee, all pursuant to two restricted stock award agreements and a trust deed. The trustee will hold the restricted shares in trust and will be the registered holder of the restricted shares until such shares are vested, forfeited or repurchased by us. Our board of directors has appointed a managing committee to provide recommendations, advice or instructions to the trustee in connection with the administration of the trust. The restricted stock award agreements and the trust deed contain, among other things, provisions concerning the constitution and structure of the trust, and vesting and forfeiture of the restricted shares, our right to repurchase the restricted shares within a period after vesting of the restricted shares, distribution to trust participants, transfer restrictions, dividends and voting rights, and consequence of third-party acquisition.
 
So long as the trust participant remains a director, officer, employee or consultant of ours, as the case may be, 20% of the restricted shares issued for the benefit of that trust participant will vest on the first anniversary following the award grant date and the remaining 80% will vest ratably in 20% increments on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the award grant date. Restricted shares granted for the benefit of a trust participant will also fully vest upon termination of service resulting from death or disability of the trust participant that is due to work-related reasons. Following a trust participant’s termination of service with us, except if such termination is resulting from the trust participant’s death or disability that is due to work-related reasons, the restricted shares granted for the benefit of such trust participant will, to the extent not then vested, be forfeited without any consideration.
 
For a period of six months after any restricted shares are vested, the trustee will be required to, upon our written request, sell all or part of the vested restricted shares to us at fair market value. The trustee will distribute the repurchase price paid by us, and any dividend accumulated on the repurchased shares from their vesting dates, to us as the agent of the applicable trust participants. Any vested restricted shares that are not repurchased by us during the six-month period will be distributed to us as the agent of the applicable trust participants either in specie or in cash at the option of the applicable trust participants. We will then distribute the repurchase price, the restricted shares or cash, as the case may be, to the applicable trust participants after withholding relevant taxes in accordance with applicable laws.
 
The restricted shares will not be entitled to dividends paid on the ordinary shares until such restricted shares are vested. The restricted shares will have the same voting rights as our other ordinary shares. All voting rights of the restricted shares will be exercised by the trustee in
163

accordance with the managing committee’s instructions before the restricted shares are vested, and in accordance with the instructions of the applicable trust participants after the restricted shares are vested. Upon a change of control, all restricted shares granted to the trustee for the benefit of the trust participants will become fully vested immediately.
 
The following table summarizes, as of the date of this prospectus, the outstanding restricted shares granted to the trustee for the benefit of the following directors and executive officers of us and Tianwei Yingli and the other trust participants pursuant to the 2006 stock incentive plan.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
Transactions with Mr. Liansheng Miao and Entities Controlled by Mr. Miao
 
We were incorporated in August 2006 as a Cayman Islands exempted company by Mr. Liansheng Miao to serve as an offshore listing vehicle for Tianwei Yingli and facilitate the flow of foreign investment into Tianwei Yingli.
 
Tianwei Yingli was co-founded in August 1998 by Yingli Group, a PRC limited liability company, which was founded and is 100% owned by Mr. Miao. Tianwei Yingli became our predecessor and subsidiary on September 5, 2006, when Yingli Group transferred its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to us. See “History and Restructuring — Restructuring”.
 
Our controlling shareholder is Yingli Power, a British Virgin Islands corporation, which is 100% owned by the family trust of Mr. Miao. In August 2006, Yingli Power made an initial capital contribution of US$500,000 to us in exchange for 50,000,000 of our ordinary shares, and in September 2006, it made an additional capital contribution of US$100,000 to us in exchange for 9,800,000 of our ordinary shares.
 
Yingli Power also served as an intermediary in our securing equity-linked debt financing from Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore branch. On November 13, 2006, we issued US$85 million in aggregate of mandatory convertible bonds and mandatory redeemable bonds to Yingli Power, which on the same date issued mandatory exchangeable notes and mandatory redeemable notes to Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore branch for the same aggregate amount and on substantially similar terms (other than the split for the exchangeable or convertible portion). See “— Private Equity Investments and Other Financings — Mandatory Redeemable Bonds and Mandatory Convertible Bonds”. We repaid in full the mandatory redeemable bonds issued to Yingli Power in the principal amount of US$35.3 million with part of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering.
 
Yingli Group has had a series of financial transactions with Tianwei Yingli. Prior to December 31, 2002, Yingli Group borrowed RMB 8.4 million.

The respective rights and obligations of us and Tianwei Baobian as the shareholders of Tianwei Yingli are governed by a joint venture contract, which is dated August 25, 2006 and amended from to time to reflect, among others, the changes in the respective equity holdings by us and Tianwei Baobian. The joint venture contract, which is governed by PRC law, provides that, among others, Tianwei Baobian has a right, after our initial public offering, to subscribe for a number of our ordinary shares in exchange for all but not part of its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli at the time of the exercise according to a formula set forth in the joint venture contract. For further description of this subscription right and other key provisions of the joint venture contract, see “History and Restructuring — Joint Venture Contract”.

As of the date of this prospectus, Tianwei Yingli had no outstanding loans from Tianwei Baobian or its affiliates.
 
Historically, Tianwei Baobian and its controlling shareholder, Tianwei Group, also guaranteed or entrusted a substantial portion of Tianwei Yingli’s short-term borrowings from banks and other parties.

These loans bore interest in the range of 3.78% to 7.29% and typically had a maturity of one to 12 months. As of December 31, 2004, 2005, 2006 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, these guaranteed and entrusted loans amounted to RMB 80.0 million, RMB 234.0 million, RMB 232.0 million (US$31.0 million) and RMB 472.4 million (US$63.0 million), respectively, or 87.0%, 67.5%, 86.8% and 41.0% of our short-term borrowings as of the same dates.

Series A Preferred Shares and Related Warrant
 
On September 28, 2006, we issued to Inspiration Partners Limited 8,081,081 Series A preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$17.0 million. On the same date, we also issued to TB Management Ltd., an affiliate of Inspiration Partners Limited, a warrant to purchase 678,811 of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$2.10 per share.

All outstanding Series A preferred shares held by Inspiration Partners Limited were automatically converted into our ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007 at a conversion ratio of one-to-one. The proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Series A preferred shares were used to finance the transfer to us of the 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli held by Yingli Group.
 
Mandatory Redeemable Bonds and Mandatory Convertible Bonds
 
On November 13, 2006, we issued interest-bearing mandatory redeemable bonds and mandatory convertible bonds to Yingli Power in the aggregate principal amount of US$85 million and at an issue price equal to 98.75% of such aggregate principal amount. The mandatory redeemable bonds in the principal amount of US$38 million were required to be redeemed at their principal amount upon the completion of our initial public offering. The mandatory convertible bonds with the principal amount of US$47 million were automatically convertible into our equity interest at an aggregate value equal to the value of a 3.73% effective equity interest in Tianwei Yingli at the time of the conversion upon the completion of our initial public offering. The net proceeds from these bonds were used (i) up to US$62 million, to increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli from 53.98% to 62.13% (which event occurred on December 18, 2006), (ii) up to US$17 million, to further increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, (iii) US$4.5 million to be held in a restricted account to be used to service the first three interest payments falling due under these bonds and (iv) the remaining proceeds for general corporate purpose and working capital. Upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007, we redeemed the mandatory redeemable bonds and issued 5,340,088 of our ordinary shares to Yingli Power upon conversion of the mandatory convertible bonds.
 
In connection with the issuance of these bonds, on November 13, 2006, our controlling shareholder, Yingli Power, issued to Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch, floating rate notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$85 million and at an issue price equal to 98.75% of such aggregate

principal amount. The floating rate notes consisted of US$55 million mandatory redeemable notes and US$30 million mandatory exchangeable notes exchangeable into equity interests in us at an aggregate value substantially equal to the value of a 3.73% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli at the time of the exchange upon the completion of our initial public offering, the terms of which (other than the allocation of the principal amounts between the redeemable and convertible or exchangeable portions) were substantially similar to the terms of the mandatory redeemable bonds and the mandatory convertible bonds issued by us to Yingli Power. Yingli Power used the proceeds from the issuance of the floating rate notes to subscribe for the mandatory redeemable bonds and the mandatory convertible bonds issued by us. Yingli Power pledged to Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch all of its then existing equity interest in us and its other tangible and intangible asset as collateral for its obligations under these floating rate notes. Upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007, Yingli Power redeemed the mandatory redeemable notes and delivered 4,612,816 of our ordinary shares to Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch, and several underlying investors of these notes upon exchange of the mandatory exchangeable notes.
 
Series B Preferred Shares
 
During the period from December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007, we issued to Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, an affiliate of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, and 13 other investors, including J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., a total of 24,405,377 Series B preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of US$118 million, or at US$4.835 per share. Of the US$118 million proceeds, US$17 million was received as advance payments and was used to increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 53.98% from 51%, US$22.6 million (together with US$17 million from portions of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of the mandatory redeemable bonds and the mandatory convertible bonds) will be injected into Tianwei Yingli in the form of a direct equity contribution and the remaining US$78.4 million was injected into Tianwei Yingli in the form of a shareholder loan from us to Tianwei Yingli and would be converted into equity interest in Tianwei Yingli upon completion of the relevant PRC regulatory approvals and related procedural formalities. In addition, during this period, we granted to such investors, other than the three investors who had made advance payments, warrants to purchase 2,112,057 of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$0.01 per share, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions. On or about March 27, 2007, we further issued to the Series B preferred shareholders (other than the three investors who had made advance payments) additional warrants with terms similar to the previously issued Series B warrants to purchase an aggregate of 688,090 of our ordinary shares in exchange for the early termination of an escrow arrangement with certain restriction, which made the release of a portion of the proceeds, in an amount of US$19.6 million, that were received from the issuance and sale of the Series B preferred shares contingent upon our obtaining the relevant PRC regulatory approvals and completion of related procedural formalities in connection with the conversion of the shareholder loan into equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. This amount of US$19.6 million was injected into Tianwei Yingli upon removal of such restriction in the form of entrusted loan from us to satisfy Tianwei Yingli’s working capital requirement. All outstanding Series B preferred shares were automatically converted into our ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007 at a conversion ratio of one-to-one.
 
Capital Contributions to Tianwei Yingli
 
On October 10, 2006, we amended the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian, holder of a minority equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, our principal operating entity, to make an equity contribution of US$17 million to Tianwei Yingli. The equity contribution was consummated on November 20, 2006, which increased our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 53.98% from 51%. This equity contribution was funded with advance payments in an aggregate amount of US$17 million from three of our Series B preferred shareholders described below.
 
On November 13, 2006, we further amended the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian to make an additional equity contribution of US$62 million to Tianwei Yingli. The equity contribution was

175

Table of Contents

consummated on December 18, 2006 and was funded with proceeds from the issuance of the mandatory convertible bonds and the mandatory redeemable bonds. This equity contribution increased our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 62.13% from 53.98%.
 
On December 18, 2006, we further amended the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian to make an additional equity contribution of US$118 million to Tianwei Yingli. Of the aggregate proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Series B preferred shares, US$17 million, which was received as advance payments, was used to increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 53.98% from 51%, US$22.6 million (together with US$17 million from portions of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of the mandatory redeemable bonds and the mandatory convertible bonds) will be injected into Tianwei Yingli in the form of a direct equity contribution upon the completion of relevant PRC registration procedures, and the remaining US$78.4 million was injected into Tianwei Yingli in the form of a shareholder loan from us to Tianwei Yingli which will be converted into equity interest in Tianwei Yingli upon obtaining approval from the SAFE, Baoding Branch. Upon the completion of relevant PRC registration procedures for the direct equity contribution and the conversion of the shareholder loan into equity interest in Tianwei Yingli on June 25, 2007, which resulted in the additional equity contribution of an aggregate amount of US$118 million to Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital, our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli increased to 70.11% from 62.13%.
 
On September 28, 2007, we further amended the joint venture contract with Tianwei Baobian to make an additional equity contribution of the U.S. dollar equivalent of RMB 1,750.84 million to Tianwei Yingli, increasing Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital from RMB 1,624.4 million to RMB 3,375.22 million. Under PRC laws, the increase of Tianwei Baobian’s registered capital is subject to approval by the relevant PRC authority. We expect to obtain such approval by the end of 2007. Upon obtaining the requisite approval, we are required by the amended joint venture contract to make the additional equity contribution within 60 days of the approval. We plan to fund the equity contribution primarily using part of proceeds from our initial public offering. This equity contribution would increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 74.01% from 70.11%.
 
China Sunshine Warrant
 
In connection with a convertible loan to Tianwei Yingli from China Foreign Economic and Trade & Investment Co., Ltd., or FOTIC, a trust and investment company established in China, FOTIC acted as a nominee for certain third-party individuals. This convertible loan was made on May 17, 2006. Under a repayment and termination agreement dated December 29, 2006 among Tianwei Yingli, FOTIC, China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd., or China Sunshine, a British Virgin Islands investment holding company, and us, Tianwei Yingli repaid the convertible loan in the principal amount of RMB 85,635,000 (US$11,428,972) plus accrued interest of RMB 4,281,750 (US$571,449) on December 29, 2006. As a condition of repayment, under the repayment and termination agreement, we issued on December 29, 2006 to China Sunshine a warrant to purchase 2,068,252 of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$4.835 per share. On February 2, 2007, China Sunshine fully exercised this warrant at an exercise price per share of US$4.835 and purchased 2,068,252 of our ordinary shares.
 
The issuance of the warrant was a condition of repayment of the referenced convertible loan due to a number of legal considerations and business arrangements between relevant parties. The parties to the convertible loan understood that at the time the convertible loan was made, the lenders’ intention was to exercise the conversion right under the convertible loan for an equity interest in an offshore listing vehicle for Tianwei Yingli to be listed on an overseas stock exchange. However, after the convertible loan was made, the parties to the loan agreement became aware of certain PRC legal and regulatory considerations which cast some uncertainties into the enforceability and legality under PRC laws of the conversion of the loan, which is RMB -denominated. Specifically, the original transaction contemplated the exercise by certain third party individuals or a PRC entity, namely FOTIC as the nominee for the third party individuals, of a conversion right under a loan agreement with another PRC entity, namely Tianwei Yingli, for an equity interest in an offshore entity that is the controlling shareholder, namely Yingli Green Energy, of the second PRC entity, namely Tianwei Yingli,

176

Table of Contents

which was a relatively novel arrangement in the PRC for which the parties could not find sufficient precedents or clear legal authority to establish the legality of such arrangement. Accordingly, in order to reduce the potential legal and/or regulatory uncertainties, Yingli Green Energy agreed to repay the debt and also agreed to the lenders’ designation of China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd., an entity incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and unrelated to the lenders, as the holder of the conversion right, which in the final arrangement took the form of a warrant.
 
The inclusion of the warrant as a condition to repayment of the loan also served the business interests of both Yingli Green Energy and the lenders. The arrangements that the parties agreed upon were that (i) Yingli Green Energy would repay the loan in full, including the accrued interest, (ii) Yingli Green Energy would issue a warrant to the lenders’ designated entity, China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd., and such warrant would be exercisable into Yingli Green Energy’s equity interest that would be substantially equal to the principal amount of the loan, and (iii) to the extent China Sunshine exercises the warrant, the majority of the proceeds from the repayment would effectively be returned to Yingli Green Energy in the form of the exercise price paid by China Sunshine (which was US$4.835 per share, or the share price paid by the investors in Yingli Green Energy’s Series B preferred shares), and (iv) China Sunshine would have a reasonably short period of time (which was fixed at 45 days under the repayment agreement) to exercise the warrant. The repayment agreement dated December 29, 2006 reflected the foregoing arrangements. The above arrangement helped eliminate a potential liquidity risk associated with an immediate loan repayment for Yingli Green Energy while allowing the lenders to designate its conversion right to China Sunshine.
 
Employment Agreements
 
We have entered into employment agreements with all of our executive officers. Under these agreements, each of our executive officers is employed for a specified time period. We may terminate his or her employment for cause at any time, with prior written notice, for certain acts of the executive officer, including but not limited to a conviction to a felony, or willful gross misconduct by the executive officer in connection with his or her employment, and in each case if such acts have resulted in material and demonstrable financial harm to us.

Furthermore, either party may terminate the employment agreement at any time without cause upon advance written notice to the other party. Upon termination, the executive officer is generally entitled to a severance pay of at least one month’s salary.

PRC GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 
This section sets forth a summary of the most significant regulations or requirements that affect our business activities in China. Certain of these regulations and requirements, such as those relating to tax, equity joint ventures, foreign currency exchange, dividend distribution, regulation of foreign exchange in certain onshore and offshore transactions, and regulations of overseas listings, may affect our shareholders’ right to receive dividends and other distributions from us.
 
Renewable Energy Law and Other Government Directives
 
In February 2005, China enacted its Renewable Energy Law, which became effective on January 1, 2006. The Renewable Energy Law sets forth policies to encourage the development and use of solar energy and other non-fossil energy. The Renewable Energy Law sets forth the national policy to encourage and support the use of solar and other renewable energy and the use of on-grid generation. It also authorizes the relevant pricing authorities to set favorable prices for the purchase of surplus electricity generated by solar and other renewable power generation systems.
 
The law sets forth the national policy to encourage the installation and use of solar energy water-heating systems, solar energy heating and cooling systems, PV systems and other solar energy utilization systems. It also provides financial incentives, such as national funding, preferential loans and tax preferences for the development of renewable energy projects. In January 2006, China’s National Development and Reform Commission promulgated two regulations to implement the Renewable Energy Law. These regulations set forth specific measures for setting prices for electricity generated by solar and other renewal power generation companies and in sharing additional expenses occurred. The regulations further allocate the administrative and supervisory authorities among different government agencies at the national and provincial levels and provide responsibilities of electricity grid companies and power generation companies with respect to the implementation of the Renewable Energy Law.
 
China’s Ministry of Construction issued a directive in June of 2005, which seeks to expand the use of solar energy in residential and commercial buildings and encourages the increased application of solar energy in townships. In addition, China’s State Council promulgated a directive in June of 2005, which sets forth specific measures to conserve energy resources and encourage exploration, development and use of solar energy in China’s western areas, which are not fully connected to electricity transmission grids, and other rural areas.
 
On April 28, 2007, China’s National Development and Reform Commission issued a Circular on the Eleventh Five-year Plan for the Development of High-Technology Industry, pursuant to which China encourages the production of energy materials, including the high-quality silicon materials for solar cell, in order to establish the independent research and production system of new energy materials.
 
In July 2007, the PRC State Electricity Regulatory Commission issued the Supervision Regulations on the Purchase of All Renewable Energy by Power Grid Enterprises which became effective on September 1, 2007. To promote the use of renewable energy for power generation, the regulations require that electricity grid enterprises must in a timely manner set up connections between the grids and renewable power generation systems and purchase all the electricity generated by renewable power generation systems. The regulations also provide that power dispatch institutions shall give priority to renewable power generation companies in respect of power dispatch services provision.
 
On September 4, the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, implemented the National Medium- and Long-Term Programs for Renewable Energy, or MLPRE, aiming to raise consumption of electricity from renewable sources to 10% and 15% of total electricity consumption by 2010 and 2020, up from 7.5% in 2005, which highlights the government’s long-term commitment to the development of renewable energy.
 
On October 28, 2007, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted amendments to the PRC Energy-saving Law, which sets forth policies to encourage the energy saving

178

Table of Contents

in manufacturing, civic buildings, transportation, government agents and utilities sectors. The amendments also seeks to expand the use of the solar energy in construction areas.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our manufacturing processes generate noise, waste water, gaseous waste and other industrial waste. We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. The major environmental regulations applicable to us include the Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, Implementation Rules of the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, Implementation Rules of the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, the Law of PRC on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, and the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution.
 
Equity Joint Ventures
 
Tianwei Yingli, as a Sino-foreign equity joint venture enterprise, is an equity joint venture subject to certain PRC laws and regulations. Equity joint ventures as a form of foreign investment permitted in China, are primarily governed by the following laws and regulations:
 
 	• 	The Company Law (1993), as amended;
 
 	• 	The Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprises (1979), as amended; and
 
 	• 	Rules on Implementation of the Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprises (1983), as amended.
 
An equity joint venture is a limited liability company under PRC law and its establishment is subject to the approval of MOFCOM or its authorized local counterpart where such equity joint venture is located. The board of directors is the highest authority of an equity joint venture and has the power to decide all matters important to the equity joint venture. Each director is appointed for a term of three years and may serve consecutive terms if appointed by the party by which he or she was originally appointed. Each director may be removed by its appointing party, at any time, with or without cause and may be replaced by a nominee appointed by such party before the expiration of such director’s term of office.
 
Resolutions of the board of directors of an equity joint venture involving any matters may be adopted by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of all directors present in person or by proxy at a meeting of the board, except that resolutions involving the following matters require a unanimous approval of all directors present in person or by proxy at the meeting of the board:
 
 	• 	amendment to the articles of association of the equity joint venture;
 
 	• 	merger of the equity joint venture with another entity;
 
 	• 	division of the equity joint venture;
 
 	• 	termination or dissolution of the equity joint venture; and
 
 	• 	increase, reduction or transfer of the registered capital of the equity joint venture.
 
Tax
 
Enterprise Income Tax
 
PRC enterprise income tax is calculated based on taxable income determined under PRC accounting principles. In accordance with the FIE Income Tax Law and the related implementing rules, foreign invested enterprises established in the PRC are generally subject to an income tax rate of 33.0% (consisting of 30.0% enterprise income tax and 3.0% local income tax). The FIE Income Tax Law and the related implementing rules provide certain favorable tax treatments to certain foreign invested enterprises. PRC domestic companies are governed by the Enterprise Income Tax Provisional Regulations of the PRC and are generally subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 33.0%, although those enterprises that qualify as “high and new technology enterprises” and are

179

Table of Contents

registered and operate in “national high-tech zones” are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15.0%.
 
On March 16, 2007, the EIT Law was enacted, and will become effective on January 1, 2008 when the FIE Income Tax Law and the Enterprise Income Tax Provisional Regulations of the PRC are scheduled to expire. The EIT Law adopts a uniform tax rate of 25% for all enterprises (including foreign-invested enterprises) and revokes the current tax exemption, reduction and preferential treatments only applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. However, any enterprises established before the promulgation of the EIT Law that are entitled to preferential tax treatments for a fixed period will continue to be entitled to such preferential tax treatments until the expiration of such period. If the fixed period has not commenced because of tax losses, it shall be deemed to commence in 2008.
 
Under the EIT Law, “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State” would be entitled to a preferential tax rate of 15%, but the EIT Law does not define “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State”. Unlike the FIE Income Tax Law, the EIT Law provides that an income tax rate of 20% will normally be applicable to dividends payable to foreign investors and does not specifically exempt withholding tax on dividend payable to foreign investors. Although the EIT Law provides for the possibility of withholding tax exemption or reduction for China source income, the details have not been published.
 
Under the EIT Law, enterprises established under the laws of foreign countries or regions whose “de facto management bodies” are located within the PRC territory are considered resident enterprises and will normally be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income, but the EIT Law does not define the term “de facto management bodies”. Substantially all of our management is currently located in the PRC, and if they remain located in the PRC after the effective date of the EIT Law, Yingli Green Energy may be considered a resident enterprise and therefore be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income.
 
Tianwei Yingli, which is registered and operates in a “national high-tech zone” in Baoding, China, qualifies as a “high and new technology enterprise” under the FIE Income Tax Law and as a result has been entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15.0% through 2007. In accordance with the PRC Income Tax Law for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises and the related implementing rules, as a foreign invested enterprise primarily engaged in manufacturing, Tianwei Yingli is entitled to a two-year exemption from the 15.0% enterprise income tax for its first two profitable years following its conversion into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company, which are currently expected to be 2007 and 2008 for purposes of relevant PRC tax regulations. Tianwei Yingli will thereafter be entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 7.5% for the succeeding three years, or until 2011. Yingli Green Energy would also be exempted from the withholding tax on dividends it receives from Tianwei Yingli.
 
Under the EIT Law, Tianwei Yingli will continue to be entitled to the two-year exemption and three-year half reduction preferential treatment for the period from 2007 to 2011 or 2008 to 2012 if it fails to record profits for the year of 2007; therefore, it will be exempted from the enterprise income tax for its first two profitable years following its conversion into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company, which are currently expected to be 2007 and 2008. If Tianwei Yingli qualifies as a “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State” under the EIT Law, it will be entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 7.5% from 2009 until 2011 and the preferential income tax rate of 15% will be applicable to Tianwei Yingli starting from 2012. If Tianwei Yingli fails to qualify as a “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State” under the EIT Law, it will be entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 12.5% from 2009 until 2011 and the standard tax rate of 25% will be applicable to Tianwei Yingli starting from 2012. As Yingli China was established on October 16, 2007, Yingli China’s income tax rate will be 25% starting from January 1, 2008. If Yingli China qualifies as a “high and new technology enterprise strongly supported by the State”, it will benefit from a preferential tax rate of 15% subject to the more detailed implementing rules to be adopted in the future. Otherwise, the applicable tax rate of Yingli China will be the unified tax rate of 25% under the EIT

Law. For risks and uncertainties related to the EIT Law, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — A newly enacted PRC tax law could increase the enterprise income tax rate applicable to our principal subsidiaries in China, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations”.
 
Value Added Tax
 
Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Value Added Tax and their implementing rules, all entities and individuals that are engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of repairs and replacement services and the importation of goods in China are generally required to pay value added tax at a rate of 17.0% of the gross sales proceeds received, less any deductible value added tax already paid or borne by the taxpayer. In addition, when exporting goods, the exporter is entitled to a portion of or all the refund of value added tax that it has already paid or borne. Tianwei Yingli’s imported raw materials that are used for manufacturing export products and are deposited in bonded warehouses are exempt from import value added tax.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange
 
Foreign currency exchange in China is primarily governed by the following rules:
 
 	• 	Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended; and
 
 	• 	Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996).
 
Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, the Renminbi is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of, and/or the registration with, the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE or its local branches.
 
Under the Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from the SAFE or its local branches. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce, the SAFE and the National Reform and Development Commission or their local counterparts. Currently, the PRC laws and regulations do not provide clear criteria as to how to obtain the SAFE approval. The SAFE and its local branches have broad discretion as to whether to issue the SAFE approval.
 
Dividend Distribution
 
The principal regulations governing distribution of dividends paid by Sino-foreign equity joint venture enterprises include:
 
 	• 	The Company Law (1993), as amended;
 
 	• 	The Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprises (1979), as amended; and
 
 	• 	Rules on Implementation of the Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprises (1983), as amended.
 
Under these regulations, Sino-foreign equity joint venture enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC GAAP. The board of directors of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to reserve funds, employee bonus and welfare funds and enterprise development funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners as dividends.
 
Regulation of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions
 
In October 2005, the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Return

181

Table of Contents

Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or SAFE Notice 75, which became effective as of November 1, 2005, and was further supplemented by an implementing notice issued by the SAFE on November 24, 2005. SAFE Notice 75 suspends the implementation of two prior regulations promulgated in January and April of 2005 by SAFE. SAFE Notice 75 states that Chinese residents, whether natural or legal persons, must register with the relevant local SAFE branch prior to establishing or taking control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving onshore assets or equity interests held by them. The term “Chinese legal person residents” as used in the SAFE Notice 75 refers to those entities with legal person status or other economic organizations established within the territory of China. The term “Chinese natural person residents” as used in the SAFE Notice 75 includes all Chinese citizens and all other natural persons, including foreigners, who habitually reside in China for economic benefit. The SAFE implementing notice of November 24, 2005 further clarifies that the term Chinese natural person residents as used under SAFE Notice 75 refers to those “Chinese natural person residents” defined under the relevant PRC tax laws and those natural persons who hold any interests in domestic entities which are classified as “domestic-funding” interests.
 
Chinese residents are required to complete amended registrations with the local SAFE branch upon (i) injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise to the offshore entity, or (ii) subsequent overseas equity financing by such offshore entity. Chinese residents are also required to complete amended registrations or filing with the local SAFE branch within 30 days of any material change in the shareholding or capital of the offshore entity, such as changes in share capital, share transfers and long-term equity or debt investments, and providing security. Chinese residents who have already incorporated or gained control of offshore entities that have made onshore investment in China before SAFE Notice 75 was promulgated must register their shareholding in the offshore entities with the local SAFE branch on or before March 31, 2006.
 
Under SAFE Notice 75, Chinese residents are further required to repatriate back into China all of their dividends, profits or capital gains obtained from their shareholdings in the offshore entity within 180 days of their receipt of such dividends, profits or capital gains. The registration and filing procedures under SAFE Notice 75 are prerequisites for other approval and registration procedures necessary for capital inflow from the offshore entity, such as inbound investments or shareholders loans, or capital outflow to the offshore entity, such as the payment of profits or dividends, liquidating distributions, equity sale proceeds, or the return of funds upon a capital reduction.
 
To further clarify the implementation of Circular 75, the SAFE issued Circular No. 106 on May 29, 2007. Under Circular No. 106, PRC subsidiaries of an offshore special purpose company are required to coordinate and supervise the filing of SAFE registrations by the offshore holding company’s shareholders who are PRC residents in a timely manner. If these shareholders fail to comply, the PRC subsidiaries are required to report to the local SAFE authorities. If the PRC subsidiaries of the offshore parent company do not report to the local SAFE authorities, they may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to their offshore parent company and the offshore parent company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the above SAFE registration requirements could result in liabilities under PRC laws for evasion of foreign exchange restrictions.
 
Regulation of Overseas Listings
 
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, and the SAFE, jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, which became effective on September 8, 2006. This regulation, among other things, has some provisions that purport to require that an offshore SPV formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV’s securities on an overseas stock exchange.

182

Table of Contents

On September 21, the CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by SPVs. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with the CSRC and it would probably take several months to complete the approval process if a waiver is not available.
 
The application of this new PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope of the applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.
 
Our PRC counsel, Fangda Partners, has advised us that the CSRC approval was not required for our initial public offering and the listing of our ADSs on the NYSE and this offering. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government agency, including the MOFCOM or other applicable departments of the CSM, would reach the same conclusion as our PRC counsel:
 
 	• 	The CSRC has jurisdiction over our initial public offering and this offering;
 
 	• 	Given that we completed the transfer of the controlling equity interest in Tianwei Yingli from Yingli Group before September 8, 2006, the date on which the new regulation became effective, it was not necessary for us to submit an application to the CSRC to obtain its approval of the listing and subsequent trading of our ADSs on the NYSE; and
 
 	• 	If an application for CSRC approval was required from us, we have a justifiable basis to request a waiver from the CSRC, if and when such procedures are established to obtain such a waiver.
 
Regulations of Employee Share Options
 
In December 2006, the People’s Bank of China promulgated the Administrative Measures on Individual Person Foreign Exchange, or the PBOC Regulation, setting forth the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by individuals (both PRC or non-PRC citizens) under the current account and the capital account. In January 2007 SAFE issued the implementation rules for the PBOC Regulation which, among others, specified the approval requirement for certain capital account transactions such as a PRC citizen’s participation in the employee stock ownership plan or stock options plan of an overseas listed company. On March 28, 2007, SAFE promulgated the Operating Procedures on Administration of Foreign Exchange regarding PRC Individuals’ Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Stock Option Plan of Overseas Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Rule, to further clarify the formalities and application documents in connection with the subject matter. Under the Stock Option Rule, PRC individuals who will participate in the employment stock ownership plan or the stock option plan of an overseas listed company are required to appoint a domestic agent to deal with the relevant foreign exchange matters in the PRC. For participants of an employment stock ownership plan, an overseas custodian bank should be retained by the domestic agent to hold on trusteeship all overseas assets held by such participants under the employment stock ownership plan. In the case of a stock option plan, a financial institution with stock brokerage qualification at the place where the overseas listed company is listed or a qualified institution designated by the overseas listed company is required to be retained to handle matters in connection with exercise or sale of stock options for the stock option plan participants. For participants who had already participated in an employment stock ownership plan or stock option plan before the date of the Stock Option Rule, the Stock Option Rule requires their domestic employers or domestic agents to make up for the relevant formalities within three months of the date of the Stock Option Rule. The failure to comply with the Stock Option Rule may subject the plan participants, the company offering the plan or the relevant intermediaries, as the case may be, to penalties under PRC foreign exchange regime. However, as these rules have only been recently promulgated, it is currently unclear as to how these rules will be interpreted and implemented.

We have contacted the Baoding branch of SAFE and attempted to submit documents prepared for their registration. Officials at the local SAFE branch in Baoding acknowledged receipt of such documents but refused to indicate whether they would effect the registration under the Stock Option Rule. We are seeking further guidance from the relevant government authorities and will promptly take all steps to comply with their requirements when they become available.

DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL
 
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability and our affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and the Companies Law, Cap. 22 (Law 3 of 1961), as consolidated and revised of the Cayman Islands, which is referred to as the Companies Law below.
 
As of the date of this prospectus, our authorized share capital consists of 1,000,000,000 shares, with a par value of US$0.01 each. As of the date hereof, there are 126,923,609 ordinary shares (excluding 2,621,060 restricted shares issued but unvested under our 2006 stock incentive plan) issued and outstanding. As of the date of this prospectus, 29,500,000, or 23.24% of our outstanding ordinary shares (excluding all unvested restricted shares) in the form of ADSs are held by 4 record holders in the United States.
 
The following are summaries of material provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the Companies Law insofar as they relate to the material terms of our ordinary shares.
 
Meetings
 
An annual general meeting and any extraordinary general meeting is required to be called by not less than ten days’ notice in writing. Notice of every general meeting will be given to all our shareholders other than such as, under the provisions of our articles of association or the terms of issue of the shares they hold, are not entitled to receive such notices from us, and also to our principal external auditors.
 
Notwithstanding that a meeting is called by shorter notice than that mentioned above, it will be deemed to have been duly called, if it is so agreed (i) in the case of a meeting called as an annual general meeting by all our shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting; (ii) in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number of the shareholders having a right to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than 95% in nominal value of the shares giving that right.
 
No business other than the appointment of a chairperson shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the commencement of business. However, the absence of a quorum will not preclude the appointment of a chairperson of the meeting. If present, the chairperson of our board of directors will be the chairperson presiding at any shareholders’ meeting.
 
Two of our shareholders present in person or by proxy or corporate representative representing not less than one-third in nominal value of our total issued voting shares will be a quorum.
 
A corporation being a shareholder will be deemed for the purpose of our articles of association to be present in person if represented by its duly authorized representative being the person appointed by resolution of the directors or other governing body of such corporation to act as its representative at the relevant general meeting or at any relevant general meeting of any class of our shareholders. Such duly authorized representative will be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were our individual shareholder.
 
The quorum for a separate general meeting of the holders of a separate class of shares is described in “— Modification of Rights” below.
 
Voting Rights Attaching to the Shares
 
At any general meeting on a show of hands every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or, in the case of a shareholder being a corporation, by its duly authorized representative) will have one vote, and on a poll every shareholder present in person or by proxy (or, in the case of a shareholder being a corporation, by its duly appointed representative) will have one vote for each

Table of Contents

share which such shareholder is the holder. Our board of directors may issue shares with or have attached thereto such rights or restrictions whether in regard to dividend, voting, redemption privileges or otherwise.
 
Any ordinary resolution to be passed by our shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast at a meeting of our shareholders, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the votes cast at a meeting of our shareholders. Holders of our shares may by ordinary resolution, among other things, elect or remove directors, and make alterations of capital. See “— Alteration of Capital”. A special resolution is required for matters such as a change of name. See “— Modification of Rights”.
 
No shareholder is entitled to vote or be reckoned in a quorum, in respect of any share unless such shareholder is registered as our shareholder at the applicable record date for that meeting and all calls or installments due by such shareholder to us have been paid.
 
If a recognized clearing house (or its nominee(s)) is our shareholder, it may authorize such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative(s) at any meeting or at any meeting of any class of shareholders provided that, if more than one person is so authorized, the authorization must specify the number and class of shares in respect of which each such person is so authorized. A person authorized pursuant to this provision is deemed to have been duly authorized without further evidence of the facts and be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the recognized clearing house (or its nominee(s)) as if such person was the registered holder of our shares held by that clearing house (or its nominee(s)).
 
Protection of Minorities
 
The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands may, on the application of shareholders holding not less than one-fifth of our shares in issue, appoint an inspector to examine our affairs and to report thereon in a manner as the Grand Court shall direct.
 
Any shareholder may petition the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands which may make a winding up order, if the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that we should be wound up.
 
Claims against us by our shareholders must, as a general rule, be based on the general laws of contract or tort applicable in the Cayman Islands or their individual rights as shareholders as established by our memorandum and articles of association.
 
The Cayman Islands courts ordinarily would be expected to follow English case law precedents which permit a minority shareholder to commence a representative action against, or derivative actions in our name to challenge (a) an act which is beyond the power of a company or illegal, (b) an act which constitutes a fraud against the minority and the wrongdoers are themselves in control of us, and (c) an irregularity in the passing of a resolution which requires a qualified (or special) majority.
 
Pre-emption Rights
 
There are no pre-emption rights applicable to the issue of new shares under either Cayman Islands law or our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.
 
Liquidation Rights
 
Subject to any special rights, privileges or restrictions as to the distribution of available surplus assets on liquidation for the time being attached to any class or classes of shares (i) if we are wound up and the assets available for distribution among our shareholders are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess will be distributed at equal ranking among those shareholders in proportion to the amount paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the shares held by them, respectively and (ii) if we are wound up and the assets available for distribution among the shareholders as such are insufficient to repay

186

Table of Contents

the whole of the paid-up capital, those assets will be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses will be borne by the shareholders in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of liquidation.
 
If we are wound up, the liquidator may with the sanction of our special resolution and any other sanction required by the Companies Law, divide among our shareholders in specie or kind the whole or any part of our assets (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may, for such purpose, set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the shareholders as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no shareholder shall be compelled to accept any assets, shares or other securities upon which there is a liability.
 
Modification of Rights
 
Except with respect to alteration of share capital as described below, alterations to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be made by special resolution of no less than two-thirds of votes cast at a meeting of our shareholders.
 
Subject to the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands and our amended and restated articles of association, any shares of a class may be issued with or attached with special rights or restrictions, including the right to be redeemed at the option of us or the holder of such shares as the board may determine; provided that once the shares of such class are issued, any variation of rights or restrictions applicable to the shares of such class will require a special resolution of not less that two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of the shares of such class. The provisions of our amended and restated articles of association relating to general meetings shall apply similarly to every such separate general meeting, but so that (i) the quorum shall be a person or persons together holding (or represented by proxy) not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of that class; (ii) every holder of shares of the class shall be entitled on a poll to one vote for every such share held by such holder; and (iii) any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy or authorized representative may demand a poll.
 
The special rights conferred upon the holders of any class of shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of such shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking equally therewith.
 
Our existing authorized ordinary shares confer on the holders of our ordinary shares equal rights, privileges and restrictions. The shareholders have, by virtue of adoption of our third amended and restated articles of association, authorized the issuance of ordinary shares of par value of US$0.01 each without specifying any special rights, privileges and restrictions. Therefore, our board of directors may, without further action by our shareholders, issue shares of such class and attach to such shares special rights, privileges or restrictions, which may be different from those associated with our ordinary shares. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. The ordinary shares underlying the ADSs in our issued and outstanding share capital have not been issued on the express terms that they are redeemable. However, our board of directors may pass resolutions to allow us to redeem the ordinary shares from the holders, and two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of the ordinary shares may approve such variation of share rights. The minority shareholders will not be able to prevent their share rights being varied in such a way and their ordinary shares could become redeemable by us as a result.

Table of Contents

Alteration of Capital
 
We may from time to time by ordinary resolution:
 
 	• 	increase our capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such amounts, as the resolution shall prescribe;
 
 	• 	consolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into shares of larger amount than our existing shares;
 
 	• 	divide our shares into several classes and without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of existing shares, attach to these shares any preferential or special rights, privileges or restrictions, provided that after the shareholders authorize a class of shares without any special rights, privileges or restrictions, our board of directors may, without further resolution of the shareholders, issue shares of such class and attach such rights, privileges or restrictions, and following such issuance of the shares of such class, a two-thirds vote of such class of shares will be required to further vary the special rights, privileges or restrictions attached to such class of shares;
 
 	• 	sub-divide our shares into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by our memorandum and articles of association, subject to the Companies Law and may determine that, among the shares so sub-divided, some of such shares may have preferred or other rights or restrictions that are different from those applicable to the other such shares resulting from the sub-division; and
 
 	• 	cancel any shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the amount of our share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.
 
We may, by special resolution, subject to any confirmation or consent required by the Companies Law, reduce our share capital, or any capital redemption reserve in any manner authorized by law.
 
Transfer of Shares
 
Subject to such of the restrictions of our amended and restated articles of association, any of our shareholder may transfer all or any of his or her shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or in or such other form prescribed by the NYSE or in any other form which the directors may approve. Our directors may decline to register any transfer of any share which is not paid up or on which we have a lien. Our directors may also decline to register any transfer of any share unless:
 
(a) the instrument of transfer is lodged with us accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
 
(b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share;
 
(c) the instrument of transfer is properly stamped (in circumstances where stamping is required);
 
(d) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the share is to be transferred does not exceed four;
 
(e) a fee, if any, of such maximum sum as the NYSE may determine to be payable or such lesser sum as the directors may from time to time require is paid to us in respect thereof.
 
If the directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.

188

Table of Contents

The registration of transfers may, on notice being given by advertisement in such one or more newspapers or by other means in accordance with the requirements of the NYSE, be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as the directors may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year as our directors may determine.
 
Share Repurchase
 
We are empowered by the Companies Law and our amended and restated articles of association to purchase our own shares subject to certain restrictions. Our directors may only exercise this power on our behalf, subject to the Companies Law, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and to any applicable requirements imposed from time to time by the SEC, the NYSE or by any other recognized stock exchange on which our securities are listed.
 
Dividends
 
Subject to the Companies Law, we may declare dividends in any currency to be paid to our shareholders but no dividends shall exceed the amount recommended by our directors. Dividends may be declared and paid out of our profits, realized or unrealized, or from any reserve set aside from profits which our directors determine is no longer needed. Our board of directors may also declare and pay dividends out of the share premium account or any other fund or account which can be authorized for this purpose in accordance with the Companies Law.
 
Except in so far as the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of, any share otherwise provides (i) all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares in respect of which the dividend is paid, but no amount paid up on a share in advance of calls shall be treated for this purpose as paid up on that share; and (ii) all dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid upon the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid.
 
Our directors may also pay any interim dividend which is payable on any shares semi-annually or on any other dates, whenever our profits, in the opinion of the directors, justify such payment.
 
Our directors may deduct from any dividend or bonus payable to any shareholder all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to us on account of calls, installments or otherwise.
 
No dividend or other monies payable by us on or in respect of any share shall bear interest against us.
 
In respect of any dividend proposed to be paid or declared on our share capital, our directors may resolve and direct that; (i) such dividend be satisfied wholly or in part in the form of an allotment of shares credited as fully paid up, provided that our shareholders entitled thereto will be entitled to elect to receive such dividend (or part thereof if our directors so determine) in cash in lieu of such allotment; or (ii) that the shareholders entitled to such dividend will be entitled to elect to receive an allotment of shares credited as fully paid up in lieu of the whole or such part of the dividend as the directors may think fit. We may also, on the recommendation of our directors, resolve in respect of any particular dividend that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it may be satisfied wholly in the form of an allotment of shares credited as fully paid up without offering any right of shareholders to elect to receive such dividend in cash in lieu of such allotment.
 
Any dividend interest or other sum payable in cash to the holder of shares may be paid by check or warrant sent by mail addressed to the holder at his registered address, or addressed to such person and at such addresses as the holder may direct. Every such check or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders otherwise direct, be made payable to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first on the register in respect of such

189

Table of Contents

shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the check or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to us.
 
All dividends unclaimed for one year after having been declared may be invested or otherwise made use of by our board of directors for the benefit of our company until claimed. Any dividend unclaimed after a period of six years from the date of declaration of such dividend may be forfeited by our board of directors and, if so forfeited, shall revert to us.
 
Whenever our directors or the shareholders in general meeting have resolved that a dividend be paid or declared, the directors may further resolve that such dividend be satisfied by direct payment or satisfaction wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets of any kind, and in particular of paid up shares, debentures or warrants to subscribe for our securities or securities of any other company. Where any difficulty arises with regard to such distribution, our directors may settle it as they think expedient. In particular our directors may issue fractional certificates or authorize any person to sell and transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions altogether, and may fix the value for distribution purposes of any such specific assets and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any of our shareholders upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of the parties, vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the directors and appoint any person to sign any requisite instruments of transfer and other documents on behalf of a person entitled to the dividend, which appointment shall be effective and binding on our shareholders.
 
Untraceable Shareholders
 
We are entitled to sell any share of a shareholder who is untraceable, provided that:
 
(i) all checks or warrants in respect of dividends of such shares, not being less than three in number, for any sums payable in cash to the holder of such shares have remained uncashed for a period of 12 years prior to the publication of the advertisement and during the three months referred to in paragraph (3) below;
 
(ii) we have not during that time received any indication of the whereabouts or existence of the shareholder or person entitled to such shares by death, bankruptcy or operation of law; and
 
(iii) we have caused an advertisement to be published in newspapers in the manner stipulated by our amended and restated articles of association, giving notice of our intention to sell these shares, and a period of three months has elapsed since such advertisement and NYSE has been notified of such intention.
 
The net proceeds of any such sale shall belong to us and when we receive these net proceeds we shall become indebted to the former shareholder for an amount equal to such net proceeds.
 
Board of Directors
 
General
 
We are managed by a board of directors which must consist of not less than two members. Any director on our board may be removed by way of an ordinary resolution of shareholders. Any vacancies on our board of directors or additions to the existing board of directors can be filled by way of an ordinary resolution of shareholders or by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the remaining directors. The directors may at any time appoint any person as a director to fill a vacancy or as an addition to the existing board, but any director so appointed by the board of directors shall hold office only until the next following annual general meeting of our Company and shall then be eligible for re-election. Other than the chairperson of our board or any managing director who are not required to retire, one-third of the rest of our directors who were appointed by shareholders at a general meeting are subject to retirement from office by rotation at each general meeting. All our directors who were appointed by our board must retire at the next annual general meeting. Retiring directors are eligible for re-election.

190

Table of Contents

Meetings of the board of directors may be convened at any time deemed necessary by any members of the board of directors.
 
A meeting of the board of directors will be competent to make lawful and binding decisions if any two members of the board of directors are present or represented. At any meeting of the directors, each director, be it by his presence or by his alternate, is entitled to one vote.
 
Questions arising at a meeting of the board of directors are required to be decided by simple majority votes of the members of the board of directors present or represented at the meeting. In the case of a tie vote, the chairperson of the meeting shall have a second or deciding vote. Our board of directors may also pass resolutions without a meeting by unanimous written consent.
 
Borrowing Powers
 
Our directors may exercise all the powers to raise or borrow money, to mortgage or charge all or any part of our undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital and, subject to the Companies Law, to issue debentures, bonds and other securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of ours or of any third party.
 
Inspection of Books and Records
 
Holders of our shares will have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records. However, we will provide our shareholders with annual audited financial statements. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information”.
 
Exempted Company
 
We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies Law in the Cayman Islands distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company except for the exemptions and privileges listed below:
 
 	• 	an exempted company does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies;
 
 	• 	an exempted company’s register of members is not open to inspection;
 
 	• 	an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting;
 
 	• 	an exempted company may issue no par value, negotiable or bearer shares;
 
 	• 	an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance);
 
 	• 	an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands;
 
 	• 	an exempted company may register as a limited duration company; and
 
 	• 	an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company.
 
“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on our shares. We are subject to reporting and other informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as applicable to foreign private issuers. We currently intend to comply with the NYSE rules, in lieu of following home country practice. The NYSE rules require that every company listed on the NYSE hold an annual general meeting of shareholders. In addition, our third amended and restated articles of association allows directors or shareholders holding not less than 50% of the voting power at shareholder meetings to call special shareholder

meetings pursuant to the procedures set forth in the articles. We believe that the differences with respect to being a Cayman Islands exempted company as opposed to a Delaware corporation do not pose additional material risks to investors, other than the risks described under “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our ADSs and the ADS Offering”.
 
Differences in Corporate Law
 
The Companies Law is modeled after similar law in England but does not necessarily always follow recent changes in English law. In addition, the Companies Law differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.
 
Mergers and Similar Arrangements
 
Cayman Islands law does not provide for mergers as that expression is understood under United States corporate law. However, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:
 
 	• 	the Company is not proposing to act illegally or beyond its power and the statutory provisions as to the due majority vote have been complied with;
 
 	• 	the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;
 
 	• 	the arrangement is such that a businessman would reasonably approve; and
 
 	• 	the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law or that would amount to a “fraud on minority”.
 
When a take-over offer is made and accepted by holders of 90.0% of the shares (within four months), the offeror may, within a two month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith, collusion or a breach of the Companies Law.
 
If the arrangement and reconstruction or takeover offer is thus approved or accepted, the dissenting shareholder are unlikely to have any rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of United States corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares.
 
Shareholders’ Suits
 
We are not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court. In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and a derivative action may not normally be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would likely be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, there are exceptions to the foregoing principle, including when:
 
 	• 	a company acts or proposes to act illegally or beyond its power;

192

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	the act complained of, although not beyond the power of the company, could be effected only if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not been obtained; and
 
 	• 	those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority”.
 
Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability
 
Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers, directors and auditors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such unless such losses or damages arise from dishonesty, fraud or default of such directors or officers or auditors. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.
 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable as a matter of United States law.
 
Anti-takeover Provisions in the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
 
Cayman Islands law does not prevent companies from adopting a wide range of defensive measures, such as staggered boards, blank check preferred shares, removal of directors only for cause and provisions that restrict the rights of shareholders to call meetings, act by written consent and submit shareholder proposals. Our amended memorandum and articles of incorporation provide for, among others, a staggered board, blank check preferred stock and provisions that restrict the rights of shareholders to call shareholders’ meetings and eliminate their right to act by written consent.
 
Directors’ Fiduciary Duties
 
Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.
 
Under Cayman Islands law, at common law, members of a board of directors owe a fiduciary duty to the company to act in good faith in their dealings with or on behalf of the company and

193

Table of Contents

exercise their powers and fulfill the duties of their office honestly. This duty has four essential elements:
 
 	• 	a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company;
 
 	• 	a duty not to personally profit from opportunities that arise from the office of director;
 
 	• 	a duty to avoid conflicts of interest; and
 
 	• 	a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were intended.
 
In general, the Companies Law imposes various duties on officers of a company with respect to certain matters of management and administration of the company. The Companies Law contains provisions, which impose default fines on persons who fail to satisfy those requirements. However, in many circumstances, an individual is only liable if he knowingly is guilty of the default or knowingly and willfully authorizes or permits the default.
 
Shareholder Action by Written Consent
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation. The Companies Law allows a special resolution to be passed in writing if signed by all the shareholders and authorized by the articles of association.
 
Shareholder Proposals
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.
 
The Companies Law does not provide shareholders any right to bring business before a meeting or requisition a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in articles of association. Our amended and restated articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than 50% of our paid-up voting share capital to requisition a shareholder’s meeting. As an exempted Cayman Islands company, we are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings. However, our amended and restated articles of association require us to call such meetings.
 
Cumulative Voting
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. While there is nothing under the Cayman Islands law which specifically prohibits or restricts the creation of cumulative voting rights for the election of directors of a Company, our amended and restated articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.
 
Removal of Directors
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our amended and restated articles of association, directors may be removed, by way of ordinary resolution of the shareholders.

Transactions with Interested Shareholders
 
The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting stock within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware public corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.
 
A Cayman company may enter into some business transactions with significant shareholders, including asset sales, in which a significant shareholder receives, or could receive, a financial benefit that is greater than that received, or to be received, by other shareholders with prior approval from the board of directors but without prior approval from the shareholders.
 
Sale of Assets
 
Contrary to the general practice in most corporations incorporated in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not require that shareholders approve sales of all or substantially all of a company’s assets.
 
Dissolution; Winding up
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands and our amended and restated articles of association, our company may be dissolved, liquidated or wound up by the vote of holders of two-thirds of our shares voting at a meeting.
 
Variation of Rights of Shares
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman Islands law, our amended and restated articles of association provides that, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any class only with the vote at a class meeting of holders of two-thirds of the shares of such class.
 
Amendment of Governing Documents
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman Islands law, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended with the vote of holders of two-thirds of our shares voting at a meeting.

Rights of Non-resident or Foreign Shareholders
 
There are no limitations imposed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.
 
Rights Plan
 
On October 17, 2007, our board of directors authorized the distribution of one ordinary share purchase right, which we refer to as the purchase right, for each ordinary share of the Company as of the close of business on October 26, 2007. The distribution was made on October 26, 2007, to the shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 26, 2007, or the rights record date. The purchase rights will become exercisable only if a person or group obtains ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s ordinary shares (including by acquisition of our ADSs) or enters into an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors, at which time the holders of the purchase rights (other than the acquiring person or group) will be entitled to purchase from us our ordinary shares at half of the market price at the time of purchase. In the event of a subsequent acquisition of the Company, the holders (other than the acquiring person or group) may be entitled to buy ordinary shares of the acquiring entity half price. The exercise price which we refer to as the rights purchase price, is US$95.00 per purchase right, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the purchase rights are set forth in a rights agreement dated as of October 17, 2007, which we refer to as the rights plan, between the Company and RBC Dexia Corporate Services Hong Kong Limited, as rights agent.
 
Under the rights plan, Tianwei Baobian will be permitted to purchase our ordinary shares (i) pursuant to its subscription rights under the joint venture contract, as amended, and (ii) from Yingli Power, in each case without triggering the exercisability of the purchase rights.
 
Until the close of business on the earlier of (i) the tenth day after the first date of a public announcement that a person (other than an exempted entity as defined in the rights plan, or an exempted entity) or group of affiliated or associated persons, which we refer to as an acquiring person, has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our ordinary shares then outstanding or (ii) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of our board of directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an acquiring person) after the date of commencement of, or the first public announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person (other than an exempted entity) or group of 15% or more of our ordinary shares then outstanding (the earlier of such dates being referred to as the distribution date), the purchase rights will be evidenced by the ordinary shares represented by certificates for ordinary shares outstanding as of the rights record date, together with a copy of the summary of rights disseminated in connection with the original distribution of the purchase rights.
 
As defined in the rights plan, “exempted entity” means (i) the Company, (ii) any subsidiary of the Company, (iii) any entity or trustee holding our ordinary shares for or pursuant to the terms of any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company or for the purpose of funding any such plan or funding other employee benefits for employees of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company, (iv) any Yingli Power entity for so long as it beneficially owns no more than 46.42%, and no less than 15%, of our outstanding ordinary shares; and (v) any Tianwei Baobian entity with respect to our ordinary shares Tianwei Baobian may obtain pursuant to its subscription right or from a Yingli Power entity for so long as the Tianwei Baobian entity beneficially owns no more than 26.78%, and no less than 15% (in each case excluding any ordinary shares as to which it acquires beneficial ownership from a Yingli Power entity), of our outstanding ordinary shares.

196

Table of Contents

The rights plan provides that, until the distribution date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the purchase rights), the purchase rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of ordinary shares. The purchase rights are not exercisable until the distribution date. The purchase rights will expire on October 17, 2017 unless extended or unless the purchase rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by us as described below.
 
In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a purchase right, other than purchase rights beneficially owned by the acquiring person (which will thereupon become void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a purchase right and payment of the rights purchase price, the number of our ordinary shares having a market value of two times the rights purchase price.
 
In the event that, after a person or group has become an acquiring person, we are acquired in a amalgamation, merger, scheme of arrangement or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a purchase right (other than purchase rights beneficially owned by an acquiring person which will have become void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then-current exercise price of the purchase right, the number of ordinary shares of the person with whom we have engaged in the foregoing transaction (or its parent) having a market value of two times the then-current rights purchase price at the time of such transaction.
 
At any time after any person or group becomes an acquiring person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of our outstanding ordinary shares or the occurrence of an event described in the prior paragraph, our board of directors may exchange the purchase rights (other than purchase rights owned by such person or group which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one ordinary share per purchase right (subject to adjustment).
 
The rights purchase price payable and the number of ordinary shares or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the purchase rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution. With certain exceptions, no adjustment in rights purchase price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such rights purchase price. No fractional ordinary shares will be issued; in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of our ordinary shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
 
At any time prior to the time an acquiring person becomes such, our board of directors may redeem the purchase rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of US$0.01 per purchase right, which we refer to as the rights redemption price. The redemption of the purchase rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as our board of directors in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the purchase rights, the right to exercise the purchase rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of purchase rights will be to receive the right redemption price.
 
For so long as the purchase rights are then redeemable, we may, except with respect to the rights redemption price, amend the rights plan in any manner. After the purchase rights are no longer redeemable, we may, except with respect to the rights redemption price, amend the rights plan in any manner that does not adversely affect the interests of holders of the purchase rights.
 
Until a purchase right is exercised or exchanged, the holder of such purchase right will have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

Ordinary Shares
 
On August 7, 2006, we issued a total of 50,000,000 ordinary shares to Yingli Power in connection with our incorporation for an aggregate subscription amount of US$500,000. On September 25, 2006, we issued an additional 9,800,000 ordinary shares to Yingli Power as our sole shareholder for an aggregate subscription amount of US$100,000.
 
Series A Preferred Shares and a Warrant
 
On September 29, 2006, we issued to Inspiration Partners Limited 8,081,081 Series A preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of US$17.0 million, or at US$2.10 per share. On September 28, 2006, we also issued to TB Management Ltd., affiliate of Inspiration Partners Limited, a warrant to purchase 678,811 of our ordinary shares for no consideration, which was subsequently transferred to its affiliate, Fairdeal Development Ltd., and which was exercised on May 23, 2007. All outstanding Series A preferred shares were automatically converted into our ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007 at a conversion ratio of one-to-one. The proceeds from the issuance of the Series A preferred shares and the warrant were used to finance the transfer of the 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli that was held by Yingli Group to us.
 
Series B Preferred Shares and Warrants
 
During the period from December 20, 2006 to January 13, 2007, we issued to Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, an affiliate of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, and 13 other investors, including J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., a total of 24,405,377 Series B preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of US$118 million, or at US$4.835 per share. In addition, during the same period, we granted to such investors, other than the three investors who had made advance payments, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,112,057 of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$0.01 per share. In addition, on or about March 27, 2007, we further issued to the Series B preferred shareholders (other than the three investors who had made advance payments) additional warrants with terms similar to the previously issued Series B warrants to purchase an aggregate of 688,090 of our ordinary shares in exchange for the early termination of an escrow arrangement with certain restriction, which made the release of a portion of the proceeds in an amount of US$19.6 million, that were received from the issuance and sale of the Series B preferred shares contingent upon our obtaining the relevant PRC regulatory approvals and completion of related procedural formalities in connection with the conversion of the shareholder loan into equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Under an agreement dated May 21, 2007 among us, Yingli Power, Mr. Liansheng Miao and Baytree Investments, the lead Series B preferred shareholder, all of the warrants issued to the Series B preferred shareholders were rendered not exercisable in light of the substantial progress in the relevant PRC regulatory approval process related to the shareholder loan. This amount of US$19.6 million was injected into Tianwei Yingli upon removal of such restriction in the form of entrusted loan from us to satisfy Tianwei Yingli’s working capital requirement. Of US$118 million in aggregate proceeds, US$17 million, which was received as advance payments for the purchase of Series B preferred shares from us, was used to increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 53.98% from 51%, US$22.6 million (together with US$17 million from portions of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of the mandatory redeemable bonds and the mandatory convertible bonds) was injected into Tianwei Yingli in the form of a direct equity contribution upon completion of relevant PRC registration procedures, and the remaining US$78.4 million was injected into Tianwei Yingli in the form of a shareholder loan from us to Tianwei Yingli which was converted into equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Upon the completion of relevant PRC registration procedures for the direct equity contribution and obtaining the approval from the SAFE, Baoding Branch for the conversion of the shareholder loan into an equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, which resulted in the additional equity contribution of an aggregate amount of US$118 million to Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital, our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli increased to 70.11% from 62.13%. All outstanding Series B preferred

Table of Contents

shares were automatically converted into our ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007 at a conversion ratio of one-to-one.
 
Mandatory Convertible Bonds and Mandatory Redeemable Bonds
 
On November 13, 2006, we issued interest-bearing mandatory redeemable bonds and mandatory convertible bonds to Yingli Power in the aggregate principal amount of US$85 million and at an issue price equal to 98.75% of such aggregate principal amount. The mandatory redeemable bonds in the principal amount of US$38 million were required to be redeemed at their principal amount upon the completion of our initial public offering. The mandatory convertible bonds with the principal amount of US$47 million were required to be converted into equity interests in us at an aggregate value equal to the value of a 3.73% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli upon the completion of our initial offering. The net proceeds from these bonds must be used (i) up to US$62 million, to increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli from 53.98% to 62.13% (which event occurred on December 18, 2006), (ii) up to US$17 million, to further increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, (iii) US$4.5 million to be held in a restricted account to be used to service the first three payments falling due under these bonds and (iv) the remaining proceeds for general corporate purpose and working capital. Upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007, we redeemed the mandatory redeemable bonds and issued 5,340,088 of our ordinary shares to Yingli Power upon conversion of the mandatory convertible bonds.
 
Other Securities Issuance
 
On December 29, 2006, we issued to China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd., an investment holding company established in the British Virgin Islands, a warrant to purchase 2,068,252 of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$4.835 per share in connection with the repayment and termination of a convertible loan made to Tianwei Yingli on May 17, 2006. China Sunshine Investment Co. Ltd. exercised this warrant in full on February 6, 2007.
 
Share Options and Restricted Shares
 
We adopted the 2006 stock incentive plan in December 2006. We granted options to purchase an aggregate of 610,929 ordinary shares to four executive officers of us in December 2006. In January and April 2007, we granted to DBS Trustees Limited an aggregate of 2,621,060 restricted shares to be held in trust for the benefit of 70 trust participants consisting of nine directors and executive officers of us and Tianwei Yingli and 60 other employees of us and Tianwei Yingli and one non-employee. Upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 115,000 ordinary shares to three independent directors and one key employee at an exercise price of US$11.00 per share. In July 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 35,000 ordinary shares to two key employees at an exercise price of US$11.00 per share and US$12.89 per share, respectively. In September 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 125,700 ordinary shares to one executive officer at an exercise price of US$18.48 per share. In December 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 540,000 ordinary shares to one executive officer and one new employee at an exercise price of US$28.30 per share. As of the date of this prospectus, options to purchase 1,426,629 ordinary shares of our company were outstanding. See “Management — 2006 Stock Incentive Plan”.
 
Registration Rights
 
Under the terms of an amended shareholders agreement with our Series A and Series B preferred shareholders, at any time six months after the closing of our initial public offering, any shareholder(s) holding of record at least 33% of registrable securities then outstanding may, on three occasions only, request us to effect the registration, on a form other than Form F-3, of all or part of the registrable securities then outstanding. Registrable securities are ordinary shares issued or

199

Table of Contents

issuable to the holders of our preferred shares or their respective transferees or the holders or transferees of the warrants issued by us.
 
In addition, upon our company becoming eligible for using Form F-3, any holder of registrable securities may request us to effect a registration statement on Form F-3 for a public offering of registrable securities so long as the reasonably anticipated aggregate price to the public (net of selling expenses) would be at least US$5.0 million and we are entitled to use Form F-3 (or a comparable form) for such offering. Holders of registrable securities may demand a registration on Form F-3 on unlimited occasions, although we are not obligated to effect more than one such registration in any 12-month period. Under certain circumstances, such demand registration may also include ordinary shares other than registrable securities.
 
Holders of registrable securities also have “piggyback” registration rights, which may request us to register all or any part of the registrable securities then held by such holders when we register any of our ordinary shares. If any of the offerings involves an underwriting, the managing underwriter of any such offering has certain rights to limit the number of shares included in such registration. However, the number of registrable securities included in an underwritten public offering subsequent to our initial public offering pursuant to “piggyback” registration rights may not be reduced to less than 35% of the aggregate securities included in such offering. However, the terms of the amended shareholders agreement do not provide for any specific damage, payment or transfer any other consideration to the Series A and B preferred shareholders in the event of non-performance to effect a registration statement.
 
We are generally required to bear all of the registration expenses incurred in connection with three demand registrations, unlimited Form F-3 and piggyback registrations, except underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
Holders of our warrants are also entitled to the same registration rights as described above with respect to the ordinary shares into which their warrants are exercisable.

DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES
 
American Depositary Receipts
 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as depositary, issues the ADSs which you will be entitled to receive in this offering. Each ADS represents an ownership interest in one ordinary share which we will deposit with the custodian, as agent of the depositary, under the deposit agreement among us, the depositary and you as an ADR holder. In the future, each ADS will also represent any securities, cash or other property deposited with the depositary but which it has not distributed directly to you. Unless specifically requested by you, all ADSs will be issued on the books of our depositary in book-entry form and periodic statements will be mailed to you which reflect your ownership interest in such ADSs. In our description, references to American depositary receipts or ADRs shall include the statements you will receive which reflects your ownership of ADSs.
 
The depositary’s office is located at 4 New York Plaza, New York, NY 10004. J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., one of our shareholders, is an affiliate of the depositary.
 
You may hold ADSs either directly or indirectly through your broker or other financial institution. If you hold ADSs directly, by having an ADS registered in your name on the books of the depositary, you are an ADR holder. This description assumes you hold your ADSs directly. If you hold the ADSs through your broker or financial institution nominee, you must rely on the procedures of such broker or financial institution to assert the rights of an ADR holder described in this section. You should consult with your broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are.
 
As an ADR holder, we will not treat you as a shareholder of ours and you will not have any shareholder rights. Cayman Island law governs shareholder rights. Because the depositary or its nominee will be the shareholder of record for the shares represented by all outstanding ADSs, shareholder rights rest with such record holder. Your rights are those of an ADR holder. Such rights derive from the terms of the deposit agreement to be entered into among us, the depositary and all registered holders from time to time of ADSs issued under the deposit agreement. The obligations of the depositary and its agents are also set out in the deposit agreement. Because the depositary or its nominee will actually be the registered owner of the shares, you must rely on it to exercise the rights of a shareholder on your behalf. The deposit agreement and the ADSs are governed by New York law.
 
The following is a summary of the material terms of the deposit agreement. For more complete information, you should read the entire deposit agreement and the form of ADR which contains the terms of your ADSs. You can read a copy of the deposit agreement which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. You may also obtain a copy of the deposit agreement at the SEC’s public reference room which is located at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the SEC at 1-800-732-0330. You may also find the registration statement and the attached deposit agreement from the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
 
Share Dividends and Other Distributions
 
How will you Receive Dividends and Other Distributions on the Shares Underlying your ADSs?
 
We may make various types of distributions with respect to our securities. The depositary has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on shares or other deposited securities, after converting any cash received into U.S. dollars and, in all cases, making any necessary deductions provided for in the deposit agreement. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of underlying securities that your ADSs represent.

201

Table of Contents

Except as stated below, to the extent the depositary is legally permitted, it will deliver such distributions to ADR holders in proportion to their interests in the following manner:
 
 	• 	Cash.  The depositary will distribute any U.S. dollars available to it resulting from a cash dividend or other cash distribution or the net proceeds of sales of any other distribution or portion thereof (to the extent applicable), on an averaged or other practicable basis, subject to (i) appropriate adjustments for taxes withheld, (ii) such distribution being impermissible or impracticable with respect to certain registered holders, and (iii) deduction of the depositary’s expenses in (1) converting any foreign currency to U.S. dollars to the extent that it determines that such conversion may be made on a reasonable basis, (2) transferring foreign currency or U.S. dollars to the United States by such means as the depositary may determine to the extent that it determines that such transfer may be made on a reasonable basis, (3) obtaining any approval or license of any governmental authority required for such conversion or transfer, which is obtainable at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable time and (4) making any sale by public or private means in any commercially reasonable manner. If exchange rates fluctuate during a time when the depositary cannot convert a foreign currency, you may lose some or all of the value of the distribution.
 
 	• 	Shares.  In the case of a distribution in shares, the depositary will issue additional ADRs to evidence the number of ADSs representing such shares. Only whole ADSs will be issued. Any shares which would result in fractional ADSs will be sold and the net proceeds will be distributed in the same manner as cash to the ADR holders entitled thereto.
 
 	• 	Rights to Receive Additional Shares.  In the case of a distribution of rights to subscribe for additional shares or other rights, if we provide satisfactory evidence that the depositary may lawfully distribute such rights, the depositary will distribute warrants or other instruments representing such rights. However, if we do not furnish such evidence, the depositary may:
 
 	• 	sell such rights if practicable and distribute the net proceeds as cash; or
 
 	• 	if it is not practicable to sell such rights, do nothing and allow such rights to lapse, in which case ADR holders will receive nothing.
 
We have no obligation to file a registration statement under the Securities Act in order to make any rights available to ADR holders.
 
 	• 	Other Distributions.  In the case of a distribution of securities or property other than those described above, the depositary may either (i) distribute such securities or property in any manner it deems equitable and practicable or (ii) to the extent the depositary deems distribution of such securities or property not to be equitable and practicable, sell such securities or property and distribute any net proceeds in the same way it distributes cash.
 
If the depositary determines that any distribution described above is not practicable with respect to any specific ADR holder, the depositary may choose any practicable method of distribution for such ADR holder, including the distribution of foreign currency, securities or property, or it may retain such items, without paying interest on or investing them, on behalf of the ADR holder as deposited securities, in which case the ADSs will also represent the retained items.
 
Any U.S. dollars will be distributed by checks drawn on a bank in the United States for whole dollars and cents. Fractional cents will be withheld without liability for interest thereon and dealt with by the depositary in accordance with its then current practices.
 
The depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any ADR holders.
 
There can be no assurance that the depositary will be able to convert any currency at a specified exchange rate or sell any property, rights, shares or other securities at a specified price, nor that any of such transactions can be completed within a specified time period.

Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation
 
How does the Depositary Issue ADSs?
 
The depositary will issue ADSs if you or your broker deposits shares or evidence of rights to receive shares with the custodian and pay the fees and expenses owing to the depositary in connection with such issuance. In the case of the ADSs to be issued under this prospectus, we will arrange with the underwriters named herein to deposit such shares.
 
Shares deposited in the future with the custodian must be accompanied by certain delivery documentation, including instruments showing that such shares have been properly transferred or endorsed to the person on whose behalf the deposit is being made.
 
The custodian will hold all deposited shares (including those being deposited by or on our behalf in connection with the offering to which this prospectus relates) for the account of the depositary. ADR holders thus have no direct ownership interest in the shares and only have such rights as are contained in the deposit agreement. The custodian will also hold any additional securities, property and cash received on or in substitution for the deposited shares. The deposited shares and any such additional items are referred to as “deposited securities”.
 
Upon each deposit of shares, receipt of related delivery documentation and compliance with the other provisions of the deposit agreement, including the payment of the fees and charges of the depositary and any taxes or other fees or charges owing, the depositary will issue an ADR or ADRs in the name or upon the order of the person entitled thereto evidencing the number of ADSs to which such person is entitled. All of the ADSs issued will, unless specifically requested to the contrary, be part of the depositary’s direct registration system, and a registered holder will receive periodic statements from the depositary which will show the number of ADSs registered in such holder’s name. An ADR holder can request that the ADSs not be held through the depositary’s direct registration system and that a certificated ADR be issued.
 
How do ADR Holders Cancel an ADS and Obtain Deposited Securities?
 
When you turn in your ADSs at the depositary’s office, or when you provide proper instructions and documentation in the case of direct registration ADSs, the depositary will, upon payment of certain applicable fees, charges and taxes, deliver the underlying shares at the custodian’s office or effect delivery by such other means as the depositary deems practicable, including transfer to an account of an accredited financial institution on your behalf. At your risk, expense and request, the depositary may deliver deposited securities at such other place as you may request.
 
The depositary may only restrict the withdrawal of deposited securities in connection with:
 
 	• 	temporary delays caused by closing our transfer books or those of the depositary or the deposit of shares in connection with voting at a shareholders’ meeting, or the payment of dividends;
 
 	• 	the payment of fees, taxes and similar charges; or
 
 	• 	compliance with any U.S. or foreign laws or governmental regulations relating to the ADRs or to the withdrawal of deposited securities.
 
This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision of the deposit agreement.
 
Record Dates
 
The Depositary may Fix Record Dates for the Determination of the ADR Holders who will be Entitled (or Obligated, as the Case may be):
 
 	• 	to receive a dividend, distribution or rights,
 
 	• 	to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at a meeting of holders of ordinary shares or other deposited securities, or

203

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	for the determination of the registered holders who shall be responsible for the fee assessed by the depositary for administration of the ADR program and for any expenses as provided for in the ADR,
 
 	• 	to receive any notice or to act in respect of other matters,
 
 	• 	all subject to the provisions of the deposit agreement.
 
Voting Rights
 
How do you vote?
 
If you are an ADR holder and the depositary asks you to provide it with voting instructions, you may instruct the depositary how to exercise the voting rights for the shares which underlie your ADSs. After receiving voting materials from us, the depositary will notify the ADR holders of any shareholder meeting or solicitation of consents or proxies. This notice will state such information as contained in the voting materials and describe how you may instruct the depositary to exercise the voting rights for the shares which underlie your ADSs and will include instructions for giving a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us. For instructions to be valid, the depositary must receive them in the manner and on or before the date specified. The depositary will try, as far as is practical, subject to the provisions of and governing the underlying shares or other deposited securities, to vote or to have its agents vote the shares or other deposited securities as you instruct. The depositary will only vote or attempt to vote as you instruct. The depositary will not itself exercise any voting discretion. Furthermore, neither the depositary nor its agents are responsible for any failure to carry out any voting instructions, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any vote.
 
There is no guarantee that you will receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote and it is possible that you, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.
 
Reports and Other Communications
 
Will you be able to view our reports?
 
The depositary will make available for inspection by ADR holders any written communications from us which are both received by the custodian or its nominee as a holder of deposited securities and made generally available to the holders of deposited securities. We will furnish these communications in English when so required by any rules or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Additionally, if we make any written communications generally available to holders of our shares, including the depositary or the custodian, and we request the depositary to provide them to ADR holders, the depositary will mail copies of them, or, at its option, English translations or summaries of them to ADR holders.
 
Fees and Expenses
 
What Fees and Expenses will you be Responsible for Paying?
 
ADR holders will be charged a fee for each issuance of ADSs, including issuances resulting from distributions of shares, rights and other property, and for each surrender of ADSs in exchange for deposited securities. The fee in each case is US$5.00 for each 100 ADSs (or any portion thereof) issued or surrendered.
 
The following additional charges shall be incurred by the ADR holders, by any party depositing or withdrawing shares or by any party surrendering ADRs or to whom ADRs are issued (including, without limitation, issuance pursuant to a stock dividend or stock split declared by the Company or an

204

Table of Contents

exchange of stock regarding the ADRs or the deposited securities or a distribution of ADRs), whichever is applicable:
 
 	• 	to the extent not prohibited by the rules of any stock exchange or interdealer quotation system upon which the ADSs are traded, a fee of US$1.50 per ADR or ADRs for transfers of certificated or direct registration ADRs;
 
 	• 	a fee of US$0.02 or less per ADS (or portion thereof) for any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement;
 
 	• 	a fee of US$0.04 per ADS (or portion thereof) per calendar year for services performed by the depositary in administering our ADR program (which fee may be charged on a periodic basis during each calendar year (with the aggregate of such fees not to exceed the amount set forth above) and shall be assessed against holders of ADRs as of the record date or record dates set by the depositary during each calendar year and shall be payable in the manner described in the next succeeding provision);
 
 	• 	any other charge payable by any of the depositary, any of the depositary’s agents, including, without limitation, the custodian, or the agents of the depositary’s agents in connection with the servicing of our shares or other deposited securities (which charge shall be assessed against registered holders of our ADRs as of the record date or dates set by the depositary and shall be payable at the sole discretion of the depositary by billing such registered holders or by deducting such charge from one or more cash dividends or other cash distributions);
 
 	• 	a fee for the distribution of securities (or the sale of securities in connection with a distribution), such fee being in an amount equal to the fee for the execution and delivery of ADSs which would have been charged as a result of the deposit of such securities (treating all such securities as if they were shares) but which securities or the net cash proceeds from the sale thereof are instead distributed by the depositary to those holders entitled thereto;
 
 	• 	stock transfer or other taxes and other governmental charges;
 
 	• 	cable, telex and facsimile transmission and delivery charges incurred at your request;
 
 	• 	transfer or registration fees for the registration of transfer of deposited securities on any applicable register in connection with the deposit or withdrawal of deposited securities;
 
 	• 	expenses of the depositary in connection with the conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars; and
 
 	• 	such fees and expenses as are incurred by the depositary (including without limitation expenses incurred in connection with compliance with foreign exchange control regulations or any law or regulation relating to foreign investment) in delivery of deposited securities or otherwise in connection with the depositary’s or its custodian’s compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations.
 
We will pay all other charges and expenses of the depositary and any agent of the depositary (except the custodian) pursuant to agreements from time to time between us and the depositary. The fees described above may be amended from time to time.
 
Our depositary has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses we incur that are related to establishment and maintenance of the ADR program, including investor relations expenses and exchange application and listing fees. There are limits on the amount of expenses for which the depositary will reimburse us, but the amount of reimbursement available to us is not related to the amounts of fees the depositary collects from investors. The depositary collects its fees for issuance and cancellation of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect its annual fee for depositary

205

Table of Contents

services by deduction from cash distributions, or by directly billing investors, or by charging the book-entry system accounts of participants acting for them. The depositary may generally refuse to provide services to any holder until the fees owing by such holder for those services and any other unpaid fees are paid.
 
Payment of Taxes
 
ADR holders must pay any tax or other governmental charge payable by the custodian or the depositary on any ADS or ADR, deposited security or distribution. If an ADR holder owes any tax or other governmental charge, the depositary may (i) deduct the amount thereof from any cash distributions, or (ii) sell deposited securities and deduct the amount owing from the net proceeds of such sale. In either case the ADR holder remains liable for any shortfall. Additionally, if any tax or governmental charge is unpaid, the depositary may also refuse to effect any registration, registration of transfer, split-up or combination of deposited securities or withdrawal of deposited securities (except under limited circumstances mandated by securities regulations). If any tax or governmental charge is required to be withheld on any non-cash distribution, the depositary may sell the distributed property or securities to pay such taxes and distribute any remaining net proceeds to the ADR holders entitled thereto.
 
By holding an ADR or an interest therein, you will be agreeing to indemnify us, the depositary, its custodian and any of our or their respective directors, employees, agents and affiliates against, and hold each of them harmless from, any claims by any governmental authority with respect to taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest arising out of any refund of taxes, reduced rate of withholding at source or other tax benefit obtained in respect of, or arising out of, your ADSs.
 
Reclassifications, Recapitalizations and Mergers
 
If we take certain actions that affect the deposited securities, including (i) any change in par value, split-up, consolidation, cancellation or other reclassification of deposited securities or (ii) any recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, then the depositary may choose to:
 
(i) amend the form of ADR;
 
(ii) distribute additional or amended ADRs;
 
(iii) distribute cash, securities or other property it has received in connection with such actions;
 
(iv) sell any securities or property received and distribute the proceeds as cash; or
 
(v) none of the above.
 
If the depositary does not choose any of the above options, any of the cash, securities or other property it receives will constitute part of the deposited securities and each ADS will then represent a proportionate interest in such property.
 
Amendment and Termination
 
How May the Deposit Agreement be Amended?
 
We may agree with the depositary to amend the deposit agreement and the ADSs without your consent for any reason. ADR holders must be given at least 30 days notice of any amendment that imposes or increases any fees or charges (other than stock transfer or other taxes and other governmental charges, transfer or registration fees, cable, telex or facsimile transmission costs, delivery costs or other such expenses), or prejudices any substantial existing right of ADR holders. If an ADR holder continues to hold an ADR or ADRs after being so notified, such ADR holder is deemed to agree to such amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any governmental body or

206

Table of Contents

regulatory body should adopt new laws, rules or regulations which would require amendment or supplement of the deposit agreement or the form of ADR to ensure compliance therewith, we and the depositary may amend or supplement the deposit agreement and the ADR at any time in accordance with such changed laws, rules or regulations, which amendment or supplement may take effect before a notice is given or you otherwise receive notice. No amendment, however, will impair your right to surrender your ADSs and receive the underlying securities.
 
How May the Deposit Agreement be Terminated?
 
The depositary may terminate the deposit agreement by giving the ADR holders at least 30 days prior notice, and it must do so at our request. The deposit agreement will be terminated on the removal of the depositary for any reason. After termination, the depositary’s only responsibility will be (i) to deliver deposited securities to ADR holders who surrender their ADRs, and (ii) to hold or sell distributions received on deposited securities. As soon as practicable after the expiration of six months from the termination date, the depositary will sell the deposited securities which remain and hold the net proceeds of such sales, without liability for interest, in trust for the ADR holders who have not yet surrendered their ADRs. After making such sale, the depositary shall have no obligations except to account for such proceeds and other cash. The depositary will not be required to invest such proceeds or pay interest on them.
 
Limitations on Obligations and Liability to ADR holders
 
Limits on our Obligations and the Obligations of the Depositary; Limits on Liability to ADR Holders and Holders of ADSs
 
Prior to the issue, registration, registration of transfer, split-up, combination, or cancellation of any ADRs, or the delivery of any distribution in respect thereof, the depositary and its custodian may require you to pay, provide or deliver:
 
 	• 	payment with respect thereto of (i) any stock transfer or other tax or other governmental charge, (ii) any stock transfer or registration fees in effect for the registration of transfers of shares or other deposited securities upon any applicable register and (iii) any applicable fees and expenses described in the deposit agreement;
 
 	• 	the production of proof satisfactory to the depositary and/or its custodian of (i) the identity of any signatory and genuineness of any signature and (ii) such other information, including without limitation, information as to citizenship, residence, exchange control approval, beneficial ownership of any securities, payment of applicable taxes or governmental charges, or legal or beneficial ownership and the nature of such interest, information relating to the registration of the shares on the books maintained by or on our behalf for the transfer and registration of shares, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, provisions of or governing deposited securities and terms of the deposit agreement and the ADR, as it may deem necessary or proper; and
 
 	• 	compliance with such regulations as the depositary may establish consistent with the deposit agreement.
 
The deposit agreement expressly limits the obligations and liability of the depositary, us and our respective agents. Neither we nor the depositary nor any such agent will be liable if:
 
present or future law, rule or regulation of the United States, the Cayman Islands or any other country, or of any governmental or regulatory authority or securities exchange or market or automated quotation system, the provisions of or governing any deposited securities, any present or future provision of our charter, any act of God, war, terrorism or other circumstance beyond our, the depositary’s or our respective agents’ control shall prevent, delay or subject to any civil or criminal penalty any act which the deposit agreement or the ADRs provides shall be done or performed by us, the depositary or our respective agents (including, without limitation, voting);

207

Table of Contents

it exercises or fails to exercise discretion under the deposit agreement or the ADR;
 
it performs its obligations without gross negligence or bad faith;
 
it takes any action or refrains from taking any action in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting shares for deposit, any registered holder of ADRs, or any other person believed by it to be competent to give such advice or information; or
 
it relies upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
 
Neither the depositary nor its agents have any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any deposited securities or the ADRs. We and our agents shall only be obligated to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any deposited securities or the ADRs, which in our opinion may involve us in expense or liability, if indemnity satisfactory to us against all expense (including fees and disbursements of counsel) and liability is furnished as often as may be required. The depositary and its agents may fully respond to any and all demands or requests for information maintained by or on its behalf in connection with the deposit agreement, any registered holder or holders of ADRs, any ADSs or otherwise to the extent such information is requested or required by or pursuant to any lawful authority, including without limitation laws, rules, regulations, administrative or judicial process, banking, securities or other regulators.
 
The depositary will not be responsible for failing to carry out instructions to vote the deposited securities or for the manner in which the deposited securities are voted or the effect of the vote. In no event shall we, the depositary or any of our respective agents be liable to holders of ADSs or interests therein for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages.
 
The depositary may own and deal in deposited securities and in ADSs.
 
Disclosure of Interest in ADSs
 
To the extent that the provisions of or governing any deposited securities may require disclosure of or impose limits on beneficial or other ownership of deposited securities, other shares and other securities and may provide for blocking transfer, voting or other rights to enforce such disclosure or limits, you agree to comply with all such disclosure requirements and ownership limitations and to comply with any reasonable instructions we may provide in respect thereof. We reserve the right to request you to deliver your ADSs for cancellation and withdrawal of the deposited securities so as to permit us to deal with you directly as a holder of deposited securities and, by holding an ADS or an interest therein, you will be agreeing to comply with such instructions.
 
Requirements for Depositary Actions
 
We, the depositary or the custodian may refuse to
 
 	• 	issue, register or transfer an ADR or ADRs;
 
 	• 	effect a split-up or combination of ADRs;
 
 	• 	deliver distributions on any such ADRs; or
 
 	• 	permit the withdrawal of deposited securities (unless the deposit agreement provides otherwise), until the following conditions have been met:
 
 	• 	the holder has paid all taxes, governmental charges, and fees and expenses as required in the deposit agreement;

208

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	the holder has provided the depositary with any information it may deem necessary or proper, including, without limitation, proof of identity and the genuineness of any signature; and
 
 	• 	the holder has complied with such regulations as the depositary may establish under the deposit agreement.
 
The depositary may also suspend the issuance of ADSs, the deposit of shares, the registration, transfer, split-up or combination of ADRs, or the withdrawal of deposited securities (unless the deposit agreement provides otherwise), if the register for ADRs or any deposited securities is closed or the depositary decides it is advisable to do so.
 
Books of Depositary
 
The depositary or its agent will maintain a register for the registration, registration of transfer, combination and split-up of ADRs, which register shall include the depositary’s direct registration system. You may inspect such records at such office during regular business hours, but solely for the purpose of communicating with other holders in the interest of business matters relating to the deposit agreement. Such register may be closed from time to time, when deemed expedient by the depositary.
 
The depositary will maintain facilities to record and process the issuance, cancellation, combination, split-up and transfer of ADRs. These facilities may be closed from time to time, to the extent not prohibited by law.
 
Pre-release of ADSs
 
The depositary may issue ADSs prior to the deposit with the custodian of shares (or rights to receive shares). This is called a pre-release of the ADS. A pre-release is closed out as soon as the underlying shares (or rights to receive shares from us or from any registrar, transfer agent or other entity recording share ownership or transactions) are delivered to the depositary. The depositary may pre-release ADSs only if:
 
 	• 	the depositary has received collateral for the full market value of the pre-released ADSs (marked to market daily); and
 
 	• 	each recipient of pre-released ADSs agrees in writing that he or she:
 
 	• 	owns the underlying shares,
 
 	• 	assigns all rights in such shares to the depositary,
 
 	• 	holds such shares for the account of the depositary and
 
 	• 	will deliver such shares to the custodian as soon as practicable, and promptly if the depositary so demands.
 
In general, the number of pre-released ADSs will not evidence more than 30% of all ADSs outstanding at any given time (excluding those evidenced by pre-released ADSs). However, the depositary may change or disregard such limit from time to time as it deems appropriate. The depositary may retain for its own account any earnings on collateral for pre-released ADSs and its charges for issuance thereof.

Appointment
 
In the deposit agreement, each holder and each person holding an interest in ADSs, upon acceptance of any ADSs (or any interest therein) issued in accordance with the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement will be deemed for all purposes to:
 
 	• 	be a party to and bound by the terms of the deposit agreement and the applicable ADR or ADRs, and
 
 	• 	appoint the depositary its attorney-in -fact, with full power to delegate, to act on its behalf and to take any and all actions contemplated in the deposit agreement and the applicable ADR or ADRs, to adopt any and all procedures necessary to comply with applicable laws and to take such action as the depositary in its sole discretion may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the deposit agreement and the applicable ADR and ADRs, the taking of such actions to be the conclusive determinant of the necessity and appropriateness thereof.

DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES
 
The notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture, to be dated as of          , 2007 between us and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee. The terms of the notes include those expressly set forth in the indenture and the notes and those made part of the indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
 
The following summary of the terms of the notes and the indenture does not purport to be complete and is subject, and qualified in its entirety by reference, to the detailed provisions of the notes and the indenture. We will provide copies of the indenture to you upon request, and they are also available for inspection at the office of the trustee. Those documents, and not this description, define your legal rights as a holder of the notes.
 
For purposes of this summary, the terms “Yingli Green Energy,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer only to Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited and not to any of its subsidiaries, unless we specify otherwise.
 
General
 
The notes:
 
 	• 	are limited to US$150,000,000 million aggregate principal amount, or US$172,500,000 if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes from us;
 
 	• 	the notes do not bear interest;
 
 	• 	will be issued in denominations of integral multiples of US$1,000 principal amount;
 
 	• 	are our unsecured indebtedness and are equal in right of payment to our other senior unsecured indebtedness as described under “— Ranking;”
 
 	• 	are convertible into our ADSs based on an initial conversion rate of             ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately US$             per ADS) under the conditions and subject to the adjustments described under “— Conversion Rights,” except that in lieu of delivering our ADSs upon the conversion of a note, we may elect to deliver cash or a combination of cash and our ADSs as described under “— Conversion Rights — Settlement Upon Conversion;”
 
 	• 	are redeemable, in whole or in part, by us at any time on or after          , if the closing sale price of our ADSs for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the date one trading day prior to any day we give a notice of redemption is greater than     % of the early redemption amount on the date of such notice divided by the conversion rate on the date of such notice, at a redemption price in cash equal to the early redemption amount as described “— Redemption of Notes At Our Option;”
 
 	• 	are subject to purchase by us at the option of the holder on February 15, 2010, at a purchase price in cash equal to     % of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, as described under “— Purchase of Notes by Us at the Option of the Holder;”
 
 	• 	are subject to repurchase by us at the option of the holder upon a fundamental change, as described under “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change,” at a repurchase price in cash equal to the early redemption amount; and
 
 	• 	mature on          ,      , unless previously redeemed, repurchased or converted
 
We may also from time to time repurchase the notes in tender offers, open market purchases or negotiated transactions without prior notice to holders.

211

Table of Contents

We will initially issue the notes as global securities in book-entry form. All cash payments on the notes will be made in U.S. dollars. We will make payments in respect of notes represented by global securities by wire transfer of immediately available funds to DTC or its nominee as registered owner of the global securities. We will make payments in respect of notes that are issued in certificated form by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by each holder of more than US$5.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. However, if a holder of a certificated note does not specify an account, or holds US$5.0 million or less in aggregate principal amount of notes, then we will mail a check to that holder’s registered address.
 
The trustee’s main role is to enforce your rights against us if there is a default under the indenture. We describe some of the limitations on the extent to which the trustee acts on your behalf under “— Events of Default” below. You may convert notes at the office of the conversion agent, present notes for registration of transfer at the office of the registrar for the notes and present notes for payment at maturity at the office of the paying agent. We have appointed the trustee to act as the initial conversion agent, registrar, bid solicitation agent and paying agent. The trustee has also agreed to perform administrative duties for us, such as mailing notices under the indenture.
 
We will not provide a sinking fund for the notes. The indenture does not contain any financial covenants and will not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including senior or secured indebtedness, pay dividends or repurchase our securities. In addition, the indenture does not provide any protection to holders of notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction or a change in control, except as, and only to the limited extent, described under “— Conversion Rights — Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change”, “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change” and “— Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”.
 
If any payment date with respect to the notes falls on a day that is not a business day, we will make the payment on the next business day. The payment made on the next business day will be treated as though it had been made on the original payment date, and no interest will accrue on the payment for the additional period of time.
 
“Business day” means any weekday that is not a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York are authorized or obligated to close.
 
Conversion Rights
 
If the conditions for conversion of the notes described below, including those described under “— Conversion Procedures” and “— Conditions For Conversion”, are satisfied, holders of notes may, subject to prior maturity, redemption, or repurchase, convert their notes in integral multiples of US$1,000 principal amount based on an initial conversion rate of             ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount, subject to adjustment as described below. This rate results in an initial conversion price of approximately US$             per ADS. We will not issue fractional ADSs and instead will pay a cash adjustment for any fractional ADS based on, in the event of settlement entirely in ADSs, the closing sale price of our ADSs on the day we are required to notify you of our chosen method of settlement upon conversion and, in the event of settlement wholly or partially in cash, the daily VWAP of our ADSs on the final VWAP trading day of the related “cash settlement averaging period” (as defined in the indenture).
 
If the number of our ordinary shares represented by the ADSs is changed, we will make appropriate adjustment to the conversion rate such that the number of our ordinary shares represented by the ADSs into which the notes are convertible remains the same.
 
On conversion, the holders of notes will, to the extent they receive any ADSs upon conversion, also receive (to the same extent as other holders of our ADSs) any issuance or distribution of preferred shares, or any other securities or rights, made to our ordinary shareholders by our board of

212

Table of Contents

directors or us pursuant to the anti-takeover provisions in our articles of association, whether or not such securities or rights were issued or distributed prior to conversion.
 
The conversion right with respect to any notes we have called for redemption will expire at the close of business on the third business day preceding the redemption date, unless we default in the payment of the redemption price. A note for which a holder has delivered a fundamental change repurchase notice, as described below, requiring us to repurchase the note may be surrendered for conversion only if the holder withdraws the notice in accordance with the indenture, unless we default in the payment of the fundamental change repurchase price.
 
In accordance with the deposit agreement, dated as of June 13, 2007, by and among Yingli Green Energy, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as depositary, and the owners and beneficial owners of our ADSs, we will undertake to deliver to the custodian thereunder, such ordinary shares required for the issuance of the ADSs by the depositary upon conversion of the notes, plus written delivery instructions (if requested by the depositary or the custodian) for such ADSs and any other information or documentation required by the depositary or the custodian in connection with each deposit of ordinary shares and issuance and delivery of ADSs. The delivery of ADSs by the depositary to holders upon conversion of their notes or their designated transferees will be governed by the terms of the deposit agreement.
 
Conversion Procedures
 
To convert a certificated note, the holder must complete the conversion notice on the back of the note and deliver it, together with the note, to the office of the conversion agent for the notes, which will initially be the office of the trustee. In addition, the holder must pay the applicable fees of the depositary for the issuance of such ADSs as described in the deposit agreement and any tax or duty payable as a result of any transfer involving the issuance or delivery of ADSs in a name other than that of the registered holder of the note. The note will be deemed to be converted on the date on which the holder has satisfied all of these requirements. We refer to this date as the “conversion date”. The holder must comply with DTC’s then applicable conversion program procedures.
 
A holder that has delivered a repurchase notice with respect to a note, as described below, may convert that note only if the holder withdraws the notice in accordance with the indenture. See “— Purchase of Notes By Us at the Option of the Holder” and “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change”.
 
We will deliver, through the conversion agent, the cash, ADSs or combination thereof due upon conversion of a note as soon as practicable but, in the event of settlement entirely in ADSs, no later than the fifth scheduled trading day following the day we are required to notify you of our chosen method of settlement upon conversion and, in the event of settlement wholly or partially in cash, no later than the fifth scheduled trading day following the final VWAP trading day of the related cash settlement averaging period. However, if a holder surrenders a note for conversion in connection with a “make-whole fundamental change” under circumstances where we must increase the conversion rate applicable to that note, then we will deliver, through the conversion agent, the consideration that is payable on account of the increase in the conversion rate as soon as practicable, but in no event after the later of:
 
 	• 	the delivery date described in the first sentence of this paragraph; and
 
 	• 	the third business day after the effective date of the make-whole fundamental change.
 
See “— Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change”.
 
For a discussion of certain tax considerations applicable to a holder that converts notes, see “Taxation — Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences”.

Table of Contents

We expect any newly issued ADSs to be accepted into the book-entry system maintained by DTC, and no person receiving ADSs shall receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of ADSs, except in the limited circumstances set forth in the deposit agreement.
 
We will agree to take all such actions and obtain all such approvals and registrations with respect to the conversion of the notes into ADSs and the issuance, and deposit into the ADS facility, of the ordinary shares represented by such ADSs. We will also undertake to maintain, as long as the notes are outstanding, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form F-6 relating to our ADSs and an adequate number of ADSs available for issuance thereunder such that unrestricted ADSs can be delivered in accordance with the terms of the indenture, the notes and the deposit agreement upon conversion of the notes.
 
Settlement Upon Conversion
 
In lieu of delivery of ADSs in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the notes, we may elect to deliver cash or a combination of cash and ADSs.
 
We will give notice, which shall be irrevocable, to holders through the trustee of the method we choose to satisfy our obligation upon conversion no later than the second scheduled trading day immediately after the related conversion date, provided that if the related conversion date occurs during the period beginning on (and including) the 27th scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date of such note, such notice of our election shall be given to holders no later than the 28th scheduled trading day prior to such maturity.
 
We may, in lieu of sending individual notices of our election, send one notice to all holders of the method we choose to satisfy our conversion obligation for:
 
 	• 	all conversions of notes that have been selected for redemption; and
 
 	• 	all conversions that occur on or after the 27th scheduled trading day preceding          ,      ;
 
provided that such notice shall be irrevocable and shall apply to all holders converting within such period before redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
 
If we do not give any notice within the applicable time period as to how we intend to settle, we shall satisfy our conversion obligation only in ADSs and cash in lieu of fractional ADSs. If we choose to satisfy any portion of our conversion obligation in cash, we will specify the amount to be satisfied in cash as a percentage of the conversion obligation or a fixed dollar amount. We will treat all holders converting on the same day in the same manner. We will not, however, have any obligation to settle our conversion obligations on different days in the same manner. That is, we may choose on one day to settle in ADSs only and choose on another day to settle in cash or a combination of cash and ADSs.
 
Settlement of our conversion obligation that we have not elected to satisfy partially or entirely in cash will be made in ADSs as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fifth scheduled trading day, after the day we are required to notify you of our chosen method of settlement.
 
Settlement of our conversion obligation that we have elected to satisfy partially or entirely in cash will occur on the fifth scheduled trading day following the final VWAP trading day of the related cash settlement averaging period.
 
If we elect to satisfy the entire conversion obligation with ADSs, we will deliver to you a number of our ADSs equal to (i) the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted divided by US$1,000, multiplied by (ii) the applicable conversion rate. In addition, we will pay cash for all fractional ADSs (calculated on an aggregate basis for the notes surrendered for conversion) based on the closing sale price of our ADSs on the day we are required to notify you of our chosen method of settlement.

214

Table of Contents

If we elect to satisfy the entire conversion obligation in cash, we will deliver to you cash in an amount equal to the product of:
 
 	• 	a number equal to (1) the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted divided by US$1,000 multiplied by (2) the conversion rate, and
 
 	• 	the average daily VWAP of our ADSs during the cash settlement averaging period.
 
If we elect to satisfy a percentage or fixed amount (but not all) of our conversion obligation per US$1,000 principal amount of notes in cash, we will deliver to you:
 
 	• 	a dollar amount (in each case, the “cash amount”) representing the percentage that we elect of the “conversion amount” or such fixed amount per US$1,000 principal amount of note (provided that if such fixed amount exceeds the conversion amount, we will deliver the conversion amount in cash in lieu of such fixed amount); and
 
 	• 	a number of ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount of notes equal to, for each VWAP trading day of the cash settlement averaging period, the greater of:
 
 	• 	zero, and
 
 	• 	a number of ADSs determined by the following formula:
 
(daily VWAP of our ADSs on such VWAP trading day × the conversion rate) — the cash amount
daily VWAP of our ADSs on such VWAP trading day × 20
 
In these cases, we will pay cash for fractional ADSs (calculated on an aggregate basis for the notes you have surrendered for conversion) based on the daily VWAP of our ADSs on the last VWAP trading day of the cash settlement averaging period.
 
The “cash settlement averaging period” means:
 
 	• 	with respect to any conversion of a note occurring during the period beginning on (and including) the 27th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of such note, the 20 consecutive VWAP-trading day period beginning on (and including) the 24th scheduled trading day prior to such maturity; and
 
 	• 	in all other instances, the 20 consecutive VWAP trading day period beginning on (and including) the second VWAP trading day after the conversion date.
 
The “conversion amount” means the average of the products for each VWAP trading day of the cash settlement averaging period of (i) the conversion rate for such day multiplied by (ii) the daily VWAP of our ADSs on such day multiplied by (iii) the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted divided by US$1,000.
 
The “daily VWAP” for our ADSs means, for each of the 20 consecutive VWAP trading days during each cash settlement averaging period, the per ADS volume-weighted average price as displayed under the heading “Bloomberg VWAP” on Bloomberg page YGE.N <equity > AQR (or any equivalent successor page if such page is not available) in respect of the period from the scheduled open of trading on the principal trading market for our ADSs to the scheduled close of trading on such market on such VWAP trading day, or if such volume-weighted average price is unavailable, the market value of one ADS on such VWAP trading day as our board of directors determines in good faith using a volume-weighted method.
 
A “VWAP trading day” means a day during which (i) trading in our ADSs generally occurs on the principal U.S. national securities exchange on which our ADSs are listed and (ii) there is no VWAP market disruption event. If our ADSs are not so listed, then “VWAP trading day” means a business day.
 
A “VWAP market disruption event” means (i) a failure by the principal U.S. national securities exchange or market on which our ADSs are listed to open for trading during its regular trading

215

Table of Contents

session or (ii) the occurrence or existence prior to 1:00 p.m. on any scheduled trading day for our ADSs for an aggregate one half-hour period of any suspension or limitation imposed on trading (by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the stock exchange or otherwise) in our ADSs or in any options contracts or futures contracts relating to our ADSs.
 
Conditions For Conversion
 
The notes will become convertible only in certain circumstances, which we describe below. If the notes become convertible, we will provide written notice to each registered holder, at its address appearing in the notes register, and we will publicly announce, through a reputable national newswire service in the United States, and publish on our website, that the notes have become convertible, stating, among other things:
 
 	• 	the event causing the notes to become convertible;
 
 	• 	the time during which the notes will be convertible as a result of that event;
 
 	• 	if that event is a transaction described under “— Conversion Upon the Occurrence of Certain Corporate Transactions”, the anticipated effective date of the transaction; and
 
 	• 	the procedures that holders must follow to convert their notes and the name and address of the conversion agent.
 
We will mail the notice, and make the public announcement and publication, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the open of business on the first business day following the date the notes become convertible as a result of the event.
 
Holders may surrender their notes for conversion prior to maturity, earlier redemption, or repurchase only in the following circumstances:
 
Conversion Based on Price of Our ADSs
 
Prior to maturity, earlier redemption, or repurchase, holders may surrender their notes for conversion during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2007 if the “closing sale price” (as defined in the indenture) of our ADSs for each of 20 or more “trading days” (as defined in the indenture) in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds     % of the conversion price of the notes in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
 
Our board of directors will make appropriate adjustments, in its good faith determination, to account for any adjustment to the conversion rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the conversion rate where the “ex date” (as defined in the indenture) of the event occurs, during that 30 consecutive trading day period.
 
The “closing sale price” of our ADSs on any trading day generally means the closing sale price of our ADSs (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices per ADS or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices per ADS) on such trading day on the New York Stock Exchange or other principal U.S. national securities exchange on which our ADSs are listed or, if our ADSs are not then listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, as otherwise provided in the indenture.
 
“Trading day” generally means any day during which:
 
 	• 	trading in our ADSs generally occurs;
 
 	• 	there is no “market disruption event” (as defined in the indenture); and
 
 	• 	a closing sale price for our ADSs is provided on the New York Stock Exchange or, if our ADSs are not then listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on such other principal U.S. national securities exchange on which our ADSs are then listed.

216

Table of Contents

 
“Market disruption event” generally means the occurrence or existence during the one-half hour period ending on the scheduled close of trading on any trading day for our ADSs of any material suspension or limitation imposed on trading (by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the stock exchange or otherwise) in our ADSs or in any options, contracts or future contracts relating solely to our ADSs.
 
Conversion Upon Satisfaction of the Trading Price Condition
 
Prior to maturity, earlier redemption, or repurchase, holders may surrender their notes for conversion during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (we refer to this five consecutive trading day period as the “note measurement period”) if the average trading price per US$1,000 principal amount of the notes, as determined following a request by a holder of notes in accordance with the procedures described below, was equal to or less than 97% of the average conversion value of the notes during the note measurement period.
 
We refer to this condition as the “trading price condition”.
 
For purposes of the trading price condition, the “conversion value” per US$1,000 principal amount of notes on a trading day is the product of the closing sale price per ADS of our ADSs and the applicable conversion rate of the notes in effect on that trading day.
 
Except as described below, the “trading price” of the notes on any day means the average secondary market bid quotations obtained by the bid solicitation agent for US$5,000,000 principal amount of the notes at approximately 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on such day from three independent nationally recognized securities dealers we select, which may include any or all of the underwriters or their affiliates. However, if the bid solicitation agent can reasonably obtain only two such bids, then the average of the two bids will instead be used, and if the bid solicitation agent can reasonably obtain only one such bid, then that one bid will be used. Even still, if on a given day:
 
 	• 	the bid solicitation agent cannot reasonably obtain at least one bid for US$5,000,000 principal amount of the notes from an independent nationally recognized securities dealer; or
 
 	• 	in the reasonable, good faith judgment of our board of directors, the bid quotation or quotations that the bid solicitation agent has obtained are not indicative of the secondary market value of the notes,
 
then the trading price per US$1,000 principal amount of the notes will be deemed to be equal to 97% of the product of the closing sale price of our ADSs on that day and the conversion rate in effect on that day.
 
The bid solicitation agent will have no obligation to determine the trading price of the notes unless we have requested it to do so, and we will have no obligation to make such request unless a holder provides us with reasonable evidence that the trading price per US$1,000 principal amount of the notes would be equal to or less than 97% of the conversion value of the notes. At such time, we will instruct the bid solicitation agent to determine the trading price of the notes for each of the next five trading days and on each following trading day until the trading price condition is no longer satisfied.
 
Conversion Based On Redemption
 
If we call a note for redemption, the holder of that note may surrender the note for conversion at any time before the close of business on the third business day preceding the redemption date.

217

Table of Contents

Conversion Upon the Occurrence of Certain Corporate Transactions
 
If:
 
 	• 	a “fundamental change,” as described under “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change”, or a “make-whole fundamental change”, as described under “— Conversion Rights — Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change” occurs; or
 
 	• 	we are party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, reconstruction, amalgamation or other similar arrangement pursuant to which our ordinary shares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) would be converted into or exchanged for, or would constitute solely the right to receive, cash, securities or other property,
 
then a holder may surrender its notes for conversion at any time during the period that begins on, and includes, the 30th scheduled trading day before the date we originally announce as the anticipated effective date of the transaction and ends on, and includes, the 30th business day after the actual effective date of the transaction. In addition, if the transaction is a “make-whole fundamental change”, then the notes may also be surrendered for conversion at any time during the “make-whole conversion period” described under “— Conversion Rights — Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change”, and if the transaction is a “fundamental change”, then the notes may also be surrendered for conversion at any time until (and including) the fundamental change repurchase date for that fundamental change. Holders that convert their notes in connection with a “make-whole fundamental change” may in some circumstances also be entitled to an increased conversion rate. See “— Conversion Rights — Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change”.
 
“Scheduled trading day” means a day that is scheduled to be a trading day on the principal U.S. national securities exchange on which our ADSs are listed.
 
In addition, if we take any action, or become aware of any event, that would require an adjustment to the conversion rate as described in paragraphs (2) through (5) under “— Conversion Rights — Adjustments To The Conversion Rate” below, then we must mail to registered holders written notice of the action or event at least 30 scheduled trading days before the ex-date, effective date or expiration date, as the case may be, of the transaction. Holders may surrender their notes for conversion beginning on the date we mail the notice (or, if earlier, the date the indenture requires us to mail the notice) until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the ex-date, effective date or expiration date, as the case maybe, of the transaction or until we announce that the transaction will not take place.
 
Conversion During Specified Periods
 
The notes may be surrendered for conversion at any time during the periods from (and including)           to (and including) the third business day Preceding the maturity date.
 
Change In The Conversion Right Upon Certain Reclassifications, Business Combinations, Asset Sales And Corporate Events
 
Except as provided in the indenture and as described below, if we reclassify our ordinary shares (other than a change only in par value or a change as a result of a subdivision or combination of our ordinary shares) or are party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, reconstruction, amalgamation or other similar arrangement, or if we sell, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our property or assets, in each case pursuant to which our ordinary shares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) would be converted into or exchanged for, or would constitute solely the right to receive, cash, securities or other property, then, at the effective time of the transaction, the right to convert a note will be changed into a right to convert it into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property (the “reference property”), which a holder of such note

218

Table of Contents

would have received (assuming, if applicable, that the holder would have made the applicable election referred to in the immediately following paragraph) if the holder had converted the note and, upon such conversion, received, immediately before the transaction, ordinary shares in a number equal to the product of the number of ordinary shares represented by each ADS at the time multiplied by the conversion rate then applicable multiplied by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of the note. However, at and after the effective time of the transaction, we may continue to elect to satisfy our obligation under the indenture in whole or in part by delivering cash in lieu of reference property upon the conversion of a note and the conversion amount will be calculated based on the fair value of the reference property.
 
A change in the conversion right such as this could substantially lessen or eliminate the value of the conversion right. For example, if a third party acquires us in a cash merger, each note would be convertible solely into cash and would no longer be potentially convertible into securities whose value could increase depending on our future financial performance, prospects and other factors. There is no precise, established definition of the phrase “all or substantially all of our property or assets” under applicable law. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty as to whether the provisions above would apply to a sale, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our property or assets.
 
If a transaction described above occurs and holders of our ordinary shares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to receive in that transaction, then we will make adequate provision to give holders of the notes, treated as a single class, a reasonable opportunity to elect the form of such consideration for purposes of determining the composition of the “reference property” described above. Once the election is made, it will apply to all holders of the notes after the effective time of the transaction.
 
If our ADS facility maintained with the depositary is terminated for any reason, but such event does not constitute a “termination of trading” (as defined below in “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change”) because our ordinary shares are then listed for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange, all references to our ADSs will be deemed to refer to our ordinary shares, all references to the “closing sale price” and “daily VWAP” of our ADSs will be deemed to refer to the “closing sale price” and “daily VWAP” of our ordinary shares, and other appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect such change.
 
If our ADS facility maintained with the depositary is terminated for any reason and such event does constitute a “termination of trading,” then the provisions of “Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change” shall apply.
 
In the event of and upon the termination of our ADR facility (whether or not such event constitutes a “termination of trading”), the right to convert a note will be changed into a right to convert it into ordinary shares at a conversion rate (subject to the anti-dilution and other conversion rate adjustment provisions set forth in the indenture) equal to (i) the number of ordinary shares represented by each ADS immediately prior to such termination, multiplied by (ii) the conversion rate applicable immediately prior to such termination, multiplied by (iii) the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of the note.
 
Adjustments To The Conversion Rate
 
Subject to the terms of the indenture, we will adjust the conversion rate as described below.
 
(1) If we issue our ordinary shares as a dividend or distribution on our ordinary shares, or if we effect a share split or share combination, the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 	 	 	 	 
CR’ = CR0
 	×	 	OS’
 	 	 	 	
 	 	 	 	OS0

219

Table of Contents

where,
 
CR0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the “ex-date” for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be;
 
CR’ = the conversion rate in effect immediately after the “ex-date” for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be;
 
OS0 = the number of our ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the “ex-date” for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be; and
 
OS’ = the number of our ordinary shares that will be outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend or distribution or immediately after the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be.
 
(2) If we distribute to all or substantially all holders of our ordinary shares any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days after the record date for such distribution to subscribe for or purchase our ordinary shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) at a price per share less than the closing sale price of our ADSs divided by the number of ordinary shares then represented by each ADS on the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution, the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula; provided that the conversion rate will be readjusted to the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration:
 
 	 	 	 	 
CR’ = CR0
 	×	 	OS0 + X
 	 	 	 	
 	 	 	 	OS0 + Y
 
where,
 
CR0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the “ex-date” for such distribution;
 
CR’ = the conversion rate in effect immediately after the “ex-date” for such distribution;
 
OS0 = the number of our ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the “ex-date” for such distribution;
 
X = the total number of our ordinary shares issuable (directly or in the form of ADSs) pursuant to such rights or warrants; and
 
Y = the number of our ordinary shares equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such right or warrants divided by the average of the closing sale prices of our ADSs divided by the number of ordinary shares then represented by each ADS over the 10 consecutive trading-day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the “ex-date” for such distribution.
 
(3) If we distribute any interests in our share capital, evidences of our indebtedness or other assets or property to all or substantially all holders of our ordinary shares, excluding:
 
 	• 	dividends or distributions referred to in clause (1) or (2) above;
 
 	• 	dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash; and
 
 	• 	spin-offs described below in this paragraph (3);
 
then the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 	 	 	 	 
CR’ = CR0
 	×	 	SP0
 	 	 	 	
 	 	 	 	SP0 − FMV

220

Table of Contents

where,
 
CR0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the “ex-date” for such distribution;
 
CR’ = the conversion rate in effect immediately after the “ex-date” for such distribution;
 
SP0 = the average of the closing sale prices of our ADSs divided by the number of ordinary shares then represented by each ADS over the 10 consecutive trading-day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the “ex-date” for such distribution; and
 
FMV = the fair market value as determined by our board of directors of the interests in our share capital, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding ordinary share on the “ex-date” for such distribution.
 
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (3) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on our ordinary shares in shares of any class or series, or similar equity interest, in the share capital of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of ours, which we refer to as a “spinoff,” the conversion rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 10th trading day immediately following (and including) the effective date of the spin-off will be increased based on the following formula:
 
 	 	 	 	 
CR’ = CR0
 	×	 	FMV0 + MP0
 	 	 	 	
 	 	 	 	MP0
 
where,
 
 	CR0 =	the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the 10th trading day immediately following the effective date of the spin-off;
 
 	CR’ =	the conversion rate in effect immediately after the 10th trading day immediately following the effective date of the spin-off;
 
 	FMV0 =	the average of the last reported sale prices of the shares or similar equity interest distributed to holders of our ordinary shares applicable to one ordinary share over the first 10 consecutive trading-day period immediately following (and including) the effective date of the spin-off; and
 
 	MP0 =	the average of the closing sale prices of our ADSs divided by the number of ordinary shares then represented by each ADS over the first 10 consecutive trading-day period immediately following (and including) the effective date of the spin-off.
 
The adjustment to the conversion rate under the preceding paragraph will occur on the 10th trading day from (and including) the effective date of the spin-off; provided that in respect of any conversion within the first 10 trading days immediately following (and including) the effective date of any spin-off, references with respect to the spin-off to 10 trading days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of trading days as have elapsed between the effective date of such spin-off and the conversion date in determining the applicable conversion rate.
 
(4) If we pay any cash dividends or distributions to all or substantially all holders of our ordinary shares, the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 	 	 	 	 
CR’ = CR0
 	×	 	SP0
 	 	 	 	
 	 	 	 	SP0 − C
 
where,
 
CR0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the “ex-date” for such distribution;
 
CR’ = the conversion rate in effect immediately after the “ex-date” for such distribution;

221

Table of Contents

 	SP0 =	the closing sale price of our ADSs divided by the number of ordinary shares then represented by each ADS on the trading day immediately preceding the “ex-date” for such distribution; and
 
C = the amount in cash per share we distribute to holders of our ordinary shares.
 
(5) If we or any of our subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for our ordinary shares, or ADSs representing our ordinary shares, then to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of our ordinary shares, or equivalent payment per ordinary share represented by our ADSs, exceeds the closing sale price of our ADSs divided by the number of ordinary shares then represented by each ADS on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the conversion rate will be increased based on the following formula:
 
 	 	 	 	 
CR’ = CR0
 	×	 	AC + (SP’ × OS’)
 	 	 	 	
 	 	 	 	OS0 × SP’
 
where,
 
CR0 = the conversion rate in effect on the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
 
 	CR’ =	the conversion rate in effect on the day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
 
 	AC =	the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration as determined by our board of directors paid or payable for the ordinary shares purchased (directly or in the form of ADSs) in such tender or exchange offer;
 
 	OS0 =	the number of our ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
 
 	OS’ =	the number of our ordinary shares outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer); and
 
 	SP’ =	the closing sale price of our ADSs divided by the number of ordinary shares then represented by each ADS on the trading day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
 
If the application of any of the foregoing formulas (other than in connection with a share combination) would result in a decrease in the conversion rate, no adjustment to the conversion rate will be made.
 
Events That Will Not Result In Adjustments
 
The applicable conversion rate will not be adjusted:
 
 	• 	upon the issuance of any ordinary shares pursuant to any future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on our securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in ordinary shares under any such plan;
 
 	• 	upon the issuance of any ordinary shares, or any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security to purchase our ordinary shares, pursuant to any future agreements entered into with our suppliers of raw materials or machinery as consideration or inducement to enter into such supply agreement;
 
 	• 	upon the issuance of any ordinary shares, or options or rights to purchase those shares, pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by us or any of our subsidiaries;

222

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	upon the issuance of any ordinary shares pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in the preceding bullet and outstanding as of the date the notes were first issued; or
 
 	• 	for a change in the par value of our ordinary shares.
 
If we issue rights, options or warrants that are only exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, then:
 
 	• 	we will not adjust the conversion rate pursuant to the provisions of the indenture described above until the earliest of these triggering events occurs; and
 
 	• 	we will readjust the conversion rate to the extent any of these rights, options or warrants are not exercised before they expire.
 
The indenture does not require us to adjust the conversion rate for any of the events described in the provisions of the indenture described above if we make provision for holders of notes to participate in the transaction without conversion on a basis and with notice that our board of directors determines in good faith to be fair and appropriate, as provided in the indenture.
 
We will not adjust the conversion rate pursuant to the provisions of the indenture described above unless the adjustment would result in a change of at least 1% in the then effective conversion rate. However, we will carry forward any adjustment that we would otherwise have to make and take that adjustment into account in any subsequent adjustment. In addition, we will give effect to all adjustments that we have otherwise deferred pursuant to this provision, and those adjustments will no longer be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, (i) if we mail a notice of redemption or if a fundamental change or make-whole fundamental change, or any transaction described under “— Conversion Rights — Conversion Upon the Occurrence of Certain Corporate Transactions” above, occurs, (ii) annually, upon each anniversary of the date of the first issuance of the notes, and (iii) on the 24th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the notes and each VWAP trading day thereafter until the maturity date.
 
To the extent permitted by law and the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, we may, from time to time, increase the conversion rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 days or any longer period permitted by law, so long as the increase is irrevocable during that period and our board of directors determines that the increase is in our best interests. We will mail a notice of the increase to registered holders at least 15 days before the day the increase commences. In addition, we may, but are not obligated to, also increase the conversion rate as we determine to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish taxes to recipients of certain distributions.
 
On conversion, the holders of notes will, to the extent they receive our ADSs upon conversion, also receive (to the same extent as other holders of our ADSs) any issuance or distribution of preferred shares, or any other securities or rights, made to our ordinary shareholders (including the depositary or its nominee as the holder of ordinary shares represented by our ADSs) by our board of directors or us pursuant to the anti-takeover provisions in our articles of association, whether or not such securities or rights were issued or distributed prior to conversion. A distribution of securities or rights pursuant to such a shareholder rights plan will not trigger a conversion rate adjustment pursuant to paragraphs (2) or (3) above so long as we have made proper provision to provide that holders will, to the extent they receive any ADSs upon conversion, also receive such securities or rights in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement and the indenture.
 
In the event of:
 
 	• 	a taxable distribution to holders of our ordinary shares which results in an adjustment to the conversion rate; or
 
 	• 	an increase in the conversion rate at our discretion,

223

Table of Contents

 
the holders of the notes may, in certain circumstances, be deemed to have received a distribution subject to United States federal income tax as a dividend. This generally would occur, for example, if we adjust the conversion rate to compensate holders for cash dividends on our ordinary shares and could also occur if we make other distributions of cash or property to our shareholders. See “Taxation — Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences”.
 
In addition, to the extent that the number of ordinary shares represented by each ADS is changed, appropriate adjustments to the conversion rate adjustments described above (which may include ignoring such provision, if appropriate) will be made to reflect such change.
 
Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change
 
If, prior to maturity:
 
 	• 	any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), excluding Mr. Liansheng Miao and any “group” (as that term is used in Sections 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of which he is a part, is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as that term is used in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the total outstanding voting power of all classes of our share capital entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (“voting shares”), or if Mr. Liansheng Miao or any “group” of which he is a part is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as that term is used in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of 70% or more of the total outstanding voting power of all of our voting shares;
 
 	• 	there occurs a sale, transfer lease, conveyance or other disposition (other than a “permitted transfer” as described below) of all or substantially all of our property or assets to any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), including any group acting for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of securities within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (we refer to such a transaction as an “asset sale make-whole fundamental change”); or
 
 	• 	there occurs any transaction or series of related transactions (other than a “listed share business combination” as described under “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change”), in connection with which (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, dissolution, winding up, tender offer, consolidation, merger, reconstruction, amalgamation, combination, reclassification, recapitalization, asset sale, lease of assets or otherwise) our ordinary shares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) are exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive other securities, other property, assets or cash (we refer to such any transaction described in this and the two immediately preceding bullet point as a “make-whole fundamental change”),
 
then we will increase, as described below under “— The Increase in the Conversion Rate”, the conversion rate applicable to notes that are surrendered for conversion at any time from (and including) the 30th scheduled trading day before the date we originally announced as the anticipated effective date of the make-whole fundamental change to (and including) the 30th business day after the actual effective date of the make-whole fundamental change (or, if the make-whole fundamental change also constitutes a “fundamental change,” as described under “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change”, to (and including) the fundamental change repurchase date for that fundamental change). We refer to this period as the “make-whole conversion period”.
 
We will mail to registered holders, at their addresses appearing in the notes register, notice of, and we will publicly announce, through a reputable national newswire service in the United States, and publish on our website, the anticipated effective date of any proposed make-whole fundamental

224

change. We must make this mailing, announcement and publication at least 30 scheduled trading days before the first anticipated effective date of the make-whole fundamental change. In addition, no later than the third business day after the completion of the make-whole fundamental change, we must make an additional notice, announcement and publication announcing such completion.
 
A “permitted transfer” means any transfer of property or assets between or among one or more of our subsidiaries or from one or more of our subsidiaries to us.
 
If a holder surrenders a note for conversion in connection with a make-whole fundamental change we have announced, but the make-whole fundamental change is not consummated, then the holder will not be entitled to the increased conversion rate referred to above in connection with the conversion.
 
The Increase in the Conversion Rate
 
In connection with the make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate by reference to the table below, based on the date when the make-whole fundamental change becomes effective, which we refer to as the “effective date”, and the “applicable price”. If the make-whole fundamental change is a transaction or series of related transactions described in the first or third bullet point under “— Conversion Rights — Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change” and the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares or pursuant to statutory appraisal rights) for our ordinary shares in the make-whole fundamental change consists solely of cash, then the “applicable price” will be the cash amount paid per share of our ordinary shares in the make-whole fundamental change multiplied by the number of ordinary shares then represented by each ADS. In all other cases, the “applicable price” will be the average of the “closing sale prices” (as defined in the indenture) of our ADSs for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date. Our board of directors will make appropriate adjustments, in its good faith determination, to account for any adjustment to the conversion rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the conversion rate where the “ex date” (as defined in the indenture) of the event occurs, at any time during those five consecutive trading days.
 
The following table sets forth the numbers of additional ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount of notes that will be added to the conversion rate applicable to the notes that are converted during the make-whole conversion period. Such increased conversion rate will be used to determine the amount of cash, ADSs or combination thereof that are due upon conversion, as described under “— Conversion Rights — Payment Upon Conversion” above. If an event occurs that requires an adjustment to the conversion rate, we will, on the date we must adjust the conversion rate, adjust the applicable price set forth in the first column of the table below by multiplying the applicable price in effect immediately before the adjustment by a fraction:
 
 	• 	whose numerator is the conversion rate in effect immediately before the adjustment; and
 
 	• 	whose denominator is the adjusted conversion rate.
 
In addition, we will adjust the numbers of additional ADSs in the table below in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, we must adjust the conversion rate as described under “— Conversion Rights — Adjustments to the Conversion Rate”.

225

Table of Contents

The numbers of additional ADSs set forth in the table below are based on the closing sale price of US$             of our ADSs on            , 2007.

The exact applicable price and effective date for the notes may not be as set forth in the table above, in which case:
 
 	• 	if the actual applicable price is between two applicable prices listed in the table above, or the actual effective date is between two dates listed in the table above, we will determine the number of additional ADSs to be added in respect of the notes by linear interpolation between the numbers of additional ADSs set forth for the two applicable prices in the table above, or for the two dates based on a 365-day year, as applicable;
 
 	• 	if the actual applicable price is greater than US$             per ADS (subject to adjustment), we will not increase the conversion rate; and
 
 	• 	if the actual applicable price is less than US$             per ADS (subject to adjustment), we will not increase the conversion rate.
 
In no event will the conversion rate for the notes exceed             ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount. We will adjust this maximum conversion rate in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, we must adjust the conversion rate as described under “— Conversion Rights — Adjustments to the Conversion Rate”.
 
Our obligation to increase the conversion rate as described above could be considered a penalty, in which case its enforceability would be subject to general principles of reasonableness of economic remedies.
 
Redemption of Notes Upon Maturity
 
Unless previously redeemed, repurchased or converted, the notes will mature on            , and we will redeem the notes at     % of the principal amount of the notes.
 
Redemption of Notes at Our Option
 
We may redeem the notes, at our option, at any time on or after          , in whole or in part in integral multiples of US$1,000, at a redemption price, payable in cash, equal to the early redemption amount, provided that the closing sale price of our ADSs for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the date one trading day prior to any day we give a notice

226

Table of Contents

of redemption is greater than     % of the early redemption amount of the notes on the date of such notice divided by the conversion rate on the date of such notice.
 
The “early redemption amount” means an amount in respect of each US$1,000 principal amount of notes calculated in accordance with the following formula, rounded (if necessary) to two decimal places with 0.005 being rounded upwards (provided that if the date fixed for redemption is a semi-annual date (as set out below), such early redemption amount shall be as set out in the table below in respect of such semi-annual date):
 
early redemption amount = previous redemption amount × (1+r/2)d/p
 
previous redemption amount = the early redemption amount for each US$1,000 principal amount on the semi-annual date immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption as set out below (or if the notes are to be redeemed prior to          , 2007, US$1,000):
 
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Early Redemption
 
Semi-annual Date
 	Amount	 
 	 	US Dollar	 
 
 
r =             per cent, expressed as a fraction
 
d = number of days from and including the immediately preceding Semi-annual Date (or if the notes are to be redeemed on or before             2007, from and including the issue date) to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of 12 months of 30 days each and, in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed
 
p = 180.
 
Each redemption date for the notes shall be a date that is not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the day we mail the related redemption notice to each registered holder of notes to be redeemed at the address of the registered holder appearing in the notes register. The redemption date must be a business day.
 
For a discussion of certain tax considerations applicable to a holder upon a redemption of notes, see “Taxation — Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences”.
 
If the paying agent holds money sufficient to pay the early redemption amount due on a note on a redemption date in accordance with the terms of the indenture, then, on and after that redemption date, the note will cease to be outstanding, whether or not the holder delivers the note to the paying agent. Thereafter, all other rights of the holder terminate, other than the right to receive the early redemption amount upon delivery of the note.
 
The conversion right with respect to any notes we have called for redemption will expire at the close of business on the third business day preceding the redemption date, unless we default in the payment of the early redemption amount.
 
If we redeem less than all of the outstanding notes, the trustee will select the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed in integral multiples of US$1,000 thereof by lot, on a pro rata basis or in accordance with any other method the trustee considers fair and appropriate. If a portion of a holder’s notes is selected for partial redemption and the holder converts a portion of the notes, the principal

227

Table of Contents

amount of the note that is subject to redemption will be reduced by the principal amount that the holder converted.
 
We will not redeem any notes at our option if there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to the notes, other than a default in the payment of the early redemption amount with respect to those notes.
 
Purchase of Notes by Us at the Option of the Holder
 
On February 15, 2010 (the “purchase date”), holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their outstanding notes in an integral multiple of US$1,000 at a price in cash equal to     % of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, subject to certain additional conditions.
 
On the purchase date, we will purchase all notes for which the holder has delivered and not withdrawn a written purchase notice. Registered holders may submit their written purchase notice to the paying agent at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 20 business days before the purchase date until the close of business on the third business day immediately preceding the purchase date.
 
For a discussion of certain tax considerations applicable to a holder receiving cash upon a purchase of the notes at the holder’s option, see “Taxation — Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences.”
 
We will give notice on a date that is at least 20 business days before the purchase date to all registered holders at their addresses shown on the register of the registrar, and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law, stating, among other things:
 
 	• 	the amount of the purchase price;
 
 	• 	that notes with respect to which the holder has delivered a purchase notice may be converted, if otherwise convertible, only if the holder withdraws the purchase notice in accordance with the terms of the indenture; and
 
 	• 	the procedures that holders must follow to require us to purchase their notes, including the name and address of the paying agent.
 
To require us to purchase its notes, the holder must deliver a purchase notice that states:
 
 	• 	the certificate numbers of the holder’s notes to be delivered for purchase, if they are in certificated form;
 
 	• 	the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, which must be an integral multiple of US$1,000; and
 
 	• 	that the notes are to be purchased by us pursuant to the applicable provisions of the indenture.
 
A holder that has delivered a purchase notice may withdraw the purchase notice by delivering a written notice of withdrawal to the paying agent before the close of business on the third business day before the purchase date. The notice of withdrawal must state:
 
 	• 	the name of the holder;
 
 	• 	a statement that the holder is withdrawing its election to require us to purchase its notes;

228

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	the certificate numbers of the notes being withdrawn, if they are in certificated form;
 
 	• 	the principal amount being withdrawn, which must be an integral multiple of US$1,000; and
 
 	• 	the principal amount, if any, of the notes that remain subject to the purchase notice, which must be an integral multiple of US$1,000.
 
If the notes are not in certificated form, the above notices must comply with appropriate DTC procedures.
 
To receive payment of the purchase price for a note for which the holder has delivered and not validly withdrawn a purchase notice, the holder must deliver the note, together with necessary endorsements, to the paying agent at any time after delivery of the purchase notice. We will pay the purchase price for the note on or before the third business day after the later of the purchase date and the time of delivery of the note, together with necessary endorsements.
 
If the paying agent holds on the purchase date money sufficient to pay the purchase price due on a note in accordance with the terms of the indenture, then, on and after the purchase date, the note will cease to be outstanding, whether or not the holder delivers the note to the paying agent. Thereafter, all other rights of the holder terminate, other than the right to receive the purchase price upon delivery of the note.
 
We may not have the financial resources, and we may not be able to arrange for financing, to pay the purchase price for all notes holders have elected to have us purchase. Furthermore, the terms of our future indebtedness may limit our ability to pay the purchase price to purchase notes. Our failure to purchase the notes when required would result in an event of default with respect to the notes.
 
We will not purchase any notes at the option of holders if there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to the notes, other than a default in the payment of the purchase price with respect to those notes or a default arising from our failure to provide the notice described above.
 
In connection with any purchase offer, we will, to the extent applicable:
 
 	• 	comply with the provisions of Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E and all other applicable laws; and
 
 	• 	file a Schedule TO or any other required schedule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or other applicable laws.
 
Repurchase of Notes by Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change
 
If a “fundamental change,” as described below, occurs, each holder will have the right, at its option, subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture, to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the holder’s notes in integral multiples of US$1,000 principal amount, at the early redemption amount, on the date set by us for such repurchase, which we refer to as the “fundamental change repurchase date.”
 
However, the fundamental change repurchase date must be no later than 35 days, and no earlier than 20 days, after the date we have mailed a notice of the fundamental change, as described below.
 
Within 20 business days after the occurrence of a fundamental change, we must mail to all registered holders of notes at their addresses shown on the register of the registrar, and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law, a notice regarding the fundamental change. We must also publicly release, through a reputable national newswire service in the United States, and publish on our website, a notice of the fundamental change. The notice must state, among other things:
 
 	• 	the events causing the fundamental change;

229

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	the date of the fundamental change;
 
 	• 	the fundamental change repurchase date;
 
 	• 	the last date on which a holder may exercise the repurchase right;
 
 	• 	the fundamental change repurchase price;
 
 	• 	the names and addresses of the paying agent and the conversion agent;
 
 	• 	the procedures that holders must follow to exercise their repurchase right;
 
 	• 	the conversion rate and any adjustments to the conversion rate that will result from the fundamental change; and
 
 	• 	that notes with respect to which a holder has delivered a fundamental change repurchase notice may be converted, if otherwise convertible, only if the holder withdraws the fundamental change repurchase notice in accordance with the terms of the indenture.
 
To exercise the repurchase right, a holder must deliver a written fundamental change repurchase notice to the paying agent no later than the close of business on the third business day immediately preceding the fundamental change repurchase date. This written notice must state:
 
 	• 	the certificate numbers of the notes that the holder will deliver for repurchase, if they are in certificated form;
 
 	• 	the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased which must be an integral multiple of US$1,000; and
 
 	• 	that the notes are to be repurchased by us pursuant to the fundamental change provisions of the indenture.
 
A holder may withdraw any fundamental change repurchase notice by delivering to the paying agent a written notice of withdrawal prior to the close of business on the third business day immediately preceding the fundamental change repurchase date. The notice of withdrawal must state:
 
 	• 	a statement that the holder is withdrawing its election to require us to repurchase its notes;
 
 	• 	the certificate numbers of the notes being withdrawn, if they are in certificated form;
 
 	• 	the principal amount of the notes being withdrawn, which must be an integral multiple of US$1,000; and
 
 	• 	the principal amount of the notes that remain subject to the fundamental change repurchase notice which must be an integral multiple of US$1,000.
 
If the notes are not in certificated form, the above notices must comply with appropriate DTC procedures.
 
To receive payment of the fundamental change repurchase price for a note for which the holder has delivered and not validly withdrawn a fundamental change repurchase notice, the holder must deliver the note, together with necessary endorsements, to the paying agent at any time after delivery of the fundamental change repurchase notice. We will pay the fundamental change repurchase price for the note on or before the third business day after the later of the fundamental change repurchase date and the time of delivery of the note, together with necessary endorsements.
 
For a discussion of certain tax considerations applicable to a holder upon the exercise of the repurchase right, see “Taxation — Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences”.
 
If the paying agent holds on the fundamental change repurchase date money sufficient to pay the fundamental change repurchase price due on a note in accordance with the terms of the indenture, then, on and after the fundamental change repurchase date, the note will cease to be outstanding, whether or not the holder delivers the note to the paying agent. Thereafter, all other

rights of the holder terminate, other than the right to receive the fundamental change repurchase price upon delivery of the note.
 
A “fundamental change” generally will be deemed to occur upon the occurrence of a “change in control” or a “termination of trading.”
 
A “change in control” generally will be deemed to occur at such time as:
 
 	• 	any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), excluding Mr. Liansheng Miao and any “group” (as that term is used in Sections 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of which he is a part, is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as that term is used in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the total outstanding voting power of all classes of our share capital entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (“voting shares”), or if Mr. Liansheng Miao or any “group” of which he is a part is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as that term is used in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of 70% or more of the total outstanding voting power of all of our voting shares;
 
 	• 	there occurs a sale, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition (other than a “permitted transfer” as described under “— Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change” above) of all or substantially all of our property or assets to any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), including any group acting for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of securities within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
 
 	• 	we consolidate or amalgamate with, merge with or into, or are reconstructed into another person or any person consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or are reconstructed into us, unless either:
 
 	• 	the persons that “beneficially owned”, directly or indirectly, our voting shares immediately prior to such transaction “beneficially own,” directly or indirectly, immediately after such transaction, the surviving or continuing corporation’s voting shares representing at least a majority of the total outstanding voting power of all outstanding classes of voting shares of the surviving or continuing corporation in substantially the same proportion as such ownership immediately prior to such transaction; or
 
 	• 	both of the following conditions are satisfied (we refer to such a transaction as a “listed share business combination”):
 
 	• 	at least 90% of the consideration (other than cash payments for fractional ADSs or pursuant to statutory appraisal rights) in such consolidation or merger consists of ordinary shares, shares or ADSs traded on a U.S. national securities exchange (or which will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with such transaction); and
 
 	• 	as a result of such transaction, the notes become convertible solely into such ordinary shares, shares or ADSs (subject to our right to elect full or partial cash settlement of our conversion obligation);
 
 	• 	the following persons cease for any reason to constitute a majority of our board of directors:
 
 	• 	individuals who on the first issue date of the notes constituted our board of directors; and
 
 	• 	any new directors whose election to our board of directors or whose nomination for election by our shareholders was approved by at least a majority of our directors then still in office either who were directors on such first issue date of the notes or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved; or

 	• 	we are liquidated, dissolved or wound up or our shareholders approve any plan or proposal for our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
 
There is no precise, established definition of the phrase “all or substantially all of our property or assets” under applicable law. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty as to whether a sale, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our property or assets would permit a holder to exercise its right to have us repurchase its notes in accordance with the fundamental change provisions described above.
 
A “termination of trading” is deemed to occur when neither our ADSs (or other securities into which the notes are then convertible) nor the ordinary shares represented by our ADSs are listed for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange.
 
We may not have the financial resources, and we may not be able to arrange for financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price for all notes holders have elected to have us repurchase. Furthermore, the terms of our existing or future indebtedness may limit our ability to pay the repurchase price to repurchase notes. Our failure to repurchase the notes when required would result in an event of default with respect to the notes. The exercise by holders of the notes of their right to require us to repurchase their notes upon a fundamental change could cause a default under our other outstanding indebtedness, even if the fundamental change itself does not.
 
We may in the future enter into transactions, including recapitalizations, that would not constitute a fundamental change but that would increase our debt or otherwise adversely affect holders of the notes. The indenture for the notes does not restrict our or our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, including senior or secured indebtedness. Our incurrence of additional indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to service our indebtedness, including the notes.
 
In addition, the fundamental change repurchase feature of the notes would not necessarily afford holders of the notes protection in the event of highly leveraged or other transactions involving us that may adversely affect holders of the notes. Furthermore, the fundamental change repurchase feature of the notes may in certain circumstances deter or discourage a third party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition may be beneficial to you.
 
In connection with any fundamental change offer, we will, to the extent applicable:
 
 	• 	comply with the provisions of Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E and all other applicable laws; and
 
 	• 	file a Schedule TO or any other required schedule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or other applicable laws.
 
Ranking
 
The notes will be our unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all our other unsecured senior indebtedness. However, the notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The notes will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities, including trade payables and lease obligations of our subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2007, our subsidiaries had approximately US$189.7 million of indebtedness and other obligations to which the notes would be structurally subordinated. All of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Any right by us to receive the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon a liquidation or reorganization of that subsidiary, and the consequent right of the holders of the notes to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiary, in which case our claims would still be subordinated to any security interests in the assets of such subsidiary and any indebtedness of such subsidiary that is senior to that held by us.
 
Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on the notes or to make any funds available for payment on the notes, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. In addition, the payment of dividends and the

232

Table of Contents

making of loans and advances to us by those subsidiaries may be subject to statutory, contractual or other restrictions, may depend on the earnings or financial condition of those subsidiaries and are subject to various business considerations. As a result, we may be unable to gain access to the cash flow or assets of our subsidiaries.
 
The indenture does not limit the amount of additional indebtedness, including senior or secured indebtedness, which we can create, incur, assume or guarantee, nor does the indenture limit the amount of indebtedness or other liabilities that our subsidiaries can create, incur, assume or guarantee.
 
Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets
 
The indenture prohibits us from consolidating or amalgamating with or merging with or into or reconstructing into or entering into other similar arrangements with, or selling, transferring, leasing, conveying or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our property or assets to, another person, whether in a single transaction or series of related transactions, unless, among other things:
 
 	• 	such other person is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Hong Kong, the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;
 
 	• 	such person assumes all of our obligations under the notes and the indenture; and
 
 	• 	no default or event of default exists immediately after giving effect to the transaction or series of transactions.
 
When the successor assumes all of our obligations under the indenture, except in the case of a lease, our obligations under the indenture will terminate. An assumption of our obligations under the notes and the indenture by such successor might be deemed for United States federal income tax purposes to be an exchange of the notes for new notes by the holders thereof, resulting in recognition of gain or loss for such purposes and possibly other adverse tax consequences to the holders. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of such an assumption. See “Taxation — Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences”.
 
Some of the transactions described above could constitute a fundamental change that permits holders to require us to repurchase their notes, as described under “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental Change”.
 
There is no precise, established definition of the phrase “all or substantially all of our property or assets” under applicable law. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty as to whether the provisions above would apply to a sale, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our property or assets.
 
Events of Default
 
The following are events of default under the indenture for the notes:
 
 	• 	our failure to pay the principal of or premium, if any, on any note when due, whether at maturity, upon redemption, on the purchase date with respect to a purchase at the option of the holder, a repurchase in the event of a fundamental change or otherwise;
 
 	• 	our failure to satisfy our conversion obligations upon the exercise of a holder’s conversion right;
 
 	• 	our failure to timely provide notice as described under “— Conversion Rights — Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon the Occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change”, “— Purchase of Notes By Us at the Option of the Holder” or “— Repurchase of Notes By Us in the Event of a Fundamental change;

233

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	our failure to comply with any other term, covenant or agreement contained in the notes or the indenture, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after notice to us by the trustee or to the trustee and us by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, in accordance with the indenture;
 
 	• 	a default by us or any of our subsidiaries in the payment when due, after the expiration of any applicable grace period, of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, indebtedness for money borrowed in the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of US$15 million or more, or acceleration of our or our subsidiaries’ indebtedness for money borrowed in such aggregate principal amount or more so that it becomes due and payable before the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, if such default is not cured or waived, or such acceleration is not rescinded, within 60 days after notice to us by the trustee or to us and the trustee by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of notes then outstanding, in accordance with the indenture;
 
 	• 	failure by us or any of our subsidiaries, within 60 days, to pay, bond or otherwise discharge any judgments or orders for the payment of money the total uninsured amount of which for us or any of our subsidiaries exceeds US$15 million, which are not stayed on appeal; and
 
 	• 	certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries that is a “significant subsidiary” (as defined in Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) or any group of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate would constitute a “significant subsidiary”.
 
If an event of default, other than an event of default referred to in the last bullet point above with respect to us (but including an event of default referred to in that bullet point solely with respect to a significant subsidiary, or group of subsidiaries that in the aggregate would constitute a significant subsidiary, of ours), has occurred and is continuing, either the trustee, by notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, by notice to us and the trustee, may declare the principal of all notes to be immediately due and payable. In the case of an event of default referred to in the last bullet point above with respect to us (and not solely with respect to a significant subsidiary, or group of subsidiaries that in the aggregate would constitute a significant subsidiary, of ours), the principal of all notes, will automatically become immediately due and payable.
 
After any such acceleration, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes, by written notice to the trustee, may rescind or annul such acceleration in certain circumstances, if:
 
 	• 	the rescission would not conflict with any order or decree;
 
 	• 	all events of default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, have been cured or waived; and
 
 	• 	certain amounts due to the trustee are paid.
 
The indenture does not obligate the trustee to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or demand of the holders, unless the holders have offered to the trustee security or indemnity that is reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities that the trustee may incur to comply with the request or demand. Subject to the indenture, applicable law and the trustee’s rights to indemnification, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee.
 
No holder will have any right to institute any proceeding under the indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or a trustee, or for any other remedy under the indenture, unless:
 
 	• 	the holder gives the trustee written notice of a continuing event of default;
 
 	• 	the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding make a written request to the trustee to pursue the remedy;

234

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	the holder or holders offer and, if requested, provide the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against any loss, liability or expense; and
 
 	• 	the trustee fails to comply with the request within 60 days after the trustee receives the written notice, request and offer of indemnity and does not receive, during those 60 days, from holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, a direction that is inconsistent with the request.
 
However, the above limitations do not apply to a suit by a holder to enforce:
 
 	• 	the payment of any amounts due on that holder’s notes after the applicable due date; or
 
 	• 	the right to convert that holder’s notes in accordance with the indenture.
 
Except as provided in the indenture, the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes may, by written notice to the trustee, waive any past default or event of default and its consequences, other than a default or event of default:
 
 	• 	in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on, any note or in the payment of the redemption price or fundamental change repurchase price;
 
 	• 	arising from our failure to convert any note in accordance with the indenture; or
 
 	• 	in respect of any provision under the indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holders of each outstanding note affected.
 
We will promptly notify the trustee in writing upon our becoming aware of the occurrence of any default or event of default. In addition, the indenture requires us to furnish to the trustee, on an annual basis, a statement by our officers stating whether they have actual knowledge of any default or event of default by us in performing any of our obligations under the indenture or the notes and describing any such default or event of default. If a default or event of default has occurred and the trustee has received written notice of the default or event of default in accordance with the indenture, the trustee must mail to each registered holder a notice of the default or event of default within 30 days after receipt of the notice. However, the trustee need not mail the notice if the default or event of default:
 
 	• 	has been cured or waived; or
 
 	• 	is not in the payment of any amounts due with respect to any note and the trustee in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the best interests of holders.
 
Modification and Waiver
 
We may amend or supplement the indenture or the notes with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes may waive our compliance with any provision of the indenture or notes. However, without the consent of the holders of each outstanding note affected, no amendment, supplement or waiver may:
 
 	• 	change the stated maturity of the principal of any note;
 
 	• 	reduce the principal amount of any note;
 
 	• 	change the place, manner or currency of payment of principal of any note;
 
 	• 	impair the right to institute a suit for the enforcement of any payment on, or with respect to, or of the conversion of, any note;
 
 	• 	modify, in a manner adverse to the holders of the notes, the provisions of the indenture relating to the right of the holders to require us to repurchase notes at their option or upon a fundamental change;
 
 	• 	modify the ranking provisions of the indenture in a manner adverse to the holders of the notes;

235

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	adversely affect the right of the holders of the notes to convert their notes in accordance with the indenture;
 
 	• 	reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes whose holders must consent to a modification or amendment of the indenture or the notes;
 
 	• 	reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes whose holders must consent to a waiver of compliance with any provision of the indenture or the notes or a waiver of any default or event of default; or
 
 	• 	modify the provisions of the indenture with respect to modification and waiver (including waiver of a default or event of default), except to increase the percentage required for modification or waiver or to provide for the consent of each affected holder.
 
We may amend or supplement the indenture or the notes without notice to or the consent of any holder of the notes to:
 
 	• 	evidence the assumption of our obligations under the indenture and the notes by a successor upon our consolidation, merger, reconstruction, amalgamation or entering into other similar arrangement or the sale, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of our property or assets in accordance with the indenture;
 
 	• 	provide for the issuance of additional notes pursuant to any exercise by the underwriters of their option to cover over-allotments, if any;
 
 	• 	make adjustments in accordance with the indenture to the right to convert the notes upon certain reclassifications or changes in our ordinary shares or ADSs and certain consolidations, mergers, binding share exchanges, reconstructions, amalgamations and other similar arrangements and upon the sale, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of our property or assets;
 
 	• 	make any changes or modifications to the indenture necessary in connection with the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939;
 
 	• 	evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor trustee under the indenture;
 
 	• 	secure our obligations in respect of the notes;
 
 	• 	add to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of the notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon us;
 
 	• 	make provision with respect to adjustments to the conversion rate as required by the indenture or to increase the conversion rate in accordance with the indenture; or
 
 	• 	make any changes of a formal, minor or technical nature or necessary to correct a manifest error or to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law as evidenced by an opinion of counsel so long as such change does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the notes in any material respect.
 
In addition, we and the trustee may enter into a supplemental indenture without the consent of holders of the notes in order to cure any ambiguity, defect, omission or inconsistency in the indenture in a manner that does not, individually or in the aggregate with all other changes, adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect.
 
Except as provided in the indenture, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes, by written notice to the trustee, generally may:
 
 	• 	waive compliance by us with any provision of the indenture or the notes, as detailed in the indenture; and

236

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	waive any past default or event of default and its consequences, except a default or event of default:
 
 	• 	in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on, any note or in the payment of the redemption price or fundamental change repurchase price;
 
 	• 	arising from our failure to convert any note in accordance with the indenture; or
 
 	• 	in respect of any provision under the indenture that cannot he modified or amended without the consent of the holders of each outstanding note affected.
 
Discharge
 
We may generally satisfy and discharge our obligations under the indenture by:
 
 	• 	delivering all outstanding notes to the trustee for cancellation; or
 
 	• 	depositing with the trustee or the paying agent after the notes have become due and payable, whether at stated maturity or any redemption date, or fundamental change repurchase date, cash sufficient to pay all amounts due on all outstanding notes and paying all other sums payable under the indenture.
 
In addition, in the case of a deposit, there must not exist a default or event of default on the date we make the deposit, and the deposit must not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the indenture.
 
Calculations in Respect of Notes
 
We are responsible for making all calculations called for under the indenture and notes. These calculations include, but are not limited to, determination of the trading price of the notes, the current market price of our ADSs, the number of ADSs, if any, issuable upon conversion of the notes, the amount of cash, if any, payable upon conversion or repurchase of the notes. We will make all of these calculations in good faith, and, absent manifest error, these calculations will be final and binding on all holders of notes. We will provide a copy of these calculations to the trustee and the conversion agent, as required, and the trustee and the conversion agent are entitled to rely on the accuracy of our calculations without independent verification. The trustee and/or the conversion agent will forward our calculations to any holder of notes upon the request of the holder.
 
Additional Amounts
 
All payments made by us under or with respect to the notes will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or within any jurisdiction in which we or any successor are organized or resident for tax purposes or through which payment is made (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) (each, as applicable, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless such withholding or deduction is required by law or by regulation or governmental policy having the force of law. In the event that any such withholding or deduction is so required, we will pay to the holder of each note such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by the holder after such withholding or deduction (and after deducting any taxes on the Additional Amounts) shall equal the amounts which

237

Table of Contents

would have been received by such holder had no such withholding or deduction been required, except that no Additional Amount shall be payable:
 
 	• 	for or on account of:
 
(a) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for:
 
(i) the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or beneficial owner of such note, and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction other than merely holding such note or the receipt of payments thereunder, including, without limitation, such holder or beneficial owner being or having been a national, domiciliary or resident of such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or treated as a resident thereof or being or having been physically present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein;
 
(ii) the presentation of such note (in cases in which presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the date on which the payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, on, such note became due and payable pursuant to the terms thereof or was made or duly provided for; or
 
(iii) the failure of the holder or beneficial owner to comply with a timely request from us or any successor, addressed to the holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning such holder’s or beneficial owner’s nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, or to make any declaration or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, if and to the extent that due and timely compliance with such request is required by law, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to reduce or eliminate any withholding or deduction as to which Additional Amounts would have otherwise been payable to such holder;
 
(b) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, capital gains, excise, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(c) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charges that is payable otherwise than by withholding from payments under or with respect to the notes; or
 
(d) any combination of taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges referred to in the preceding clauses (a), (b) or (c); or
 
 	• 	with respect to any payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, on, such note to a holder, if the holder is a fiduciary, partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of any payment to the extent that such payment would be required to be included in the income under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, a member of that partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such Additional Amounts had that beneficiary, settlor, partner or beneficial owner been the holder thereof.
 
Whenever there is mentioned in any context the payment of principal of, and any premium on, any note, such mention shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts provided for in the indenture to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
 
No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees or Shareholders
 
None of our past, present or future directors, officers, employees or shareholders, as such, will have any liability for any of our obligations under the notes or the indenture or for any claim based on, or in respect or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. By accepting a note, each holder

238

Table of Contents

waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and release is part of the consideration for the issue of the notes. However, this waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
 
Reports to Trustee
 
We will furnish to the trustee copies of our annual report to shareholders, containing audited financial statements, and any other financial reports which we furnish to our shareholders.
 
Unclaimed Money
 
If money deposited with the trustee or paying agent for the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on, the notes remains unclaimed for two years, the trustee and paying agent will pay the money back to us upon our written request. However, the trustee and paying agent have the right to withhold paying the money back to us until they publish (in no event later than 5 days after we request repayment) in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of New York, or mail to each registered holder, a notice stating that the money will be paid back to us if unclaimed after a date no less than 30 days from the publication or mailing. After the trustee or paying agent pays the money back to us, holders of notes entitled to the money must look to us for payment as general creditors, subject to applicable law, and all liability of the trustee and the paying agent with respect to the money will cease.
 
Purchase and Cancellation
 
The registrar, paying agent and conversion agent will forward to the trustee any notes surrendered to them for transfer, exchange, payment or conversion, and the trustee will promptly cancel those notes in accordance with its customary procedures. We will not issue new notes to replace notes that we have paid or delivered to the trustee for cancellation or that any holder has converted.
 
We may, to the extent permitted by law, purchase notes in the open market or by tender offer at any price or by private agreement. We may, at our option and to the extent permitted by law, reissue, resell or surrender to the trustee for cancellation any notes we purchase in this manner. Notes surrendered to the trustee for cancellation may not be reissued or resold and will be promptly cancelled.
 
Replacement of Notes
 
We will replace mutilated, lost, destroyed or stolen notes at the holder’s expense upon delivery to the trustee of the mutilated notes or evidence of the loss, destruction or theft of the notes satisfactory to the trustee and us. In the case of a lost, destroyed or stolen note, we or the trustee may require, at the expense of the holder, indemnity (including in the form of a bond) reasonably satisfactory to us and the trustee.
 
Trustee and Transfer Agent
 
The trustee for the notes is Wilmington Trust Company, and we have appointed the trustee as the paying agent, bid solicitation agent, registrar, conversion agent and custodian with regard to the notes. The indenture permits the trustee to deal with us and any of our affiliates with the same rights the trustee would have if it were not trustee. However, under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, if the trustee acquires any conflicting interest and there exists a default with respect to the notes, the trustee must eliminate the conflict or resign. Wilmington Trust Company and its affiliates may from time to time in the future provide banking and other services to us in the ordinary course of their businesses.

239

Table of Contents

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, subject to certain exceptions. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee must exercise its rights and powers under the indenture using the same degree of care and skill as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The indenture does not obligate the trustee to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or demand of the holders, unless the holders have offered to the trustee security or indemnity that is satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities that the trustee may incur to comply with the request or demand.
 
Listing and Trading
 
The notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system. We do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of trading market for the notes. Our ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “YGE”.
 
Form, Denomination and Registration of Notes
 
General
 
The notes will be issued in registered form in denominations of integral multiples of US$1,000 principal amount, in the form of global securities, as further provided below. See “— Global Securities” below for more information. The trustee need not:
 
 	• 	register the transfer of or exchange any note for a period of 20 days before selecting notes to be redeemed;
 
 	• 	register the transfer of or exchange any note during the period beginning at the opening of business 20 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of notes selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing; or
 
 	• 	register the transfer of or exchange any note that has been selected for redemption or for which the holder has delivered, and not validly withdrawn, or fundamental change repurchase notice, except, in the case of a partial redemption or repurchase, that portion of the notes not being redeemed or repurchased.
 
We will not impose a service charge in connection with any transfer or exchange of any note, but we may in general require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge imposed in connection with the transfer or exchange.
 
Global Securities
 
Global securities have been deposited with the trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, and registered in the name of DTC or a nominee of DTC.
 
Except in the limited circumstances described below and in “— Certificated Securities,” holders of notes will not be entitled to receive notes in certificated form. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated securities, each global security may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC.
 
The global securities are held by DTC in its book-entry settlement system. The custodian and DTC will electronically record the principal amount of notes represented by global securities held within DTC. Beneficial interests in the global securities will be shown on records maintained by DTC and its direct and indirect participants. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of a global security, DTC or such nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such global security for all purposes under the indenture and the notes. No owner of a beneficial interest in a global security will be able to transfer such interest except in

240

Table of Contents

accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures and the applicable procedures of its direct and indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. These limitations and requirements may impair the ability to transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global security.
 
Payments of principal, and premium, if any, under each global security will be made to DTC or its nominee as the registered owner of such global security. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such payment, will immediately credit DTC participants’ accounts with payments proportional to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the relevant global security as shown on the records of DTC. We also expect that payments by DTC participants to owners of beneficial interests will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants, and none of us, the trustee, the custodian or any paying agent or registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial interests in any global security or for maintaining or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial interests.
 
DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC was created to hold the securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants, which eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the underwriters), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own the depository. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. The ownership interest and transfer of ownership interests of each beneficial owner or purchaser of each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the direct and indirect participants.
 
Certificated Securities
 
The trustee will exchange each beneficial interest in a global security for one or more certificated securities registered in the name of the owner of the beneficial interest, as identified by DTC, only if:
 
 	• 	DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for that global security or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, in either case, we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days of such notice or cessation; or
 
 	• 	an event of default has occurred and is continuing and the trustee has received a request from DTC to issue certificated securities.
 
Settlement and Payment
 
We will make payments in respect of notes represented by global securities by wire transfer of immediately available funds to DTC or its nominee as registered owner of the global securities. We will make payments in respect of notes that are issued in certificated form by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by each holder of more than US$5.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. However, if a holder of a certificated note does not specify an account, or holds US$5.0 million or less in aggregate principal amount of notes, then we will mail a check to that holder’s registered address.

We expect the notes will trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and DTC will require all permitted secondary market trading activity in the notes to be settled in immediately available funds. We expect that secondary trading in any certificated securities will also be settled in immediately available funds.
 
Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds.
 
Although DTC has agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global securities among DTC participants, DTC is under no obligation to perform or to continue those procedures, and those procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the underwriters or the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its direct or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.
 
We have obtained the information we describe in this prospectus concerning DTC and its book-entry system from sources that we believe to be reliable, but neither we nor the underwriters take any responsibility for the accuracy of this information.
 
Governing Law
 
The indenture and the notes will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to such state’s conflicts of laws principles.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE
 
Upon completion of the ADS offering, we will have 36,500,000 outstanding ADSs representing approximately 28.8% of our ordinary shares in issue. All of the ADSs sold in our initial public offering and the ADS offering and the ordinary shares they represent will be freely transferable by persons other than our “affiliates” without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. Sales or perceived sales of substantial amounts of our ADSs in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices and value of our ADSs and the notes. Our ordinary shares will not be listed on any exchange or quoted for trading on any over-the-counter trading system. We do not expect that a trading market will develop for our ordinary shares not represented by the ADSs.
 
Lock-up Agreements
 
In connection with this offering, each of the selling shareholders, our directors and executive officers has agreed, subject to some exceptions, not to transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of our ordinary shares, in the form of ADSs or otherwise, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our ordinary shares, in the form of ADSs or otherwise, for a period of 90 days after the date of this prospectus. After the expiration of the 90-day period, the ordinary shares or ADSs held by the selling shareholders, our directors, executive officers or our other existing shareholders may be sold subject to the restrictions under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or by means of registered public offerings.
 
The 90-day restricted period is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. If (1) during the last 17 days of the 180-day restricted period, we release an earnings results or material news or a material event relating to us occurs; or (2) prior to the expiration of the 90-day restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period following the last day of the 90-day period, the restrictions will continue to apply until the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the release of the earnings results or the occurrence of the material news or material event, as applicable, unless, with respect to the restricted period applicable to us and our selling shareholders, directors, executive officers and our other existing shareholders, such extension is waived by the sole global coordinator for this offering.
 
Rule 144
 
In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, subject to the terms of any applicable lock-up agreement as described above, a person who has beneficially owned “restricted securities” for at least one year would be entitled to sell in the United States, within any three-month period, a number of shares that is not more than the greater of:
 
 	• 	1.0% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding; or
 
 	• 	the average weekly reported trading volume of our ADSs on the NYSE during the four calendar weeks proceeding the date on which a notice of the sale on Form 144 is filed with the SEC by such person.
 
Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to manner-of-sale provisions, notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us. However, these shares would remain subject to lock-up arrangements and would only become eligible for sale when the lock-up period expires. Persons who are not our affiliates may be exempt from these restrictions under Rule 144(k) discussed below.
 
Rule 144(k)
 
Under Rule 144(k), a person who is not deemed to have been our affiliate at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned the ordinary shares proposed to be sold for at least two years from the later of the date these shares were acquired from us or from our affiliate, including the holding period of any prior owner other than an affiliate, is entitled to sell those

shares in the United States immediately following this offering without complying with the manner-of -sale, public information, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144. However, these shares would remain subject to lock-up arrangements and would only become eligible for sale when the lock-up period expires.
 
Registration Rights
 
Upon completion of this offering, certain holders of our ordinary shares, in the form of ADSs or otherwise, or their transferees will be entitled to request that we register their shares under the Securities Act, following the expiration of the lock-up agreements described above. See “Description of Share Capital — Registration Rights”.

TAXATION
 
The following summary of the material Cayman Islands, People’s Republic of China and United States federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ADSs, our ordinary shares or the notes is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which are subject to change. This summary does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our ADSs, our ordinary shares or the notes, such as the tax consequences under U.S., state, local and other tax laws. To the extent that the discussion relates to matters of Cayman Islands tax law, it constitutes the opinion of Conyers Dill & Pearman, our Cayman Islands counsel.
 
Cayman Islands Taxation
 
The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or brought within, the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.
 
We have, pursuant to Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, obtained an undertaking from the Governor-in-Council that:
 
(a) no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income or gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations:
 
(b) the aforesaid tax or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be payable on our ordinary shares, debentures or other obligations.
 
The undertaking that we have obtained is for a period of 20 years from August 15, 2006.
 
People’s Republic of China Taxation
 
Under the PRC Income Tax Law for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises effective until December 31, 2007, any dividends payable, or distributions made, by us to beneficial owners of our ADSs will not be subject to any PRC tax, provided that such holders or beneficial owners are not deemed PRC residents under the PRC tax law and, in the case of enterprises, do not have establishments in China with which income on the notes or ADSs may be connected. Moreover, the transfer of the notes or ADS by such holders or shareholders would not be subject to PRC tax.
 
Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, or the EIT Law, which will take effect beginning January 1, 2008, enterprises established under the laws of non-PRC jurisdictions but whose “de facto management body” is located in the PRC are considered “resident enterprises” for PRC tax purposes. It is currently unclear under which situations the Chinese tax authorities would consider a non-PRC enterprise’s “de facto management body” to be located in the PRC. However, substantially all of our management is currently based in the PRC, and may remain in the PRC after the effectiveness of the EIT Law. If we are treated as a “resident enterprise” for PRC tax purposes, we will be subject to PRC income tax on our worldwide income at a uniform tax rate of 25%.
 
Moreover, the EIT Law provides that an income tax rate of 20% will normally be applicable to interest and dividends payable to non-PRC investors that are individuals or “non-resident enterprises”, to the extent such interest and dividends have their source within the PRC. The applicable tax rate may be reduced by the State Council. However, what will constitute income derived from sources within the PRC is currently unclear. In particular, if we are considered a PRC “resident enterprise”, it is unclear whether the dividends we pay with respect to our ADS would be treated as PRC-source income and be subject to PRC tax.

245

Table of Contents

 
Similarly, if we are considered a PRC “resident enterprise”, PRC tax law may apply to the conversion of the notes into ADSs. Currently there are no PRC tax rules that specifically address the treatment of convertible notes, and whether the exchange of notes for ADSs upon the exercise of conversion rights is a taxable transaction is unclear. In addition, whether any gain upon the disposition of the notes (whether through exchange for ADSs upon conversion or otherwise) would be treated as PRC source income is uncertain, although regulations to be issued in December 2007 by the State Council to implement the EIT Law may provide guidance on this point.
 
Finally, under the EIT Law, our ADSs holders may be subject to PRC income tax at a rate of 20% on any gain they realize from the transfer of their shares or ADSs, if such income is regarded as income from sources within the PRC.
 
United States Federal Income Taxation
 
The following discussion, to the extent it states matters of law or legal conclusions, and subject to the qualifications herein, constitutes the opinion of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, our U.S. Counsel, on the material United States federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the notes and the ADSs (or ordinary shares subsequently received in exchange for ADSs), as of the date hereof. The discussion set forth below is applicable to you if you are a U.S. Holder (as defined below). Except where noted, this summary deals only with a note, ADS or ordinary share held as a capital asset by a U.S. holder. As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a holder of a note, ADS or ordinary share that is for United States federal income tax purposes:
 
 	• 	an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
 
 	• 	a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
 	• 	an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 
 	• 	a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
 
This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are:
 
 	• 	a dealer in securities or currencies;
 
 	• 	a financial institution;
 
 	• 	a regulated investment company;
 
 	• 	a real estate investment trust;
 
 	• 	an insurance company;
 
 	• 	a tax-exempt organization;
 
 	• 	a person holding the notes, our ADSs or our ordinary shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction, a constructive sale or a straddle;
 
 	• 	a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;
 
 	• 	a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

246

Table of Contents

 
 	• 	a person who owns 10% or more of our voting stock;
 
 	• 	a U.S. expatriate; or
 
 	• 	a person whose “functional currency” is not the United States dollar.
 
The discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and United States Treasury regulations, rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be replaced, revoked or modified (possibly with retroactive effect) so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below.
 
If a partnership holds the notes, ADSs or ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding the notes, ADSs or ordinary shares, you should consult your own tax advisors.
 
The discussion below does not contain a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of your acquisition, ownership and disposition of the notes, ADSs or ordinary shares, as well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.
 
The U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties through whom ADSs are pre-released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by U.S. Holders of ADSs. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax, described in “—ADSs — Distributions on the ADSs or Ordinary Shares” below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate holders. Accordingly, the creditabilities of PRC taxes, if any, and the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain non - corporate holders, each described in “—ADSs — Distributions on the ADSs or Ordinary Shares” below, could be affected by actions taken by parties through whom the ADSs are released.
 
Notes
 
Sale, Exchange, Redemption, or other Disposition of Notes
 
Except as provided below under “Conversion of Notes”, you will generally recognize gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of a note equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition and your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your tax basis in a note will generally be equal to the amount you paid for the note. Any gain or loss recognized on a taxable disposition of the note will be capital gain or loss. If you are a non-corporate U.S. Holder, including an individual, and you have held the note for more than one year, such capital gain will be subject to reduced rates of taxation under current law. Your ability to deduct capital losses may be limited. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise” under PRC tax law (see discussion under “Taxation — People’s Republic of China Taxation”), it is uncertain whether you would be subject to PRC withholding taxes on any gain recognized upon a sale or other disposition of a note. If any PRC tax were to be imposed on a gain, such PRC tax may be considered foreign taxes eligible for credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability under the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC, subject to certain limitations. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign withholding tax is imposed on a disposition of a note, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.

247

Table of Contents

 
Conversion of Notes
 
If you receive only ADSs upon conversion of your notes (except cash in lieu of a fractional ADS), you will generally not recognize gain or loss except to the extent of cash received in lieu of a fractional ADS. The amount of gain or loss you recognize on the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional ADS will be equal to the difference between the amount of cash you receive in respect of the fractional ADS and the portion of your adjusted tax basis in the notes and fees incurred in connection with the conversion that are allocable to the fractional ADS. The tax basis of the ADSs received upon a conversion will equal the adjusted tax basis of the note that was converted plus fees incurred in connection with the conversion (excluding the portion of the tax basis and fees that are allocable to any fractional ADS). Your holding period for the ADSs will include the period during which you held the notes.
 
If you receive solely cash in exchange for your notes upon conversion, your gain or loss will be determined in the same manner as if you disposed of the notes in a taxable disposition (as described above under “Sale, Exchange, Redemption or other Disposition of Notes”).
 
If you receive a combination of cash and ADSs in exchange for your notes upon conversion or repurchase, we intend to take the position that gain, but not loss, will be recognized equal to the excess of the fair market value of the ADSs and cash received (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share) over your adjusted tax basis in the note (excluding the portion of the tax basis that is allocable to any fractional share), but in no event should the gain recognized exceed the amount of cash received. The amount of gain or loss recognized on the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share will be equal to the difference between the amount of cash you receive in respect of the fractional share and the portion of your adjusted tax basis in the note that is allocable to the fractional share.
 
The tax basis of the ADSs received upon a conversion will equal the adjusted tax basis of the note that was converted plus fees incurred in connection with the conversion (excluding the portion of the tax basis and fees that are allocable to any fractional share), reduced by the amount of any cash received (other than cash received in lieu of a fractional share or cash attributable to accrued but unpaid), and increased by the amount of gain, if any, recognized (other than with respect to a fractional share). Your holding period for ADSs will include the period during which you held the notes.
 
In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise” under PRC tax law (see discussion under “Taxation — People’s Republic of China Taxation”), it is uncertain whether you would be subject to PRC taxes upon conversion of notes into ADSs. If any PRC tax were imposed on conversion, such PRC tax may be considered foreign taxes eligible for credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability under the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC, subject to certain limitations. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on conversion of a note, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.
 
Constructive Distributions
 
The conversion rate of the notes will be adjusted in certain circumstances. Under section 305(c) of the Code, adjustments (or failures to make adjustments) that have the effect of increasing your proportionate interest in our assets or earnings may in some circumstances result in a deemed distribution to you. Adjustments to the conversion rate made pursuant to a bona fide reasonable adjustment formula that has the effect of preventing the dilution of the interests of the holders of the notes, however, will generally not be considered to result in a deemed distribution to you. Certain of the possible conversion rate adjustments provided in the notes (including, without limitation, adjustments in respect of taxable dividends to holders of our ordinary shares) may not qualify as being pursuant to a bona fide reasonable adjustment formula. If such adjustments are made, you will be deemed to have received a distribution even though you have not received any cash or property as a result of such adjustments. Any deemed distributions will be taxable as a dividend, return of capital, or capital gain in accordance with the earnings and profits rules under the Code. It is not clear

248

Table of Contents

whether a constructive dividend deemed paid to you would be eligible for the preferential rates of United States federal income tax applicable in respect of certain dividends received under recently enacted legislation.
 
ADSs
 
If you hold ADSs, for United States federal income tax purposes, you generally will be treated as the owner of the underlying shares that are represented by such ADSs (subject to a possible challenge of this treatment by the Internal Revenue Service, as discussed under “—Distributions on ADSs or Ordinary Shares”). Accordingly, deposits or withdrawals of ordinary shares for ADSs will not be subject to United States federal income tax.
 
Taxation of Dividends and Other Distributions on the ADSs or Ordinary Shares
 
The gross amount of all our distributions to you with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares generally will be taxable as dividends and will be included in your gross income as foreign source dividend income on the date of actual or constructive receipt by the depositary, in the case of ADSs, or by you, in the case of ordinary shares, but only to the extent that the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to corporations under the Code.
 
With respect to non-corporate United States investors, certain dividends received in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2011 from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares (or ADSs backed by such shares) that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. United States Treasury Department guidelines indicate that our ADSs (which are listed on the NYSE), but not our ordinary shares, are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Thus, we believe that dividends we pay on our shares that are represented by ADSs, but not on our shares that are not so represented, currently meet such conditions required for the reduced tax rates. There can be no assurance that our ADSs will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in later years. A qualified foreign corporation also includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of certain income tax treaties with the United States. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise” under PRC tax law (see discussion under “Taxation — People’s Republic of China Taxation”), we may be eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC, and, if we are eligible for such benefits, dividends we pay on our shares, regardless of whether such shares are represented by ADSs, would be subject to the reduced rates of taxation. Non-corporate holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as “investment income” pursuant to Section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given your particular circumstances.
 
In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise” under PRC tax law, you may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid to you with respect to the ADSs or shares. In that case, however, you may be able to obtain a reduced rate of PRC withholding taxes under the treaty between the United States and the PRC if certain requirements are met. In addition, subject to certain conditions and limitations, PRC withholding taxes on dividends, if any, may be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability. For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid to you with respect to the ADSs or shares will be treated as income form sources outside the United States and will generally constitute passive

249

Table of Contents

category income. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.
 
To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits for a taxable year, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, the distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of your tax basis in your ADSs or ordinary shares, and to the extent the amount of the distribution exceeds your tax basis, the excess will be taxed as capital gain recognized on a sale or exchange. We do not intend to calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles. Therefore, you should expect that a distribution will generally be treated as a dividend.
 
Taxation of Disposition of Shares
 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will recognize taxable gain or loss on any sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of an ADS or ordinary share equal to the difference between the amount realized for the ADS or ordinary share and your tax basis in the ADS or ordinary share. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of individuals that are recognized in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011 are generally taxed at a maximum rate of 15% when the holder has a holding period greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any such gain or loss that you recognize will generally be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. However, in the event that we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise” under PRC tax law (see discussion under “Taxation — “People’s Republic of China Taxation”), we may be eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC. Under that treaty, if any PRC tax were to be imposed on any gain from the disposition of the ADSs or shares, the gain may be treated as PRC-source income. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign withholding tax is imposed on a disposition of ADSs or shares, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.
 
Passive Foreign Investment Company
 
We do not believe that we are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a passive foreign investment company, or a PFIC for 2007, and we expect to operate in such a manner so as not to become a PFIC, although there can be no assurance in this regard. However, because the determination of PFIC status requires extensive factual investigation, including ascertaining the fair market value of our assets on a quarterly basis and the character of each item of gross income that we earn, this determination is beyond the scope of legal counsel’s role, and our special U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to our PFIC status and also expresses no opinion with respect to our expectations contained in this paragraph. If we are or become a PFIC, you could be subject to additional U.S. federal income taxes on gain recognized with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares and on certain distributions, plus an interest charge on certain taxes treated as having been deferred under the PFIC rules. Non-corporate U.S. Holders will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividends received from us, if we are a PFIC in the taxable year in which such dividends are paid or in the preceding taxable year. You are urged to consult your tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding ADSs or ordinary shares if we are considered a PFIC in any taxable year.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
 
Dividend payments with respect to ADSs or ordinary shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of ADSs or ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting to the Internal Revenue Service and possible U.S. backup withholding tax. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. U.S. Holders who are required to establish their exempt status generally must provide such certification on Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the U.S. information reporting and backup withholding rules.
 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability, and you may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service and furnishing any required information.

The following table shows the per note and total underwriting discount to be paid to the underwriters in the offering of the notes. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional notes.

Total underwriting discount to be paid to the underwriters in the offering of the notes represent      % of the total amount of the offering of the notes.
 
Notes sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any notes sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount from the public offering price of up to      % of the principal amount of the notes. If all the notes are not sold at the public offering price, the representatives may change the offering price and the other selling terms.
 
We will pay all fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with the offering of the notes.
 
The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange. We have been advised by the underwriters that the underwriters intend to make a market in the notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes.
 
CERTAIN TERMS AND ARRANGEMENTS APPLICABLE TO BOTH OFFERINGS
 
Some of the underwriters are expected to make offers and sales both inside and outside the United States through their respective selling agents. Any offers and sales in the United States will be

conducted by broker-dealers registered with the SEC. Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. is expected to make offers and sales in the United States through its selling agent, Goldman, Sachs & Co.
 
The underwriters have entered into an agreement in which they agree to restrictions on where and to whom they and any dealer purchasing from them may offer ADSs and notes, as part of the distribution of the ADSs and notes. The underwriters also have agreed that they may sell ADSs and notes among themselves.
 
In connection with the offerings, we have agreed with the underwriters that we will not, without the prior consent of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, for a period of 90 days following the date of this prospectus, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, right or warrant to purchase, make any short sale, file a registration statement with respect to any of the ADSs or our ordinary shares or any securities that are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for the ADSs or our ordinary shares, or otherwise transfer or dispose of (including entering into any swap or other agreement that transfers to any other entity, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership interest): (1) our ordinary shares and depositary shares representing our ordinary shares; (2) shares of our subsidiaries or controlled affiliates and depositary shares representing those shares; and (3) securities that are substantially similar to such shares or depositary shares. We have also agreed to cause our subsidiaries and controlled affiliates to abide by the restrictions of the lock-up agreement. The restrictions of our lock-up agreement do not apply to the issuance of securities pursuant to our employee share incentive plan existing on the date of this prospectus of which the underwriters have been advised in writing and which is described in this prospectus. In addition, each of our directors and executive officers and all of the selling shareholders, have agreed to enter into a substantially similar 90-day lock-up agreement with respect to our ordinary shares, depositary shares representing our ordinary shares and securities that are substantially similar to our ordinary shares or depositary shares representing our ordinary shares, subject to customary exceptions such as (i) a bona fide gift by an individual to a donee and (ii) sales or transfers among affiliates, provided that such transfer is not a disposition for value and that such transferee agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions to which the transferor is subject.
 
The 90-day restricted period described in the preceding paragraph will be automatically extended if: (1) during the last 17 days of the 90-day restricted period, we release our earnings results or announce material news or a material event; or (2) prior to the expiration of the 90-day restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 90-day period, in which case the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date of the release of the earnings results or the announcement of the material news or material event, as applicable.
 
In connection with the offerings, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as stabilizing agent, on behalf of the underwriters, may purchase and sell ADSs or notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Shorts sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of ADSs or principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. “Covered” short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters’ options to purchase additional ADSs from the selling shareholders or additional principal amount of notes from us. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their options to purchase additional ADSs from the selling shareholders or additional principal amount of notes from us or purchasing ADSs or principal amount of notes in the open market. In determining the source of ADSs or notes to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of ADSs or notes available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional ADSs or principal amount of notes pursuant to the options granted them. “Naked” short sales are any sales in excess of such option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing ADSs or principal amount of notes in the open market. A naked short position

254

Table of Contents

is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the ADSs or notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for, or purchases of, ADSs or notes made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering.
 
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased ADSs or notes sold by, or for the account of, such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.
 
Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the ADS or notes, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the ADSs or notes. As a result, the price of the ADS or notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they are required to be conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and they may be discontinued at any time. These transactions may be effected on the New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
 
Each underwriter has represented and agreed that:
 
a. it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the ADSs or notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and
 
b. it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the ADSs or notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited and Subsidiary:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholder’s equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006. We have also audited the consolidated balance sheets of Baoding Tianwei Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd. and its subsidiary (the “Predecessor”) as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005 and September 4, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income, owners’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Predecessor as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005 and September 4, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles.
 
As described in Note 25, the Company obtained additional short-term bank borrowings and engaged in other financing transactions subsequent to December 31, 2006, which had an impact on the Company’s financial position.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006 and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006 and for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006 have been translated into United States dollars solely for the convenience of the reader. We have audited the translation and, in our opinion, such financial statements expressed in Renminbi have been translated into United States dollars on the basis set forth in Note 2(e) to the consolidated financial statements.

(“Predecessor”)
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
(1)  	Organization and Description of Business
 
(a)  	Organization
 
Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (“Yingli Green Energy”) is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and was established on August 7, 2006, as part of a series of corporate reorganization activities (the “Reorganization”) in anticipation of the initial public offering (“IPO”) of the Company (as defined below). In connection with the incorporation of Yingli Green Energy, Yingli Power Holding Company Limited (“Yingli Power”) subscribed for 50,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares at par value of US$0.01 per share and became the sole shareholder and parent company of Yingli Green Energy. Yingli Power’s sole shareholder is Mr. Liansheng Miao, the Company’s chairperson and chief executive officer. For the period from August 7, 2006 through September 4, 2006, the Company did not engage in any business or operations. On September 5, 2006, Baoding Yingli Group Co. Ltd. (“Yingli Group”) transferred its 51% equity interest in Baoding Tianwei Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd. (“Tianwei Yingli”) to Yingli Green Energy in exchange for US$17.0 million (RMB 134.6 million). At the time of the Transfer, Yingli Group and Yingli Green Energy were each under the common control of Mr. Liansheng Miao, who held 100% beneficial interest in both Yingli Group and Yingli Green Energy. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Tianwei Yingli were recorded by Yingli Green Energy based on Yingli Group’s adjusted basis of its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli as of September 5, 2006 and the minority interest’s basis of the remaining 49% equity interest determined using the historical financial statement carrying amounts of the underlying assets and liabilities of Tianwei Yingli. The recorded amount of net assets of Tianwei Yingli, net of the cash consideration paid by Yingli Green Energy, of RMB 23,034,429 has been reflected as a shareholder’s contribution on September 5, 2006.
 
Prior to August 9, 2006, Yingli Group held a 49% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli and Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co., Ltd. (“Tianwei Baobian”), an unrelated entity, held the remaining 51% equity interest. On August 9, 2006, Tianwei Yingli declared dividends of RMB 21,716,400 (US$2,898,302) and RMB 21,706,000 (US$2,896,914), to Yingli Group and Tianwei Baobian, respectively. Yingli Group reinvested the entire dividend received in the form of a paid in capital contribution of RMB 14,250,000 (US$1,901,826) and a capital surplus contribution of RMB 7,466,400 (US$996,476). Tianwei Baobian reinvested RMB 10,750,000 (US$1,434,711) of its dividend in the form of a paid in capital contribution. As a result of such dividend reinvestments, Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital increased from RMB 75,000,000 (US$10,009,609) to RMB 100,000,000 (US$13,346,146) and Yingli Group increased its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, from 49% to a controlling 51%. Under the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) laws and regulations, each equity holder’s equity ownership interest is measured based on the percentage of registered capital each investor has contributed.
 
On November 20, 2006, Yingli Green Energy completed an additional equity contribution of RMB 130,940,000 (US$17,475,443) into Tianwei Yingli and as a result increased its equity ownership in Tianwei Yingli to 53.98% from 51%. On December 18, 2006, Yingli Green Energy completed an additional contribution of RMB 484,840,000 into Tianwei Yingli and as a result further increased its equity ownership in Tianwei Yingli to 62.13% from 53.98% (See note 23).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
(b)  	Description of Business
 
Tianwei Yingli and its subsidiary Chengdu Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Yingli”) are principally engaged in the design, development, marketing, manufacturing and installation and sale of photovoltaic (“PV”) products in the PRC and overseas markets.
 
(2)  	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Concentrations and Risks
 
(a) 	Basis of Presentation
 
For financial reporting purposes, Tianwei Yingli is considered to be the predecessor (the “Predecessor”) of Yingli Green Energy. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements of Tianwei Yingli have been presented for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and the period January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006, which is the date just prior to the transfer of the controlling equity interest in Tianwei Yingli from Yingli Group to Yingli Green Energy. The consolidated financial statements of Yingli Green Energy are presented as of December 31, 2006 and for the period August 7, 2006 (date of inception) to December 31, 2006.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and Tianwei Yingli have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
 
Hereinafter, the term “Company” refers to Yingli Green Energy and its predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, for both the periods prior to and succeeding the Reorganization.
 
The nature of the Company’s operations required the Company to make significant prepayments to suppliers and purchases of inventory during 2005 and 2006. As a result there was a significant net use of cash from operating activities in 2005 and 2006. Prior to September 4, 2006, the Company has relied principally on non-operational sources of cash, primarily loans and advances from or guaranteed by related parties, and since September 5, 2006 from the issuance of equity and debt securities to fund its operational needs. The Company’s ability to continue as going concern for a reasonable period of time largely depends on the ability of management to successfully execute the Company’s business plan (including increasing sales while decreasing operating costs and expenses) and, if required, the ability to obtain additional funds, either from related parties or from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. Management believes the execution of its business plan will enable it to fund its operational cash flow needs and to meet its commitments and current liabilities as and when they fall due for a reasonable period of time. Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis the Company will be able to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months.
 
(b) 	Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements of Yingli Green Energy include both Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli and its majority-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor include Tianwei Yingli and its majority-owned subsidiary. For a consolidated subsidiary where the Company’s ownership is less than 100%, the equity interest not held by the Company is shown as minority interest. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

(c) 	Significant Concentrations and Risks
 
Revenue concentrations
 
The Company’s business depends substantially on government incentives given to its customers. In many countries in which the Company sells its products, the market of the Company’s goods would not be commercially viable on a sustainable basis without government incentives. This is largely in part caused by the cost of generating electricity from solar power currently exceeding and that is expected to continue to exceed the costs of generating electricity from conventional energy sources. The Company generated approximately 96%, 97% and 91% of its total net revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, from revenues to customers in countries with known government incentive programs for the use of solar products. A significant reduction in the scope or discontinuation of government incentive programs would have a materially adverse effect on the demand of the Company’s products.
 
A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are made to customers in Germany, Spain and the PRC. Sales to customers in Germany, Spain and the PRC are as follows:

As a result of the Company deriving significant revenue from sales outside of the PRC, the Company’s financial performance could be affected by events such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, trade protection measures and changes in regional or worldwide economic or political conditions.
 
The Company currently expects that its operating results will, for the foreseeable future, continue to depend on the sale of its PV modules to a relatively small number of customers. The Company’s relationships with such key customers have been developed over a short period of time and are generally in their preliminary stages. In addition, the Company’s business is affected by competition in the market for the products that many of the Company’s major customers sell, and any decline in their businesses could reduce purchase orders from these customers. The loss of sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. Furthermore, these customers have sought, from time to time, to prospectively renegotiate the pricing terms of their current agreements with the Company or obtain more favorable terms upon renewal of the contracts. Any adverse revisions to the material terms of the Company’s agreements with its key customers could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.

Advance payment from these customers amounted to nil, nil, RMB 48,097,977 and RMB 66,510,057 (US$8,876,529) as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively, which are reported as “advances from customers” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
 
Dependence on suppliers
 
Polysilicon is the most important raw material used in the production of the Company’s PV products. To maintain competitive manufacturing operations, the Company depends on timely delivery by its suppliers of polysilicon in sufficient quantities. The global supply of polysilicon is controlled by a limited number of producers, and there is currently an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon. The Company’s failure to obtain sufficient quantities of polysilicon in a timely manner could disrupt its operations, prevent it from operating at full capacity or limit its ability to expand as planned, which will reduce the growth of its manufacturing output and revenue.
 
In order to secure stable supply of polysilicon and other raw materials, the Company makes prepayments to certain suppliers. Such amounts are recorded as prepayments to suppliers and long-term prepayments to suppliers in the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to RMB 12,616,525, RMB 123,451,683, RMB 349,735,412 and RMB 361,096,958 (US$48,192,526) as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The Company

makes the prepayments without receiving collateral for such payments. As a result, the Company’s claims for such prepayments would rank only as an unsecured claim, which exposes the Company to the credit risks of the suppliers. As of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006, advances made to individual suppliers in excess of 10% of total prepayments to suppliers are as follows:

The Company obtains some of the equipment used in its manufacturing process from a small number of selected equipment suppliers. In addition, some equipment has been customized based on the Company’s specifications, is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace. If any of these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business, the Company may have difficulties in repairing or replacing its equipment in the event of any damage to or a breakdown of the Company’s ingot casting or manufacturing equipment. The Company’s ability to deliver products timely would suffer, which in turn could result in order cancellations and loss of revenue. In addition, the equipment needed for the Company’s expansion is in high demand. A supplier’s failure to deliver the equipment in a timely manner with adequate quality and on terms acceptable to the Company could delay its capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and otherwise disrupt its production schedule or increase its costs of production. The Company also made deposits of RMB 18,330,629, RMB 58,563,038, RMB 6,940,971 and RMB 126,823,905 (US$16,926,103) as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively, for the purchase of equipment without receiving collateral for such payments. As a result, the Company’s claims for such payments would rank only as an unsecured claim, which exposes the Company to the credit risks of the equipment suppliers.
 
(d) 	Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as with respect to the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the allocation of the purchase price for the Company’s acquisitions of minority interest in Tianwei Yingli, the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangibles with definite lives, recoverability of the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, the fair value of share-based payments, allowances for doubtful receivables,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
realizable value of inventories, realizability of deferred income tax assets, the fair value of financial and equity instruments and warranty obligations. Actual results could differ from estimates.
 
(e) 	Foreign Currency
 
The Company’s reporting currency is the Renminbi (“RMB”). The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC is the RMB as the PRC is the primary economic environment in which these entities operate.
 
The functional currency of Yingli Green Energy is the US dollar (“US$”), since US$ is the currency in which Yingli Green Energy primarily generates and expends cash. Assets, liabilities and Series A and B redeemable convertible preferred shares of Yingli Green Energy are translated into RMB, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues, if any, and expenses are translated into the RMB at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting from translation of US$ financial statements of Yingli Green Energy to the Company’s reporting currency of the RMB are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholder’s equity.
 
For the convenience of readers, certain 2006 RMB amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB 7.4928, being the noon buy rate for U.S. dollars in effect on September 28, 2007 in the City of New York for cable transfer in RMB per U.S. dollar as certified for custom purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank. No representation is made that RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars at that rate or at any other certain rate on September 28, 3007, or at any other date.
 
(f) 	Cash and Restricted Cash
 
Cash consists of cash on hand, cash in bank accounts, and interest bearing savings accounts. As of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006 all of the Company’s cash is held in major financial institutions located in the PRC and Hong Kong, which management believes are of high quality.
 
Restricted cash of RMB 726,733, RMB 14,870,469, RMB 8,862,462 and RMB 16,105,056 (US$2,149,404) as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively, represents bank deposits for securing letters of credit and letters of guarantee granted to the Company, primarily for the purchase of inventory. Such letters of credit and letters of guarantee expire within 1 to 3 months. The remaining restricted cash of RMB 305,675,251 (US$40,795,864) as of December 31, 2006 represents the portion of cash proceeds from the issuance of mandatory redeemable and convertible bonds and Series B redeemable convertible preferred shares that are held in interest bearing bank deposit accounts. Based on the terms of the respective financing arrangements, such amount can only be used for additional capital contributions in Tianwei Yingli (which the Company is in the process of obtaining relevant PRC regulatory approval) and interest payments on the Company’s mandatory redeemable and convertible bonds payable to Yingli Power.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
(g) 	Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts and aging data. Judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable balances based on historical collection experience, customer specific facts and current economic conditions. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
 
(h) 	Inventories
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by using the weighted average cost method. Cost of work-in-progress and finished goods are comprised of direct materials, direct labor, and related manufacturing overhead based on normal operating capacity. Adjustments are recorded to write down the carrying amount of obsolete and excess inventory to its estimated net realizable value based on historical and forecasted demand.
 
(i) 	Prepayments to Suppliers
 
Advance payments for the future delivery of polysilicon are made based on written purchase orders detailing product, quantity and price and are classified as “prepayments to suppliers” in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s supply contracts grant the Company the right to inspect products prior to acceptance. The outstanding balance of the “prepayments to suppliers” is reduced and reclassified to “inventories” when inventory is received and passes quality inspection based on the terms of the purchase order. Such reclassifications of RMB 5,169,299, RMB 12,037,615, RMB 70,679,259 (US$9,432,957) and RMB 152,431,193 (US$20,343,689) for the years ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, the period January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006 and the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006, respectively are not reflected as cash outflows from operating activities. Prepayments to suppliers expected to be utilized within twelve months as of each balance sheet date are recorded as current “prepayments to suppliers” in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006, prepayments to suppliers of RMB 226,273,660 (US$30,198,812) representing the portion expected to be utilized after twelve months have been classified as “long-term prepayments to suppliers” in the consolidated balance sheet and relate to prepayments to one supplier for two long-term supply agreements with deliveries not scheduled to commerce until 2009.
 
(j) 	Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or relative fair value at the date of acquisition. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the asset, taking into consideration any estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds received thereon. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses as incurred,

and replacements and betterments are capitalized. The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
 
 	 	 	 	 
Buildings	 	 	30 years	 
Machinery	 	 	8-10 years	 
Electronic equipment	 	 	4-5 years	 
Furniture and fixtures	 	 	4-5 years	 
Motor vehicles	 	 	8-10 years	 
 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment attributable to manufacturing activities is capitalized as part of the cost of inventory production, and expensed to cost of revenues when the inventory is sold.
 
Cost incurred in the construction of new facilities, including progress payments and deposits, interest and other costs relating to the construction, are capitalized and transferred out of construction in progress and into their respective asset categories when the assets are ready for their intended use, at which time depreciation commences.
 
(k) 	Land Use Rights
 
Land use rights represent the cost of land use rights in the PRC. Land use rights are carried at cost and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the respective periods of the rights of 45-50 years.
 
(l) 	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of the proportional net assets acquired from the acquisitions of additional equity interest in Tianwei Yingli (note 23). Goodwill and trademarks, which have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually.
 
Intangible assets, other than trademarks, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The Company’s amortizable intangible assets consist of technical know-how, customer relationships, order backlog and short-term and long-term supplies agreements with the following estimated useful lives:
 
 	 	 
Technical know-how
 	6 years
Customer relationships
 	6 years
Order backlog
 	1.5 years
Short-term supply agreements
 	0.5 years
Long-term supply agreements
 	5 and 9 years starting from 2009
 
Long-term supply agreements relate to two long-term polysilicon supply agreements with delivery period commencing in 2009. The intangible asset in connection with these two agreements will be amortized over the delivery period of 5 and 9 years, commencing in 2009.

(m) 	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet.
 
Goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment, and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. For intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. For goodwill, the impairment determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.
 
(n) 	Investment in and Advances to An Affiliate
 
Investments in entities where the Company does not have a controlling financial interest, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company’s share of the investee’s results of operations is included in other income (expense).
 
The Company recognizes a loss when there is a loss in value of equity method investment which is other than a temporary decline. The process of assessing and determining whether impairment on a particular equity investment is other than temporary requires a significant amount of judgment. To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the decline in value, any change in value subsequent to year-end, and forecasted performance of the investee. Based on the Company’s evaluation, there was no impairment charge related to its investment in an affiliate for all periods presented.
 
(o) 	Statutory Reserves
 
In accordance with PRC Company Law, Tianwei Yingli is required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely a statutory surplus reserve and a statutory public welfare reserve which are

Table of Contents

YINGLI GREEN ENERGY HOLDING COMPANY LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARY
 
AND
 
BAODING TIANWEI YINGLI NEW ENERGY RESOURCES CO., LTD AND SUBSIDIARY
(“Predecessor”)
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
appropriated from net profits. Prior to September 5, 2006, as a domestic limited liability company, Tianwei Yingli was required to allocate at least 10% of its after tax profits to a statutory surplus reserve with the right to discontinue allocations to the statutory surplus reserve if such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. Tianwei Yingli also appropriated 5% of the profit to the statutory public welfare reserve. All statutory reserves are required to be calculated based on amounts reported in Tianwei Yingli’s PRC statutory financial statements. Effective from September 5, 2006, as a result of the Reorganization, Tianwei Yingli became a foreign invested enterprise (“FIE”). Tianwei Yingli, as a FIE, is required to provide for reserve fund, employee fund and welfare funds and enterprise development fund each at a percentage, which is a discretionary percentage and is decided by the Tianwei Yingli’s board of directors each calendar year. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends.
 
As of December 31, 2006, Tianwei Yingli had appropriated RMB 14,376,864 (US$1,918,757) in statutory reserves, which, although are restricted from being distributed to Yingli Green Energy, have no impact on presentation of the Company’s retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet.
 
(p) 	Share-based Payment
 
The Company applied SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) for share based payments made in the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the costs over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005 and the period January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006, the Company did not enter into any share-based payment arrangements.
 
(q) 	Revenue Recognition
 
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred or the service has been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. These criteria as they relate to the sale of the Company’s products or services are as follows:
 
For sales of PV modules to foreign customers, delivery of the products occurs at the point in time the product is delivered to the named port of shipment, which is when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. For sales of PV modules to domestic customers, delivery of the product occurs at the point in time the product is received by the customer, which is when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
 
Sales of PV systems consist of the delivery, assembly and installation of PV modules, related power electronics and other components. The Company considers the PV system to be delivered, and the risks and rewards of ownership transferred, when installation of all components is complete and customer acceptance is received. Customer acceptance is evidenced by a signed project acceptance document. The assembly and installation of PV systems is short, generally lasting between 1 to 3 months, and requires advance payments from the customer.

AND

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Other revenue consists primarily of the sale of raw materials and the processing of PV cells into PV modules for third-party vendors. Revenue for the processing of PV cells into PV modules is recognized at the time when the processing is completed and the PV modules are received by the customer. Delivery for the sale of raw materials occurs at the point in time the product is received by the customer, which is when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
 
For all sales and services, the Company requires a contract or purchase order which quantifies pricing, quantity and product specifications. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenues, with the related shipping or delivery costs recorded as cost of revenues.
 
Advance payments received from customers for the future sale of inventory are recognized as advances from customers in the consolidated balance sheets. Advances from customers are recognized as revenues when the conditions for revenue recognition described above have been satisfied. Advances from customers have been recognized as a current liability because the amount at each balance sheet date is expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months.
 
In the PRC, value added tax (“VAT”) at a general rate of 17% on invoice amount is collected on behalf of tax authorities in respect of the sales of product and services and is not recorded as revenue. VAT collected from customers, net of VAT paid for purchases, is recorded as a liability until it is paid to the tax authorities. Prior to September 5, 2006, Tianwei Yingli and its subsidiary, Chengdu Yingli were subject to city construction tax and education surcharge at rates of 7% and 4%, respectively, of net value added tax payable. Commencing on September 5, 2006, as a result of Tianwei Yingli’s change in tax status to a foreign invested enterprise, Tianwei Yingli is no longer subject to the city construction tax and education surcharge. Chengdu Yingli, as a domestic company, continues to be subject to such tax and surcharge. In the accompanying consolidated statements of income, city construction tax and education surcharge of RMB 8,242, RMB 2,987,288, RMB 11,357,591 (US$1,515,801) and RMB 4,208 (US$562) are deducted to arrive at net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, the period January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006 and the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006, respectively.
 
(r) 	Research and Development and Government Grant
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
 
The Company is a party to research grant contracts with the PRC government under which the Company receives funds in advance for specified costs incurred in certain research projects. The Company records such amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses when the related research and development costs are incurred. The Company has recorded grant proceeds of RMB 200,000, RMB 1,550,000, RMB 600,000 (US$80,077) and RMB 400,000 (US$53,385) as a reduction to research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the period January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006 and the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006, respectively.
 
(s) 	Warranty Cost
 
The Company’s PV modules are typically sold with a two-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a 10-year and 25-year warranty against declines of more than 10.0% and 20.0% of initial power generation capacity, respectively. As a result, the Company bears the risk

AND

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
of warranty claims long after the Company has sold its products and recognized revenues. The Company has sold PV modules only since January 2003, and none of the Company’s PV modules has been in use for more than four years. In connection with the Company’s PV system sales in the PRC, the Company provides a one- to five-year warranty against defects in the Company’s modules, storage batteries, controllers and inverters. The Company performs industry-standard testing to test the quality, durability and safety of the Company’s products. As a result of such tests, management believes the quality, durability and safety of its products are within industry norms. Management’s estimate of the amount of its warranty obligation is based on the results of these tests and consideration given to the warranty accrual practice of other companies in the same business. Consequently, the Company accrues the equivalent of 1% of net revenues as a warranty liability to accrue the estimated cost of its warranty obligations.
 
Actual warranty costs are charged against the accrued warranty liability. To the extent that actual warranty costs differ significantly from estimates, the Company will revise its warranty provisions accordingly.
 
Changes in the carrying amount of accrued product warranty are as follows:

(t) 	Income Taxes
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and any tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and

liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
(u) 	Commitments and Contingencies
 
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
 
The Company is exposed to risks associated with product liability claims in the event that the use of the PV products the Company sells results in injury. The Company does not maintain any third-party liability insurance coverage other than limited product liability insurance or any insurance coverage for business interruption. As a result, the Company may have to pay for financial and other losses, damages and liabilities, including, those in connection with or resulting from third-party product liability claims and those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond the Company’s control, out of its own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial conditions and results of operation.
 
(v) 	Segment Reporting
 
The Company has no operating segments, as that term is defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 131 Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Geographic revenue information is presented in note 24.
 
(w) 	Earnings Per Share
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Computation of Earnings Per Share” (“SFAS No. 128”) and EITF Issue 03-06, “Participating Securities and the Two — Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128” (“EITF Issue No. 03-06”), basic earnings per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income allocated to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006 using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and other participating securities based on dividends declared (or accumulated) and participating rights in undistributed earnings. The Company’s Series A and Series B redeemable convertible preferred shares (note 17) are participating securities since the holders of these securities may participate in dividends with ordinary shareholder(s) based on a pre-determined formula. EITF Issue No. 03-06 does not require the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share for securities other than ordinary shares; therefore the basic earnings per share amounts presented only pertain to the Company’s ordinary shares.
 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholder as adjusted for the effect of dilutive ordinary equivalent shares, if any, by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the year. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the ordinary shares issuable upon the conversion of the Series A and B redeemable convertible preferred shares and mandatory convertible bonds (using the if-converted method) and ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share options and

warrants (using the treasury stock method). Potential dilutive securities are not included in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share if the impact is anti-dilutive.
 
Tianwei Yingli is not a share-based company and had no outstanding shares for the periods presented, and therefore, no earnings per share data for Tianwei Yingli has been presented.
 
(x) 	Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48)
 
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 establishes the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax-return positions in the consolidated financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority, and prescribes a measurement methodology for those positions meeting the recognition threshold. FIN 48 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2007. Management does not believe the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 155
 
In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments — an amendment of FASB Statements 133 and 140, or SFAS No. 155. SFAS No. 155 improves financial reporting by eliminating the exemption from applying SFAS No. 133 to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of the form of the instruments. SFAS No. 155 also improves financial reporting by allowing a preparer to elect fair value measurement at acquisition, at issuance, or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a re-measurement event, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, in cases in which a derivative would otherwise have to bifurcated, if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2007. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 157
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement or SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 addresses standardizing the measurement of fair value for companies that are required to use a fair value measure of recognition for recognition or disclosure purposes. The FASB defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measure date.” SFAS No. 157 is effective for the year for the Company on January 1, 2008. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

As part of its ongoing control procedures, management monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Credit terms are normally 7 to 10 days from the date of billing. For certain customers the Company requires an advance payment before the sale is made. Such advance payments are reported as “advances from customers” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and amounted to RMB 1,883,464, RMB 27,874,404, RMB 174,681,305 and RMB 113,637,769 (US$15,166,262) as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The Company also requires certain customers to secure payment by a letter of credit issued by the customers’ banks. Letters of credit have terms ranging from 1 to 3 months. Until the letter of credit is drawn and the amount is paid, the amount due from the customer is recorded as accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006, 64%, 92%,

(7)  	Land Use Rights
 
In April 2006, the Company obtained approval from Hebei Province municipal government to acquire the right to use the land on which the Company will construct a 500 million watt PV module plant, national PV engineering center, PV research and development center and a training center. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company was obligated to pay approximately RMB 75,985,500 to obtain the right to use the land for a period of 50 years. In June 2006, the Company commenced its construction project on the land and recorded the land use right asset and corresponding liability at the estimated acquisition price of RMB 75,985,500. On December 22, 2006, the Company renegotiated the acquisition price with the government and paid a revised amount of RMB 39,697,276 for the land use right. Accordingly, the Company revised the previous recorded amount of land use right to reflect the final acquisition price. The Company obtained the land use right certificate on February 15, 2007.
 
(8)  	Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, current amounts due from related parties, accounts payable, borrowings from related parties, short-term borrowing, advances from customers, and other amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values due to their short term nature.
 
The fair value of the long-term portion of amounts due from related parties as of December 31, 2004 is RMB 7,517,828 and is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using the interest rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and remaining estimated maturities.
 
The estimated fair value of mandatory redeemable bonds and the mandatory convertible bonds was RMB 299,359,827 (US$39,952,998) (carrying value RMB 293,109,511 (US$39,118,822)) and

RMB 370,260,838 (US$49,415,551) (carrying value RMB 362,530,181 (US$48,383,806)), respectively as of December 31, 2006 and was based on the present value of cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates current market returns for issues of similar debt instruments issued to comparable holders in the same geographic area.
 
There is no quoted market price for the Company’s investment in its affiliate (note 9). Accordingly, a reasonable estimate of fair value could not be made without incurring excessive costs.
 
(9)  	Investment in and Advances to an Affiliate
 
The Company acquired a 10% equity interest in Tibet Tianwei Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd. (“Tibetan Yingli”) in December 2003 for RMB 4,000,000. On September 15, 2005, the Company acquired an additional 40% equity interest for RMB 8,000,000 and obtained the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Tibetan Yingli. The purchase price approximated 40% of the fair value of Tibetan Yingli’s net assets. Consequently, no investor level goodwill was recognized. The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect the Company’s investment in Tibetan Yingli on the equity method of accounting, which was applied retrospectively to the beginning of 2004.
 
As of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006, the Company’s advances to Tibetan Yingli were nil, RMB 1,080,900, RMB 4,828,035 and RMB 2,399,910, (US$320,295) respectively, to assist Tibetan Yingli in supporting their operating activities. During the period from August 7, 2006 through December 31, 2006, pursuant to the approval of the Board of Tibetan Yingli, advances of RMB 8,000,000 (US$1,067,692) to Tibetan Yingli were settled by reducing the Company’s RMB 8,000,000 (US$1,067,692) purchase price payable to Tibetan Yingli. The settlement of the advance and corresponding payable was reflected as a non-cash transaction in the consolidated statements of cash flow.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
December 31, 2006, Yingli Group entrusted a loan of RMB 125,000,000 (US$16,682,682) from Agricultural Bank of China to Tianwei Yingli, of which RMB 124,000,000 (US$16,549,221) was repaid during the same period.
 
The loan from customer of RMB 30,000,000 held as of December 31, 2005, was unsecured, had no specific repayment terms, bore interest at a rate of 5.58% per annum, and was repaid on March 20, 2006. The loan from the governmental authority of RMB 12,000,000 is unsecured, bears interest at a rate of 7.67% guaranteed by Tianwei Baobian and was past due on July 18, 2005 and therefore, payable on demand. Loans from other third-party borrowings were personally arranged by the Company’s related parties and were interest-free and unsecured. During the year ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, the period January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006 and the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006, the Company obtained loans from other third parties of nil, RMB 25,715,509, RMB 5,000,000 (US$667,307), and nil and repaid loans to other third parties of nil, nil, RMB 20,715,509 (US$2,764,722), and RMB 10,000,000 (US$1,334,615), respectively. The Company’s interest free loans have no specific due dates and were issued solely for cash and no other rights or privileges were exchanged, and therefore no interest has been imputed.
 
In August 2005, the Company negotiated an agreement with the holder of the Company’s overdue bank loan secured by the land use right and property, plant and equipment. The holder of the Company’s loan had acquired the Company’s loan from a financial institution at a discount from the face value of the loan. At that time the total amount outstanding was RMB 12,964,688, of which RMB 12,000,000 represented principal (the face value) and the remainder represented accrued interest payable. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company paid RMB 10,800,000 as payment in full for the loan and interest. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of RMB 2,164,688 on extinguishment of debt in 2005.
 
(11)  	Convertible Loan
 
In May 2006, Tianwei Yingli issued a RMB 85,635,000 (US$11,428,972) convertible loan due on May 17, 2007 to China Foreign Economics and Trade & Investment Co., Ltd., or FOTIC, who held the loan as a nominee for certain third parties (the “Third Party Investors”). The loan was issued at par and bore interest at 8% payable at maturity. The loan was convertible into ordinary shares of Tianwei Yingli at a conversion price equal to Tianwei Yingli’s per share market value as determined by a future private placement of Tianwei Yingli’s equity and agreed upon by both parties.
 
On December 29, 2006, Tianwei Yingli, FOTIC, China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd. (an entity designated by the Third Party Investors) and Yingli Green Energy entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the Company repaid the convertible loan plus accrued interest of RMB 4,281,750 (US$571,449) and issued warrant to China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd. to purchase 2,068,252 of Yingli Green Energy’s ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$4.835 per share. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of RMB 3,908,381 (US$521,618) translated at the historical rate, representing the difference between the consideration paid (cash paid plus the fair value of warrant) and the carrying value of the convertible loan and accrued interest on the date the debt was extinguished. China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd. exercised the warrant on February 2, 2007.

(13)  	Mandatory Convertible and Redeemable Bonds Payable to Yingli Power
 
On November 13, 2006, Yingli Power, the Company’s controlling shareholder and an entity wholly owned by Mr. Liansheng Miao, issued US$85 million floating rate Notes (“the Notes”) at 98.75% of face value to Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch (“Deutsche Bank”). The Notes consisted of two portions, US$55 million in mandatory redeemable notes (“Mandatory Redeemable Notes”) and US$30 million in mandatory exchangeable notes (“Mandatory Exchangeable Notes”). Upon the IPO, the Mandatory Exchangeable Notes convert into the number of the Company’s ordinary shares equivalent to 3.73% effective equity interests in Tianwei Yingli on a fully diluted basis. Such shares will be delivered by Yingli Power. The effective conversion price is subject to certain adjustments based on Tianwei Yingli’s 2006 net income or the Company’s IPO offering price. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Yingli Power issued a warrant to Deutsche Bank, which is exercisable into 6.5% of the Company’s ordinary shares held by Yingli Power. The warrant is only exercisable if the Company repays the loan, under its early redemption rights and the Company completes it IPO. The exercise price of this warrant is the lower of (i) 25 times Tianwei Yingli’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, multiplied by the Company’s ownership percentage in Tianwei Yingli and divided by the total number of the Company’s outstanding ordinary shares on fully diluted basis and (ii) 67.5% of offering price of the Company’s ordinary shares in a public offering and listing of such shares in an international stock exchange. The warrant is exercisable upon any listing of the Company’s ordinary shares, which occurs after the Notes have been repaid in full.
 
In connection with Yingli Power’s issuance of the Notes, the Company issued US$85,000,000 in interest-bearing Bonds (“the Bonds”) to Yingli Power at 98.95% of face value. The Bonds consisted of two portions, US$38 million in mandatory redeemable bonds (“Mandatory Redeemable Bonds”) and US$47 million in mandatory convertible bonds (“Mandatory Convertible Bonds”). Upon the IPO, the Mandatory Convertible Bonds convert into the number of the Company’s ordinary shares equivalent to 3.73% effective equity interests in Tianwei Yingli on a fully diluted basis. Such shares will be newly issued by the Company and delivered to Yingli Power. The terms of the Notes and Bonds are substantially the same, other than the portion of the amount that is convertible into the Company’s ordinary shares. Yingli Power used the cash proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to purchase the Bonds issued by Yingli Green Energy.
 
The Company has determined that the conversion feature embedded in the Mandatory Convertible Bonds is not required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative pursuant to SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”) , since the terms of conversion do not require or permit net settlement, provide for a means for the conversion feature to be settled outside the contract, or provide for delivery of an asset which would put the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Bond in a position substantially similar to a net settlement provision. The Company has also determined that the non-detachable convertible feature had no intrinsic value on the commitment date based on the conversion price paid by Deutsche Bank, an unrelated third-party investor. Therefore, no beneficial conversion feature was recognized. Since the ultimate number of shares to be issued upon conversion is contingent, the Company will determine whether the conversion feature has intrinsic value when the number of shares to be issued is known and the conversion contingency is resolved.
 
Direct and incremental cost of issuing the Bonds of RMB 2,351,259 (US$313,802) were charged against the proceeds and recorded as a discount to the Bonds’ issuance price or carrying value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Both the Bonds and the Notes are due at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on November 16, 2008. Both the Bonds and Notes bear interest from November 16, 2006, payable quarterly at an interest rate equal to the British Bankers Association Interest Settlement Rate plus 2% per annum for the period ending prior to August 17, 2007 and plus 4% per annum thereafter.
 
The Company has the right to early redeem the Bonds and correspondingly, Yingli Power has the right to early redeem the Notes at any time in whole, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds or Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
Under both the Bonds and Notes agreements, the Company is subject to a number of covenants, such as the maintenance of certain financial ratios commencing on the quarter ended June 30, 2007, restrictions on granting collateral, disposal of existing assets, making payments to shareholder and affiliates and making investments. The Company has also pledged to Yingli Power all of its current and future equity interest in Tianwei Yingli as collateral under these bonds, correspondingly, Yingli Power has pledged all of its current and future equity in the Company as collateral under these notes.
 
(14)  	Employee Benefit Plans
 
Pursuant to the relevant PRC regulations, the Company is required to make contributions for each employee at a rate of 20% on a standard salary base as determined by the local Social Security Bureau, to a defined contribution retirement program organized by the local Social Security Bureau. In addition, the Company is also required by pursuant to the relevant PRC regulations to make contributions for each employee at a rate of 7.5%, 2% and 2% of standard salary base for medical insurance benefits, unemployment and other statutory benefits, respectively.

(15)  	Income Taxes
 
Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, Yingli Green Energy is not subject to tax on its income or capital gains. In addition, upon any payment or dividend by Yingli Green Energy, no withholding tax is imposed.
 
Yingli Green Energy’s operating subsidiary, being incorporated in the PRC, is governed by the income tax law of the PRC and is generally subject to the PRC enterprise income tax rate of 33%, consisting of 30% state tax and 3% local tax. Prior to September 5, 2006, for tax purposes Tianwei Yingli was considered a domestic enterprise. In addition, Tianwei Yingli qualified as a “high and new technology enterprise” and was entitled to a preferential PRC enterprise income tax rate of 15%, consisting of 15% state tax and nil local tax. As part of the Reorganization described in Note 1, Tianwei Yingli’s tax status changed to a foreign invested enterprise Tianwei Yingli maintained its “high and new technology enterprise” status. As a result Tianwei Yingli’s tax rate remained at 15% however its local tax rate was increased to 3%.
 
Following its conversion into a foreign invested enterprise, Tianwei Yingli is entitled to an exemption from the enterprise state income tax for its first two profitable years and a 50% reduction in the enterprise income state tax rate in the subsequent three years, In addition, Tianwei Yingli is also

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible or utilized, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, no valuation allowance has been provided against deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005, September 4, 2006 and December 31, 2006. The amount of the deferred income tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.
 
On March 16, 2007, the PRC government enacted the new Enterprise Income Tax Law which imposes a single income tax rate of 25% for most domestic enterprises and foreign investment enterprises. The Enterprise Income Tax Law is effective as of January 1, 2008 and may result in

higher income taxes to the Company in the future. The impact of the changes in tax rates on the Company’s deferred tax balances, if any, will be recognized in 2007, the period the new enterprise income tax rate is enacted.
 
(16)  	Share-Based Compensation
 
Stock Option and Stock Issuance Plan
 
On December 28, 2006, the Company adopted the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for both the granting of stock options and other stock-based awards such as restricted shares to key employees, directors and consultants of the Company. The Board of Directors and shareholders authorized and reserved for the issuance of up to 3,394,054 ordinary shares under the Plan. Among these shares, 2,715,243 shares may be issued for the purpose of granting awards of restricted shares and up to 678,811 shares may be issued for the purpose of granting options. Stock options granted become exercisable over four years. The Company expects to issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options.
 
On December 28, 2006, the Board of Directors granted options to purchase an aggregate of 610,929 ordinary shares to four executive officers at an exercise price of US$2.10 per share with a contractual term of ten years and vesting period of four years. The fair value of the Company’s ordinary shares and intrinsic value per option on December 28, 2006 was US$4.74 (RMB 37.04) per share and US$2.64 (RMB 20.63), respectively. The Company did not grant any options during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, and for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006.
 
The Company has accounted for these options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R by recognizing compensation cost based on the grant-date fair value over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The amount of compensation cost recognized for these share options was US$7,826 (RMB 61,667) for the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006, which was charged to general and administrative expenses.
 
The option fair value of US$3.81 (RMB 29.77) per share or an aggregate of RMB 18,200,902 (US$2,429,119), on the date of grant was determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following assumptions:
 
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	December 28, 2006
 
Expected volatility
 	 	70%	 
Expected dividends yield
 	 	0%	 
Expected term
 	 	6.3 years	 
Risk-free interest rate (per annum)
 	 	5.13%	 
Estimated fair value of underlying ordinary shares (per share)
 	 	US$4.74	 
 
The expected volatility of 70% was based on the average volatility of several listed comparable companies in the solar products manufactory industry. Since the Company did not have a trading history at the time the options were issued, the Company estimated the potential volatility of its ordinary share price by referring to the latest six year average volatility of these comparable companies because management believes that the average volatility of such companies was a reasonable benchmark to use in estimating the expected volatility of the Company’s ordinary shares.

The estimated fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date of the above grant was determined by management based on a contemporaneous valuation performed by American Appraisal China Limited (“American Appraisal”), an unrelated and independent valuation firm, as indicated in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007.
 
No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 and during the period January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006. The only option activity during the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006 was a grant of 610,929 options on December 28, 2006 and is summarized as follows:

As of December 31, 2006 there was RMB 18,139,235 (US$2,420,889) total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share options, which were all issued on December 28, 2006. This cost is expected to be recognized on a straight line basis over the next four years.
 
(17)  	Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares
 
On September 28, 2006, the Company issued 8,081,081 Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares (“Series A Preferred Shares”) to Inspiration Partner Limited for an aggregate purchase price of US$17,010,000 (RMB 134,526,987) or US$2.10 per Series A Preferred Share. In conjunction with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Shares, the Company issued TB Management Ltd., an affiliate of Inspiration Partner Limited, a warrant to purchase 678,811 of ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$2.10 per share (“Series A Warrant”). The Series A Warrant is exercisable at anytime prior to the Company’s initial public offering. As of December 31, 2006, the Series A Warrant had not been exercised.
 
The Series A Warrant and Series A Preferred Shares were recorded at their relative fair value of US$211,341 (RMB 1,671,432) and US$16,798,659 (RMB 132,855,555), respectively, in aggregate or US$0.31 (RMB 2.43) and US$2.08 (RMB 16.23), respectively, on a per share basis. The relative fair value of the Series A Warrant was recorded as a discount to the issuance price of the Series A Preferred Shares and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. The Company has

determined that there was no embedded beneficial conversion feature attributable to the Series A Preferred Shares at the commitment date, since US$2.08, the effective conversion price of each of the Series A Preferred Shares, was greater than US$2.04, the fair value of each of the Company’s ordinary shares. The estimated fair value of the underlying Series A preferred shares at the commitment date was determined by management based on a retrospective valuation also performed by American Appraisal, as indicated in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007, supplemented by the forecasted profitability and cash flows of the Company’s business. The fair value of the Series A Warrant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility rate of 58%, risk-free interest rate of 5.04%, exercise price of US$2.10, and an expected term of 0.59 years. The estimated fair values of the Series A Preferred Shares and underlying ordinary shares at the commitment date was determined by management based on a retrospective valuation also performed by American Appraisal, as indicated in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007, supplemented by the forecasted profitability and cash flows of the Company’s business.
 
The Series A Preferred Shares are redeemable for cash at the option of the majority of the holders at any time after September 28, 2009, at a redemption price of US$22,133,600 equal to the Series A Preferred Shares issuance price plus 12% per annum. Consequently, the Series A Preferred Shares are classified outside of permanent equity of the Company. The accretion from Series A Preferred Share’s initial carrying value of US$16,748,659 to the Series A Preferred Shares’ redemption value of US$23,133,600 is reflected as a reduction to earnings to arrive at net income applicable to ordinary shareholder in the accompanying consolidated statement of income and amounted to US$475,932 for the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006.
 
On December 13, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement to issue 24,405,377 Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares (“Series B Preferred Shares”) to Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, an affiliate of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, and 13 other investors for an aggregate purchase price of US$118,000,000 (RMB 922,736,400) or US$4.835 per Series B Preferred Share. As of December 31, 2006, the Company issued 23,474,663 shares of Series B preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of US$113,500,000 (RMB 887,547,300). Of the US$113,500,000, US$20,000,000 was received prior to the issuance date as advance payments. The Company used US$17,000,000 of the advanced payments to increase its equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to 53.98% from 51% (Note 23).
 
In conjunction with the issuance of Series B Preferred Shares, the Company issued warrants to purchase 2,112,057 of ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$0.01 per share (the Series B Warrant) to investors who did not make advance payments. The Series B Warrant is exercisable at any time after April 30, 2007 or such later date on which the Series B Preferred shareholders agree and prior to the earlier of (a) the closing of the Company’s qualified initial public offering or (b) the conversion of the full amount of the principal of US$78,400,000 (RMB 612,856,640), and accrued interest of a shareholder loan that Yingli Green Energy provided to Tianwei Yingli with the proceeds funded from the Series B Preferred Shares into Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital (the “Shareholder Loan”). The Series B Warrant is not transferable and is subject to certain cancellation and return features. Upon the conversion of the Shareholder Loan any unexercised Series B Warrants will be automatically cancelled and the Series B preferred shareholders are obligated to return any shares issued under the exercise of the warrants. If the Series B preferred shareholders have sold their ordinary shares issued under the exercise of the warrants, then the Series B preferred shareholders

will pay the Company an amount to be mutually determined between the Company and such Series B preferred shareholders.
 
For Series B Preferred Shares that were issued with warrants, the Series B Warrant and Series B Preferred Shares were recorded at their relative fair value of US$850,482 (RMB 6,650,603) and US$92,649,512 (RMB 724,500,650), respectively, in aggregate or US$0.42 (RMB 3.30) and US$4.79 (RMB 37.46), respectively, on a per share basis. The relative fair value of the Series B Warrant was recorded as a discount to the issuance price of the Series B Preferred Share and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. The Company has determined that there was no embedded beneficial conversion feature attributable to the Series B Preferred Shares that were issued with warrants at the commitment date, since US$4.79, the effective conversion price of the Series B Preferred Shares, was greater than US$4.74, the fair value of the Company’s ordinary shares. The estimated fair value of the underlying Series B preferred shares at the commitment date was determined by management based on a contemporaneous valuation also performed by American Appraisal, as indicated in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007, supplemented by the forecasted profitability and cash flows of the Company’s business. The relative fair value of the Series B Warrant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility rate of 47%, risk-free interest rate of 5.05% and expected term of 0.3 years. The resulting amount was then discounted by 90% to take into account management’s estimation and probability of the warrants not being exercised since the warrants are automatically cancelled upon the conversion of the Shareholder Loan into Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital. The estimated fair values of the Series B Preferred Shares and underlying ordinary shares at the commitment date was also determined by management based on a contemporaneous valuation also performed by American Appraisal, as indicated in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007, supplemented by the forecasted profitability and cash flows of the Company’s business.
 
Further, the Company has determined that there was no embedded beneficial conversion feature attributable to the Series B Preferred Shares that were issued without warrants at the commitment date, since US$4.835, the initial conversion price of the Series B Preferred Shares, was greater than US$4.74, the fair value of the Company’s ordinary shares.
 
The Series B Preferred Shares are redeemable for cash at the option of the majority of the holders at any time after September 28, 2009, at a redemption price of US$154,360,000 (RMB 1,205,350,932) equal to the Series B Preferred Shares issuance price plus 12% per annum. Consequently, the Series B Preferred Shares are classified outside of permanent equity of the Company as of December 31, 2006. The accretion from Series B Preferred Share’s initial carrying value of US$112,649,514 (RMB 880,896,663) to Series B Preferred Share’s redemption value of US$154,360,000 (RMB 1,205,350,932) is reflected as a reduction to earnings to arrive at net income applicable to ordinary shareholder in the accompanying consolidated statement of income and amounted to US$408,469 (RMB 3,218,654) for the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006.
 
One customer, with sales that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net revenue, during the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006, purchased 2,068,252 Series B Preferred Shares.

The holders of Preferred Shares have various rights and preferences as follows:
 
Voting
 
The holders have the right to one vote for each share of ordinary shares into which such shares can be converted at the voting date.
 
Dividends
 
Holders of the preferred shares are entitled to participate in dividends at the same rate per share as the ordinary shares, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the ordinary shares, when and if declared by the Board of Directors. No dividends on preferred and ordinary shares have been declared since the issuance date through December 31, 2006.
 
Liquidation
 
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the holders of preferred shares shall be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to 100% of the original issue plus all dividends accrued, or declared and unpaid. If the assets and funds distributed among the holders are insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the preferred shares in proportion to their full preferential amounts. After payment of the full amounts from above, the remaining assets of the Company available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of preferred shares and ordinary shares in proportion to the number of outstanding shares hold by each such holder.
 
Conversion
 
Each share of preferred share is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time after the date of issuance of such share for such preferred share according to a conversion ratio, subject to adjustment for dilution. Each share of preferred share shall be convertible into the number of shares of ordinary shares determined by dividing the applicable original issuance price by the conversion price. At December 31, 2006, each share of preferred share is convertible into one ordinary share.
 
Each share of preferred share automatically converts into the number of shares of ordinary share into which such shares are convertible upon the earlier of any of the following events: (i) affirmative election of the holders of a majority of the preferred shares then outstanding, voting

together as a single class, or (ii) the closing of a first firm commitment underwritten public offering of ordinary shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of at least US$100 million and a total market capitalization of at least US$750 million.
 
At December 31, 2006, the Company had reserved 32,486,458 shares of ordinary shares for the conversion of the preferred shares.
 
Purchase price adjustment
 
If Tianwei Yingli does not reach a certain level of Net Income (defined as consolidated profit after taxes, excluding any non-recurring or extraordinary items and adding back stock option charges, as reported in accordance with US GAAP) in 2006 and 2007, Yingli Power, the Company’s controlling shareholder, will transfer to the Series A and B Preferred Shareholder ordinary shares of the Company that Yingli Power holds pursuant to a pre-determined formula. The Company has agreed to convert such certain number of shares into Series A and B Preferred Shares at a ratio of 1 to 1. Management believes Tianwei Yingli met its 2006 Net Income target and as a result there was no purchase price adjustment in 2006. The 2007 purchase price adjustment will be waived if the Preferred Shares are converted to ordinary shares before the 2007 Net Income becomes available.
 
(18)  	Ordinary Shares
 
The Company’s Article of Associations, as amended on December 20, 2006, authorizes the Company to issue 967,513,542 shares of US$0.01 par value ordinary shares. As part of the Reorganization described in Note 1, on August 7, 2006, Yingli Power subscribed for 50,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares at par value of US$0.01 per share. On September 25, 2006, Yingli Power subscribed for an additional 9,800,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares for cash consideration of US$100,000.

Basic and diluted earnings per share
 
Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128 and EITF Issue No. 03-06 for the year ended December 31, 2006 as follows:

Net income, after deducting accretion to holders of preferred shareholders, has been allocated to the ordinary share and preferred shares based on their respective rights to share in dividends.
 
The computation of diluted income per share for the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006, did not assume conversion of the Series A and B Preferred Shares because, when applying the if-converted method, the effect of the ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of Series A and B Preferred Shares, including the maximum number of 31,555,744 shares issuable under the conversion terms of the Series A and B Preferred Shares agreement as described in note 17, was anti-dilutive. The conversion of the Series A and B Preferred Shares was anti-dilutive because the amount of the accretion to the Series A and B Preferred Shares redemption value for the period per ordinary share obtainable upon conversion on a weighted average outstanding basis exceeded basic earnings per share.
 
Potential dilutive securities also consisted of 5,458,768 ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of Mandatory Convertible Bonds payable to Yingli Power, 610,929 shares issuable upon the exercise of employee stock options and 2,068,252 ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase the Company’s shares as described in note 11.

share obtainable upon conversion on a weighted average outstanding basis exceeded basic earnings per share. The employee stock options and the warrant issued to China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd (note 11) to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares were anti-dilutive because the number of shares which could be acquired under the treasury stock method exceeded the number of shares required to be issued upon exercise of the employee stock options and the warrant.
 
On August 25, 2006, Yingli Green Energy entered into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company contract with Tianwei Baobian under which the Company granted to Tianwei Baobian a right to subscribe for newly issued ordinary shares of the Company in exchange for all but not part of Tianwei Baobian’s equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Tianwei Baobian may exercise this subscription right only after certain conditions are satisfied following the completion of the Company’s IPO. These subscription rights do not have an effect on earnings per share as these are contingent on the fulfilment of certain conditions in the future.

The Company accounts for its step-up acquisitions of the equity interests in Tianwei Yingli using the purchase method. This method requires that the acquisition cost to be allocated to the assets acquired, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on a pro-rata share of their estimated fair values. The Company makes estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on independent appraisal reports as well as its experience in valuation of similar assets and liabilities. If different judgments or assumptions were used, the amounts assigned to the individual acquired assets or liabilities could be materially different.
 
The Company did not have any goodwill prior to November 20, 2006. Goodwill in the amount of RMB 3,984,994 (US$531,843) arose during the period August 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006 resulting from the Company’s acquisition of 2.98% minority interest in Tianwei Yingli (as described below).

Technical know-how represents self-developed technologies, which were feasible at the acquisition date and include the design and configuration of the Company’s PV manufacturing line, manufacturing technologies and process for high efficiency silicon solar cells and provision of innovations for continuous improvement of cell efficiencies and manufacturing cost reduction. The Company estimated that the economic useful life of technical know-how is 6 years by taking into consideration of the remaining life cycle of the current manufacturing technologies.
 
The Company estimated the useful life of the customer relationships based primarily on the historical experience of the Company’s customer attrition rate and the Company estimates of sales to these customers in future years. A straight-line method of amortization has been adopted as the pattern in which the economic benefit of the customer relationship are used, can not be reliably determined. Order backlog represents several unfulfilled sales agreements where delivery of goods is scheduled through June 2008. The estimated fair values of short-term and long-term supply agreements were determined based on the present value of the after-tax cost savings of the Company’s long-term and short-term supply agreements. The after-tax cost savings of the Company’s long-term and short-term supply agreements were based on the difference of price of polysilicon between the agreed purchase price per the supply contracts and the forecasted spot market price at time of the forecasted inventory acquisition. The after-tax costs savings also considered the interest impact of making the pre-payments in accordance with the supply agreements payment terms. The Company estimated the useful life of the short-term and long-term supply agreements based upon the contractual delivery periods specified in each agreement. The long-term supply agreements relate to two long-term polysilicon supply agreements with delivery period commencing in 2009. The intangible asset in connection with these two agreements will be amortized over the delivery period of 5 and 9 years, commencing in 2009.

(26)  	Unaudited Pro Forma Information
 
Pro Forma Earnings Per Share
 
Upon completion of the IPO, all of the Company’s Series A and Series B redeemable convertible preferred shares and Mandatory Convertible Bonds payable to Yingli Power automatically converted into 8,081,081, 23,474,663 and 5,458,768 of ordinary shares, respectively. The calculation of unaudited pro forma earnings per share reflects the conversion of the Series A and Series B redeemable convertible preferred shares into ordinary shares on a one for one basis and the conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Bonds payable to Yingli Power as of August 7, 2007 (date of inception). The number of ordinary shares to be issued upon the conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Bonds payable to Yingli Power is equivalent to a 3.73% effective equity interest in Tianwei Yingli, which the Company has estimated based on the number of shares to be issued upon conversion based on Yingli Green Energy’s outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis and the relevant ownership percentage in Tianwei Yingli. The Company’s pro forma earnings per share calculation is as follows:

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 
(1)  	Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements consist of the financial statements of Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries (“Yingli Green Energy”). For financial reporting purposes, Baoding Tianwei Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd and its subsidiary (“Tianwei Yingli”) is considered to be the predecessor of Yingli Green Energy for periods as of and prior to September 4, 2006. Therefore, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Tianwei Yingli for the period from January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006 and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Yingli Green Energy for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) to September 30, 2006 have been presented for comparative purpose.
 
Hereinafter, the term “Company” refers to Yingli Green Energy and its predecessor, Tianwei Yingli, for all periods presented.
 
On June 13, 2007, the Company completed its IPO and was successfully listed on the New York Stock Exchange and offered 26,550,000 ADSs, representing 26,550,000 new ordinary shares, at an initial public offering price of US$11.00 per ADS.
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosures have been made in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements where events subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2006, have occurred which have a material impact on the Company. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheet of Yingli Green Energy as of December 31, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholder’s equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the period from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, 2006 and the consolidated balance sheet of Tianwei Yingli as of September 4, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income, owners’ equity, and cash flows for the period from January 1, 2006 through September 4, 2006, included elsewhere in this registration statement.
 
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the financial position as of September 30, 2007, and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods from January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006 and from August 7, 2006 (date of inception) to September 30, 2006 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, have been made.
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as with respect to the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the allocation of the purchase price for the Company’s acquisition of minority interest in Tianwei Yingli, the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangibles with definite lives, recoverability of the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, the fair value of share-based payments, allowances for doubtful receivables,

realizable value of inventories, realizability of deferred income tax assets and the fair value of financial and equity instruments and warranty obligations. Actual results could differ from estimates.
 
Management believes the Company’s business operations are subject to seasonal effects because European customers generally have less demand for PV modules in the first quarter of each calendar year. Consequently, the Company’s financial position, operating results, cash flows and trends in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of future results that may be expected for any other interim period or the full year.
 
For the convenience of readers, certain amounts as of and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB 7.4928, being the noon buy rate for U.S. dollars in effect on September 28, 2007 in the city of New York for cable transfer in RMB per U.S. dollar as certified for custom purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank. No representation is made that RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars at that rate or at any other certain rate on September 28, 2007, or at any other date.
 
(2)  	Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards
 
FASB interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48)
 
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”) which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company’s adoption of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007 did not have any effect on its financial position or results of operations.
 
SFAS No. 155
 
In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments — an amendment of FASB Statements 133 and 140”, or SFAS No. 155. SFAS No. 155 improves financial reporting by eliminating the exemption from applying SFAS No. 133 to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of the form of the instruments. SFAS No. 155 also improves financial reporting by allowing a preparer to elect fair value measurement at acquisition, at issuance, or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a re-measurement event, on an instrument by instrument basis, in cases in which a derivative would otherwise have to bifurcated, if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2007. The Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 155 did not have any effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 157
 
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurement” or SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 addresses standardizing the measurement of fair value for companies that are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes. The FASB defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to

transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measure date”. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, management does not currently believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
 
SFAS No. 159
 
In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, or SFAS No. 159. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2008, although earlier adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating whether to elect the fair value option, as permitted under SFAS No. 159.

Adjustments are recorded to write down the carrying amount of obsolete and excess inventory to its estimated net realizable value based on historical and forecasted demand. Such adjustments amounting to RMB 1,736,729, nil and RMB 11,591,581 (US$1,547,029) are recorded as cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income for the period from January 1, 2006 to September 4, 2006, August 7, 2006 (date of inception) to September 30, 2006 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, respectively.
 
(6)  	Prepayments to Suppliers
 
Polysilicon is the most important raw material used in the production of the Company’s PV products. To maintain competitive manufacturing operations, the Company depends on timely delivery by its suppliers of polysilicon in sufficient quantities. The global supply of polysilicon is controlled by a limited number of producers, and there is currently an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon. The Company is currently dependent on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial majority of polysilicon. The Company’s failure to obtain sufficient quantities of polysilicon in a timely manner could disrupt its operations, prevent deliveries of our products to our customers in the required quantities, and result in cancellations, decreased revenue and loss of market share. Some of the Company’s suppliers have a limited operating history and limited financial resources, and the contracts the Company entered into with these suppliers do not clearly provide for remedies in the event any of these suppliers is not able to, or otherwise does not, deliver, in a timely manner or at all, any materials it is contractually obligated to deliver.
 
In order to secure stable supply of polysilicon and other raw materials, the Company makes prepayments to certain suppliers. Such amounts are recorded as prepayments to suppliers, long-term prepayments to suppliers and amount due from related parties (RMB 4,857,752 and RMB 300,838,782 (US$40,150,382) as of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively) in the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to RMB 365,954,710 and RMB 1,529,651,781 (US$204,149,554) as of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively. The Company makes the prepayments without receiving collateral for such payments. As a result, the Company’s claims for such prepayments would rank only as an unsecured claim, which exposes the Company to the credit risks of the suppliers.
 
The Company also made deposits of RMB 126,823,905 and RMB 60,727,476 (US$8,104,777) as of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007, respectively, for the purchase of equipment without receiving collateral for such payments. As a result, the Company’s claims for such payments would rank only as an unsecured claim, which exposes the Company to the credit risks of the equipment suppliers. Deposits for equipment purchases are included in property, plant and equipment.

(8)  	Share-Based Compensation
 
Under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, 3,394,054 ordinary shares have been authorized for issuance of which 2,715,243 shares may be issued for the purpose of granting awards of unvested shares and up to 678,811 shares may be issued for the purpose of granting stock options. Stock options granted become exercisable over four years. The Company expects to issue new ordinary shares upon exercise of stock options. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, the Company’s board of directors and shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the number of ordinary shares that the Company is authorized to issue under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan from 3,394,054 shares to 8,240,658 shares. Among these shares, up to 2,715,243 shares may be issued for the purposes of granting awards of unvested shares and up to 5,525,415 shares may be issued for the purpose of granting stock options. The amendment did not change any other provisions of the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.
 
Restricted shares
 
On January 19, 2007, the Company’s board of directors granted 2,576,060 unvested shares for the benefit of 68 participants, consisting of 1,576,300 unvested shares granted to eight directors and officers of Yingli Green Energy and Tianwei Yingli and 999,760 unvested shares granted to 60 other employees of the Company. The unvested shares have been placed in a trust, which is controlled and managed by the Company. The shares vest with continued employment and ratably in 20% increments over a five-year period, beginning on January 19, 2008, the first anniversary following the award grant date. The unvested shares fully vest upon termination of service resulting from death or disability of the participant that is due to work-related reasons or upon a change of control. For a period of six months after any shares are vested, the Company has the option to purchase all or part of the vested shares at the then fair market value. Any vested shares that are not repurchased by the Company during the six-month period would be distributed to the participant.
 
Share-based compensation expense with respect to the unvested shares was measured based on the estimated fair value of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant of US$4.96 and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the five-year period. The estimated fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of the above grant was determined by management based on a contemporaneous valuation conducted by American Appraisal China Limited (“American Appraisal”), an independent valuation firm, as indicated in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007, and with reference to the issuance price of the Series B Preferred Shares since there was no existence of a public or active market of the Company’s ordinary shares and the Series B Preferred Shares convert to ordinary

shares on a one-to-one basis. The estimated per share fair value of US$4.96 approximated the issuance price of the Series B Preferred Shares of US$4.835 issued in December 2006 and January 2007, which was negotiated and agreed between the Company and a group of third party investors on an arm’s length basis.
 
In April 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the granting of 30,000 and 15,000 non-vested shares to one executive and one third-party consultant, respectively. Share-based compensation expense with respect to the unvested shares granted to the employee was measured based on the estimated stock issuance price of the Company’s IPO of US$11 at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the five-year period. The Company granted unvested shares to the consultant in exchange for certain services to be provided. The Company accounts for equity instrument issued to non-employee vendors in accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services” under the fair value method. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the consultant’s performance is completed. Prior to the measurement date, the equity instruments are measured at their then-current fair values at each of the reporting dates. Share-based expense recognized over the service period is adjusted to reflect changes in the fair values of the Company’s ordinary shares between the reporting periods up to the measurement date.
 
A summary of the non-vested restricted share activity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 is as follows:

The Company has accounted for these options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”, (“SFAS No. 123R”) by recognizing compensation cost based on the grant-date fair value over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.

The weighted-average option fair value of US$9.76 (RMB 73.13) per share or an aggregate of RMB 20,169,142 (US$2,691,803) on the date of grant was determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	For the Nine-Month
 	 	Period Ended
 	 	September 30,
 	 	2007
 
Expected volatility
 	 	63%	 
Expected dividends yield
 	 	0%	 
Expected term
 	 	6.18 years	 
Risk-free interest rate (per annum)
 	 	5.2%	 
Estimated fair value of underlying ordinary shares (per share)
 	US$	15.17	 
 
The weighted-average expected volatility of 63% was based on the average volatility of several listed comparable companies in the solar product manufacturing industry. Since the Company did not have a sufficient trading history at the time the options were issued, the Company estimated the potential volatility of its ordinary share price by referring to the latest six year’s average volatility of these comparable companies because management believes that the average volatility of such companies was a reasonable benchmark to use in estimating the expected volatility of the Company’s ordinary shares.
 
No options were granted during the comparable periods in 2006.

(9)  	Ordinary and Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares
 
On December 13, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement to issue 24,405,377 Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares (“Series B Preferred Shares”) to Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, an affiliate of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, and 13 other investors for an aggregate purchase price of US$118,000,000 or US$4.835 per Series B Preferred Share. As of December 31, 2006, the Company issued 23,474,663 Series B Preferred Shares for an aggregate purchase price of US$113,500,000 (RMB 887,547,300).
 
In January 2007, the Company issued an additional 930,714 Series B Preferred Shares to two investors for an aggregate purchase price of US$4,500,000 (RMB 34,803,900). In connection with the issuance of Series B Preferred Shares in January 2007, the Company issued warrants to purchase 105,603 of ordinary shares (“the Series B Warrants”) to the investors. The Series B Warrant is not transferable and is subject to certain cancellation and return features. Upon the conversion of the Shareholder Loan, any unexercised Series B Warrants will be automatically cancelled and the Series B preferred shareholders are obligated to return any shares issued under the exercise of the warrants. If the Series B preferred shareholders have sold their ordinary shares issued under the exercise of the warrants, then the Series B preferred shareholders will pay the Company an amount to be mutually determined between the Company and such Series B preferred shareholders.
 
The Series B Warrant and Series B Preferred Shares were recorded at their relative fair values of US$44,353 (RMB 343,035) and US$4,455,647 (RMB 34,460,865), respectively, in aggregate or US$0.42 (RMB 3.25) and US$4.79 (RMB 37.05), respectively, on a per share basis.
 
The estimated fair value of the Series B Preferred Shares was determined by management based on a contemporaneous valuation performed by American Appraisal, as indicated in its valuation report, dated March 30, 2007, supplemented by the forecasted profitability and cash flows of the Company’s business. The fair value of the Series B Warrant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility rate of 47%, risk-free interest rate of 5.05% and expected term of 0.3 years. The resulting amount was then discounted by 90% to take into account management’s estimation and probability of the warrants not being exercised since the warrants are automatically cancelled upon the conversion of the Shareholder Loan into Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital. The relative fair value of the Series B Warrant was recorded as a discount to the issuance price of the Series B Preferred Share and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. The Company has determined that there was no embedded beneficial conversion feature attributable to the Series B Preferred Shares that were issued with warrants at the commitment date, since US$4.79, the effective conversion price of the Series B Preferred Shares, was greater than US$4.74, the fair value of the Company’s ordinary shares. The estimated fair value of the underlying ordinary shares at the commitment date was determined by management based on a contemporaneous valuation performed by American Appraisal, as indicated in its valuation report dated March 30, 2007, supplemented by the forecasted profitability and cash flows of the Company’s business.
 
In March 2007, the Company issued additional warrants to purchase 688,090 of the Company’s ordinary shares at a per share price of US$0.01 (“the Additional Series B Warrants”) to Series B preferred shareholders (other than the three investors who had made advance payments) as consideration for terminating the escrow arrangement with respect to the proceeds received from the issuance and sale of the Series B Preferred Shares. The termination of the escrow arrangement removed the restriction placed on proceeds of US$19.6 million that were received from the issuance

and sale of Series B Preferred Shares in December 2006 and January 2007. The terms of the Additional Series B Warrants are identical to the terms of the warrants that were previously issued in connection with the issuances of the Series B Preferred Shares described above.
 
As the issuance of the Additional Series B Warrants was related and tied to the Series B Shares issuances and not issued in a separate stand-alone transaction, the estimated fair value of the warrants of US$756,213 (RMB 5,848,702) was recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of Series B Preferred Share with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. The estimated fair value of the Additional Series B Warrant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility rate of 56%, risk-free interest rate of 5.06% and expected term of 0.16 years. The resulting amount was then discounted by 90% to take into account management’s estimation and probability of the warrants not being exercised since the warrants are automatically cancelled upon the conversion of the Shareholder Loan into Tianwei Yingli’s registered capital.
 
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, the accretion of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares (“Series A Preferred Shares”) and Series B Preferred Shares to their redemption value was RMB 53,150,976 (US$7,093,607).
 
On May 23, 2007, the Series A Preferred Shares Warrant was exercised at the exercise price of US$2.10 per ordinary share and the Company issued 678,811 ordinary shares and received aggregate proceeds of US$1,425,503.
 
On June 13, 2007, upon completion of the IPO, 8,081,081 Series A Preferred Shares and 24,405,377 Series B Preferred Shares were converted into 32,486,458 ordinary shares.
 
On June 13, 2007, the Company issued 26,550,000 new ordinary shares at US$11 per share upon closing of an IPO with net cash proceeds of RMB 2,011,406,175.
 
As of September 30, 2007, there were 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares authorised and 126,923,609 ordinary shares issued and outstanding.
 
(10)  	Mandatory Convertible Bonds
 
In conjunction with the IPO, on June 21, 2007 and June 22, 2007, respectively, the Company paid RMB 269,015,825 (US$35,903,244) to Yingli Power for redemption of the Mandatory Redeemable Bonds and delivered 5,340,088 ordinary shares to Yingli Power for conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Bonds. The Company has also determined that the non-detachable convertible feature had no intrinsic value on the settlement date based on the conversion price when the number of shares to be issued was known and the conversion contingency was resolved. Therefore, no beneficial conversion feature was recognized upon settlement.

Net income, after deducting accretion to holders of preferred shareholders, has been allocated to the ordinary shares and preferred shares based on their respective rights to share in dividends.
 
The computation of diluted income per share for the period from August 7, 2006 to September 30, 2006, did not assume conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares because, when applying the if-converted method, the effect of the ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Shares, including the maximum number of 8,081,081 shares issuable under the conversion terms of the Series A Preferred Shares agreement was anti-dilutive. The conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares was anti-dilutive because the amount of the accretion to the Series A Preferred Shares redemption value for the period per ordinary shares obtainable upon conversion on a weighted average outstanding basis exceeded basic earnings per share.
 
The computation of diluted income per share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, did not assume conversion of the Series A and B Preferred Shares prior to the actual conversion upon completion of the IPO because, when applying the if-converted method, the effect of the ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of Series A and B Preferred Shares, including the maximum number of 32,486,458 shares issuable under the conversion terms of the Series A and B

Preferred Shares agreements, was anti-dilutive. The conversion of the Series A and B Preferred Shares was anti-dilutive because the amount of the accretion to the Series A and B Preferred Shares redemption value for the period per ordinary shares obtainable upon conversion on a weighted average outstanding basis exceeded basic earnings per share.
 
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, potential dilutive securities also consisted of 5,340,088 ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of Mandatory Convertible Bonds payable to Yingli Power prior to the actual conversion upon completion of the IPO and 2,068,252 ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase the Company’s shares prior to the actual exercise on May 23, 2007. The conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Bonds payable to Yingli Power was anti-dilutive because the amount of interest expense attributable to the Mandatory Convertible Bonds payable to Yingli Power for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 per ordinary share obtainable upon conversion on an weighted average outstanding basis exceeded basic earnings per share. The warrant to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares were anti-dilutive because the number of shares which could be acquired under the treasury stock method exceeded the number of shares required to be issued upon the exercise of the warrant.
 
Tianwei Yingli is not a share-based company and had no outstanding shares for the periods presented, and therefore, no earnings per share data for Tianwei Yingli has been presented.

The Company’s PV modules are typically sold with a two-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a 10-year and 25-year warranty against declines of more than 10.0% and 20.0% of initial power generation capacity, respectively. As a result, the Company bears the risk of warranty claims long after the Company has sold its products and recognized revenues. The Company has sold PV modules only since 2003, and none of the Company’s PV modules has been in use for more than five years. In connection with the Company’s PV system sales in the PRC, the Company provides a one- to five-year warranty against defects in the Company’s modules, storage batteries, controllers and inverters. The Company performs industry-standard testing to test the quality, durability and safety of the Company’s products. As a result of such tests, management believes the quality, durability and safety of its products are within industry norms. Management’s estimate of the amount of its warranty obligation is based on the results of these tests and consideration given to the warranty accrual practice of other companies in the same business. Consequently, the Company accrues the equivalent of 1% of net revenues as a warranty liability to accrue the estimated cost of its warranty obligations.
 
Actual warranty costs are charged against the accrued warranty liability. To the extent that actual warranty costs differ significantly from estimates, the Company will revise its warranty provisions accordingly.

scheduled through June 2008. The estimated fair value of long-term supply agreements were determined based on the present value of the after-tax cost savings of the Company’s long-term supply agreements. The after-tax cost savings of the Company’s long-term supply agreements were based on the difference of price of polysilicon between the agreed purchase price per the supply contracts and the forecasted spot market price at time of the forecasted inventory acquisition. The after-tax costs savings also considered the interest impact of making the prepayments in accordance with the supply agreements payment terms. The Company estimated the useful life of the long-term supply agreements based upon the contractual delivery periods specified in each agreement. The long-term supply agreements related to two long-term polysilicon supply agreements with delivery periods both commencing in 2009. The intangible asset in connection with these two agreements will amortized over the delivery period of five and nine years, commencing in 2009.
 
The aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets for nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 was RMB 30,892,575 (US$4,122,968). Amortization expense related to (i) customer relationship and order backlog of RMB 11,523,174 (US$1,537,900) is recorded in selling expenses, (ii) technical know-how of RMB 15,782,919 (US$2,106,411) is recorded in general and administrative expense, and iii) supplier agreements of RMB 3,586,482 (US$478,657) is recorded in cost of revenues. As of September 30, 2007, the estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows:

(19)  	Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, amounts due from related parties, accounts payable, borrowings from related parties, short-term borrowings, advances from customers, and other amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. There is no quoted market price for the Company’s investment in its affiliate. Accordingly, a reasonable estimate of fair value could not be made without incurring excessive costs.
 
(20)  	Subsequent events
 
 	a)	 Shareholder’s Rights Plan
 
On October 17, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors has adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (the “Rights Plan”). Under the Rights Plan, one right (a “Right”) was distributed with respect to each ordinary share of the Company outstanding at the close of business on October 26, 2007.
 
The Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group obtains ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s ordinary shares (including by acquisition of the American depositary shares representing an ownership interest in the ordinary shares (the “ADSs”)) or enters into an acquisition transaction without the approval of the Board of Directors, at which time the holders of the Rights (other than the acquiring person or group) will be entitled to purchase from the Company ordinary shares of the Company at half of the market price at the time of purchase. In the event of a subsequent acquisition of the Company, the holders (other than the acquiring person or group) may be entitled to buy ordinary shares of the acquiring entity at half price. The exercise price is US$95.00 per Right.
 
Under the Rights Plan, Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co., Ltd. will be permitted to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares (i) pursuant to its subscription rights under the Joint Venture Contract dated August 25, 2006 with the Company, as amended, and (ii) from Yingli Power Holding Company Ltd., in each case without triggering the exercisability of the Rights.
 
The Rights Plan will continue in effect until October 17, 2017, unless earlier redeemed or terminated by the Company, as provided in the Rights Plan.
 
b) Securities Offering

INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS
 
ITEM 6.  	INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.
 
Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated articles of association, which will become effective upon the closing of this offering, will provide for indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own dishonesty, fraud or default.
 
The form of underwriting agreements to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 and Exhibit 1.2 to this registration statement will also provide for indemnification of us and our officers and directors.
 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
 
ITEM 7.  	RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.
 
During the past three years, we have issued the following securities (including options to acquire our ordinary shares). We believe that each of the following issuances was exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act or under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act regarding transactions not involving a public offering.

Notes:
 
(1)		US$211,341 of the consideration paid for the Series A preferred shares has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to the warrant issued to TB Management Ltd., an affiliate of Inspiration Partners Limited. See “Restructuring — Private Equity Investments and Other Financings Following the Restructuring” in the prospectus which forms part of this registration statement. TB Management Ltd. has since transferred the warrant to Fairdeal Development Ltd., an affiliate of Inspiration Partners Limited, which exercised the warrant on May 23, 2007.
 
(2)		US$887,064 of the consideration paid for the Series B preferred shares has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to the warrant issued to Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd and ten other Series B investors. See “Restructuring — Private Equity Investments and Other Financings Following the Restructuring” in the prospectus which forms part of this registration statement.
 
(3)		The warrants were issued in consideration of the early termination of an escrow arrangement which removed the restriction on the proceeds of US$19.6 million that were received from the issuance and sale of the Series B preferred shares that took place from December 20, 2006 through January 13, 2007.
 
(4)		The warrant was issued to China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd. pursuant to the repayment agreement, dated December 29, 2006, among us, Tianwei Yingli, China Foreign Economic and Trade Trust & Investment Co., Ltd. and China Sunshine Investment Co., Ltd. We recorded US$599,000 representing the fair value of the warrant as part of the cost to extinguish the convertible loan. See “Restructuring — Private Equity Investments and Other Financings Following the Restructuring” in the prospectus which forms part of this registration statement.

See Exhibit Index beginning on page II-6 of this registration statement.
 
ITEM 9.  	UNDERTAKINGS.
 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant under the provisions described in Item 6, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
