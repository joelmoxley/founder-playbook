PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus and does not contain all of the information that you should consider in making your investment decision. Before investing in our common stock, you should carefully read this entire prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus and the information set forth under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “BrightSource,” “we,” the “Company,” “us” and “our” refer to BrightSource Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Overview
BrightSource is a leading solar thermal technology company that designs, develops and sells proprietary systems that produce reliable, clean energy in utility-scale electric power plants. Our systems use proprietary solar power tower technology to deliver cost-competitive renewable electricity with characteristics highly valued by utilities, such as reliability and consistency. Our systems are also used by industrial companies to create high-temperature steam for use in applications such as thermal enhanced oil recovery, or EOR.
Our systems use fields of tracking mirrors, known as heliostats, controlled by our proprietary software to concentrate sunlight onto a solar receiver/boiler unit to produce high-temperature steam. Once produced, the steam is used either in a conventional steam turbine to produce electricity or in industrial process applications such as thermal EOR. By integrating conventional power block components, such as turbines, with our proprietary technology and state-of-the-art solar field design, electric power plants using our systems can deliver cost-competitive, reliable and clean power when needed most. In addition, by incorporating thermal energy storage and/or integrating our technology with natural gas or other fossil fuels through a process referred to as hybridization, electric power plants using our systems can further increase output and reliability.
In implementing systems using our proprietary technology, we partner with several parties to develop utility-scale solar electric power plants. These parties include engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, contractors; boiler suppliers; turbine suppliers; and financing parties that may consist of strategic and/or financial investors. For instance, at Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, or Ivanpah, a 377 megawatt, or MW, project that commenced construction in October 2010, Bechtel is the EPC contractor, Riley Power is the boiler supplier, Siemens is the turbine supplier, and NRG Solar (a subsidiary of NRG Energy) and Google are together the controlling equity investors.
While we primarily sell systems using our proprietary technology, we also act as the system architect for the layout and optimization of the solar field. In addition, we provide technical services related to the design, engineering and operation of our systems and may provide overall project development services. During the construction phase of a project, we receive revenue from the sale of our proprietary technology. For the projects where we lead development, we expect to own initially 100% of the equity in the projects, but may seek development partners on specific projects. We intend to ultimately transfer the majority of the equity in these projects to third parties while retaining a minority equity interest, as we did with Ivanpah.
We have produced high-temperature steam using our technology since 2008, when we commenced operations at our 6 megawatt thermal, or MWth, demonstration solar-to-steam facility, the Solar Energy Development Center, in Israel. We believe this facility has consistently produced the highest temperature and pressure steam of any solar thermal facility in the world, capable of driving highly efficient, cost-effective turbines. This facility validated our technology and continues to provide important operational and production data.

Through our project companies, we have 13 executed and outstanding long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, to deliver approximately 2.4 gigawatts, or GW, of installed capacity to two of the largest electric utilities in the United States, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, or PG&E, and Southern California Edison, or SCE. We believe these PPAs represent one of the largest utility-scale solar pipelines in the United States and should provide us with a significant revenue opportunity between 2012 and 2016. For purposes of illustration, our agreements for the supply of equipment and services to the Ivanpah project, which has three PPAs totaling 377 MW, represent $672.0 million of contracted sales, which equates to approximately $1.8 million of contracted sales per MW. Consistent with our 14% ownership in Ivanpah, we recognize 86% of any actual sales as revenue.
As the first step in fulfilling our obligations under the PPAs, in 2007 we commenced the permitting and financing of Ivanpah, a project comprised of three concentrating solar thermal power plants on an approximately 3,500 acre site in California’s Mojave Desert. After receiving our permits, we initiated construction of Ivanpah in October 2010. In April 2011, Ivanpah was partially financed with a $1.6 billion loan guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Energy, or the DOE. Consistent with our business development strategy in the United States, we also transferred a controlling interest in the equity of Ivanpah to a consortium of investors led by NRG Solar. As of February 2012, the three power plants at lvanpah were 26.5%, 18.3% and 15.7% complete, respectively, and overall EPC at Ivanpah was 25.2% complete. When commissioned, Ivanpah will have an installed capacity of 377 MW and will increase the amount of solar thermal generation capacity currently installed in the United States by over 75%.
We have a development site portfolio of approximately 90,000 acres under our control in California and the U.S. Southwest that has the potential to accommodate approximately 9 GW (gross) of installed capacity. We currently have three sites in advanced development, Rio Mesa Solar and Hidden Hills Ranch, each located in California, and Sandy Valley, located in Nevada. Rio Mesa Solar consists of approximately 5,800 acres, Hidden Hills Ranch consists of approximately 3,300 acres, and Sandy Valley consists of approximately 10,000 acres. In August 2011, we filed an Application for Certification with the California Energy Commission for the development of two 250 MW solar power plants at Hidden Hills Ranch. In October 2011, we filed an Application for Certification with the California Energy Commission for the development of three 250 MW solar power plants at Rio Mesa Solar. Although Sandy Valley will not require an Application for Certification because it is located in Nevada, similar permitting activity will begin in 2012.
In 2007, we entered the thermal EOR business after Chevron selected our technology through a competitive process. After winning the business, we signed a contract with Chevron in 2008 to provide a 29 MWth EOR facility in Coalinga, California. We commenced construction of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project in 2009, and the project began operations in October 2011.
In addition to our relationship with Chevron, we have strategic relationships with global, industry-leading companies, including Alstom, Bechtel and NRG Solar. In order to accelerate the adoption of our systems globally, we are leveraging these relationships and our world-class partners’ local expertise in domestic and international markets to pursue expansion opportunities more rapidly and cost-effectively than might otherwise be possible. Particularly for our international markets, we intend to enter into additional strategic relationships with other leading companies that are active in the regions where we are pursuing project opportunities.
Our Opportunities
For Utility Applications
According to a report released in 2011 by the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, global demand for electric power is expected to increase 84% from 2008 to 2035, reaching 35.2 trillion

kilowatt hours. Although fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas generated approximately 68% of the world’s electricity in 2008, demand for alternative sources of electricity has grown significantly and is expected to continue to increase as a result of regulatory policies and incentives put in place to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve energy security. These policies and incentives are intended to stimulate deployment of renewable technologies and require utilities and grid operators to procure an increasing proportion of their energy supply from renewable sources. For instance, California has recently adopted legislation requiring all California retail energy sellers, including municipal power agencies, to derive 33% of the energy they supply from renewable energy sources by 2020. In addition, recent global events have called into question future energy production from nuclear facilities, which the EIA in 2011 estimated will represent 13.9% of the global electricity generation in 2035. To the extent that production is cancelled or delayed, renewable energy sources will likely be called upon to help bridge the gap.
The production characteristics of some renewable energy sources present a number of integration challenges for utilities and grid operators. To ensure reliable and consistent electricity supply, utilities and grid operators (operators of electric transmission and distribution infrastructure) require the following:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Sufficient generation capacity available to meet peak demand:    Peak demand represents the highest point of electricity consumption during any given period. Failure to meet peak demand even for short periods of time can, at its worst, result in rolling blackouts and power outages.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Sufficient flexible power production:    As electric demand or supply changes over the course of the day, grid operators must ensure that there are flexible generation resources, such as dispatchable fossil fuel plants, that can vary their production on demand.

The amount of power from renewable sources, especially wind and photovoltaic, or PV, has grown significantly in recent years. Although wind and PV power plants may provide clean energy with low variable costs compared to fossil fuel alternatives, their production characteristics, such as intermittency and lower peak availability, present a number of integration and reliability challenges for utilities and grid operators. These production characteristics add system integration costs. These system integration costs, combined with generation and transmission expenses as well as energy and capacity benefits, comprise the net system cost to the utility. Net system costs have been rising as more energy is produced and procured from wind and PV and, as a result, utilities, grid operators and regulators are placing increasing importance on net system costs when evaluating new renewable energy capacity.
For Thermal EOR and Other Industrial Applications
Our systems can also be used for the production of steam for industrial process applications such as thermal EOR. Our technology enables steam flooding for thermal EOR, which is a proven, effective method of increasing production from heavy oil reserves. EOR is important to the future of oil production because conventional oil recovery methods are only able to extract about 10% to 30% of the original oil from a reservoir. With much of the easy-to-produce oil already recovered from developed oilfields, producers have attempted several techniques that offer prospects for ultimately recovering 30% to 60%, or more, of the reservoir’s original oil in-place. These techniques are generally referred to as EOR. According to BCC Research, the global market for EOR technologies was $4.7 billion in 2009 and is expected to grow at a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 28% to $16.3 billion in 2014.

In addition to thermal EOR, the market to provide steam to customers, particularly those with significant steam requirements and/or remote operations, includes off-grid electrical generation and other industrial applications such as mining and desalination.
Our Technology Solution
For Utility Applications
Our proprietary solar thermal technology is engineered to produce predictable, reliable and clean energy at a competitive cost. Our solution is specifically designed to address the challenges of utility-scale renewable power generation. Electric power plants using our systems provide:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Sufficient generation capacity at peak demand:    Our power production profile, or the amount of power electric power plants using our systems produce at different times of the day, can be tailored to the demand profile that most utilities serve. This significantly enhances the average revenue per megawatt hour, or MWh, that our system is able to generate compared to other renewable sources which typically produce power well below their capacity during peak demand periods.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
More reliable and consistent power output:    Electric power plants using our systems produce more predictable power output than that of highly intermittent renewable sources such as wind and PV. Because our technology converts solar energy into steam, rather than directly into electricity, the system temperature remains high enough to continue to generate electricity through short periods of intermittent cloud cover. Therefore, electric power plants using our systems are less likely to experience sudden and unexpected power output fluctuations.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Increased production capability through thermal energy storage and hybridization:    In contrast to wind and PV, our technology allows the incorporation of existing cost-effective thermal energy storage and hybridization. These features can extend the hours of our production, reduce system integration costs and increase the reliability and consistency of our systems. Specifically, thermal energy storage reduces the cost of electricity by increasing a plant’s capacity factor, and, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL, allows electricity generation to be shifted to critical hours with higher energy prices and enables more thermal energy to be utilized from the solar field. As utilities purchase greater amounts of electricity from renewable energy sources, we believe energy storage and hybridization with other sources such as natural gas will make electric power plants using our systems increasingly valuable to utilities and grid operators.

As a result of the characteristics discussed above, electric power plants using our systems deliver electricity with attributes highly valued by utilities, such as reliability and flexibility, at a competitive net system cost. Electric power plants using our systems have higher reliability value and lower integration costs than intermittent renewable technologies such as wind and PV. In addition, by providing energy during peak demand when utilities are willing to pay the highest price, electric power plants using our systems are able to maximize the revenue realized from the sale of electricity. Moreover, as the power grid is loaded with increasing quantities of renewable resources such as wind and PV, we believe that we will have a competitive advantage over other renewable technologies that have higher total system costs and do not produce electricity as reliably during periods of peak demand.

For Thermal EOR and Other Industrial Applications
Our solar-to-steam solution for thermal EOR, off-grid electricity and other industrial applications is designed to offer oil production and other industrial companies a cost-effective, emission-free alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based steam generation. Our high-temperature steam is easily integrated into steam produced from other sources, allowing efficient use of existing infrastructure and integration into operations.
Our Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths position us as a leader within the utility-scale renewable energy market:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Superior technology:    Our system can deliver clean, reliable power that naturally extends late in the day, and can be complemented with thermal energy storage and hybridization to address peak electricity demands at a competitive cost. The foundation of our technology is our solar field optimization software and proprietary control system that together optimize the output of energy from our system to match the needs of utilities and maximize project revenue.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Substantial revenue visibility with fully committed, long-term agreements:    Through our project companies, we have 13 executed and outstanding PPAs with two of the largest electric utilities in the United States, PG&E and SCE, to deliver approximately 2.4 GW of installed capacity. Three of the PPAs are associated with Ivanpah, and we have transferred a controlling interest to a third party. We retain 10 PPAs to deliver approximately 2.0 GW of installed capacity. To the extent we can finance and successfully build the capacity to deliver on those contracts, we believe these PPAs should provide us with a significant revenue opportunity through sales of our systems to the project companies or EPC contractors. Our agreements for the supply of equipment and services to the Ivanpah project, which has three PPAs totaling 377 MW, represent $672.0 million of contracted sales, which equates to approximately $1.8 million of contracted sales per MW. Consistent with our 14% ownership in Ivanpah, we recognize 86% of any actual sales as revenue.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Experienced management team:    Our team has extensive solar thermal technical and project development expertise and has collectively developed, constructed and managed more than 25 GW of solar, wind and conventional power projects worldwide. The principal members of our technical team designed and developed solar thermal power plants representing approximately 70% of the solar thermal generation capacity currently installed in the United States.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Demonstrated alternative applications of our solar thermal technology:    We use our technology to provide oil production and other industrial companies with a cost-effective, emission-free alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based steam generation methods for thermal EOR, off-grid electricity and other industrial applications. Our offering is particularly attractive in remote areas with limited infrastructure or high fuel costs. EOR and other industrial process applications of our technology diversify our revenue streams and contribute to our future growth globally.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Strong global partners support our expansion:    We believe our partnerships with leading, global companies such as Alstom, Chevron, NRG Solar and Bechtel provide a strong competitive advantage. By leveraging these relationships and our world-class partners’ local expertise in domestic and international markets, we believe we can enter new markets and pursue expansion opportunities more rapidly and cost-effectively than might otherwise be possible.

Table of Contents

 	Ÿ	 	
High-quality development site portfolio:    To accelerate the development of our technology and satisfy our signed PPAs, we are developing projects in the United States. We have a development site portfolio of approximately 90,000 acres under our control in California and the U.S. Southwest that is well suited for solar power generation. This portfolio has the potential to accommodate approximately 9 GW (gross) of installed capacity.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Low impact design:    Our systems are designed to have a low impact on the site, limiting changes to topography, soil conditions and vegetation. They also cost-effectively use air instead of water to cool steam, which reduces water usage by more than 90% over competing solar thermal technologies that use conventional wet-cooling systems.

Our Growth Strategies
We intend to pursue the following growth strategies to maintain and expand our position as a leader within the utility-scale renewable energy market:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Leverage our PPAs into sales of systems using our technology:    We intend to use our high-quality development site portfolio to create attractive opportunities for projects where we can sell our solar thermal technology. To the extent we can finance and successfully build the capacity to deliver on those contracts, we expect to generate substantial revenue, cash flow and profit growth, providing us with the ability to scale and the resources needed to pursue broader growth opportunities.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Focus on identifying and creating additional opportunities to sell our systems:    We focus our business development efforts on identifying new projects and additional PPAs in domestic markets and work with strategic partners in international target markets that are characterized by high levels of direct sunlight and energy demand. In addition, we expect to leverage the performance of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project to establish additional relationships for thermal EOR and other solar-to-steam applications.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Develop additional relationships with global industry leaders:    We intend to create new relationships with global industry leaders to expand our business. We intend to leverage these new and existing relationships to enter additional markets and pursue expansion opportunities more rapidly and cost-effectively. For example, in February 2012, we entered into an agreement with Sasol, a leading global energy and chemicals company, to conduct a comprehensive front-end engineering and design study for a potential project utilizing our technology in South Africa.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Continue to improve our proprietary solar thermal technology:    While our systems are currently cost-competitive, we expect our technology roadmap to yield significant cost reductions and a lower net system cost to utilities. We intend to continue to lead innovation in solar thermal technology and drive greater capital and operating efficiencies with each new generation of solar power tower technology.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Enhance operating characteristics utilities value most:    We recently introduced solar thermal energy storage capabilities and intend to pursue additional system enhancements such as hybridization where appropriate. We expect these enhancements to yield a lower net system cost to utilities through greater on-peak availability, higher reliability and increased output.

Risks We Face
There are a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial and operating performance and growth prospects. You should carefully consider all of the risks discussed in “Risk Factors,” which begin on page 14, the other information contained in this prospectus and our

consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock. These risks include, among others:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
We have generated substantial net losses and negative operating cash flows since our inception and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future as part of the development and construction of solar thermal energy projects using our systems;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Our proprietary technology has a limited history and may perform below expectations when implemented on utility-scale projects;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Our future growth is dependent upon the successful implementation of Ivanpah, the first utility-scale solar thermal power project using our technology, as well as the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
We may be required to fund cost overruns over the funded reserves for the completion of Ivanpah;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
We may not be able to finance the growth of our business, which we expect will require significant amounts of capital, including the development and construction of solar thermal energy projects using our systems;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
We depend heavily on federal, state and local government support for renewable energy sources, which is subject to change;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Our industry is rapidly evolving and highly competitive and failure to further refine and develop improved technologies could render our solar thermal technology obsolete and reduce our sales and market share relative to other renewable energy sources;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Our ability to execute on our existing and future pipeline of PPAs and solar-to-steam contracts, as well as our ability to sell our systems, depends in large part on locating suitable sites, securing site control and sufficient transmission capacity, and obtaining necessary governmental approvals and permits, the failure of which would adversely affect our business;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Current or future litigation or administrative proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Problems with system component quality or performance at Ivanpah may cause us to incur solar field and receiver system warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue to decline.

The Offering
 
Common stock offered by us

 	6,900,000 shares (or 7,935,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full).
Common stock sold by us in the concurrent private placements

 	

ALSTOM Power Inc., or Alstom, and Caithness Development, LLC and/or its affiliates, or Caithness, will purchase from us in a private placement the number of shares of our common stock equal to $65.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, this would be 2,954,545 and 454,545 shares, respectively. We will receive the full proceeds and will not pay any underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to the shares that are sold in the private placements. The Alstom private placement is expected to close the later of (i) immediately subsequent to the closing of this offering or (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The Caithness private placement is expected to close immediately subsequent to the closing of this offering. The sale of these shares to Alstom and Caithness will not be registered in this offering and will be subject to a lock-up of 180 days. We refer to the private placements of these shares of common stock as the concurrent private placements.
Shares outstanding after this offering and the concurrent private placements

 	
45,448,425 shares.

Use of proceeds

 	We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements of approximately $210.1 million ($231.3 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full) based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, which may include domestic and international development activities, hiring additional personnel and investing in research and development.

BRSE

The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after this offering and the concurrent private placements is based on (i) 35,139,335 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2011, after giving effect to the conversion of our outstanding Series A, B, C, D and E convertible preferred stock into 30,069,900 shares of common stock immediately prior to the completion of this offering (which includes the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series E preferred stock, as described below, at an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) and (ii) 3,409,090 shares of common stock to be purchased from us in the concurrent private placements. The number of shares of our common stock actually issued upon the conversion of our outstanding shares of Series E preferred stock, which will occur immediately prior to the completion of this offering, depends in part on the actual initial public offering price of our common stock in this offering. The terms of our Series E preferred stock provide that the ratio at which each share of Series E preferred stock automatically converts into shares of our common stock in connection with a qualified IPO (for which this offering will qualify) will increase if the initial public offering price per share of common stock in the qualified IPO is below a specified minimum dollar amount, which would result in additional shares of common stock being issued upon conversion of the Series E preferred stock. In the event the actual initial public offering price is lower than $32.49 per share, the shares of Series E preferred stock will convert into a larger number of shares of common stock; if the initial public offering price is equal to the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, the Series E preferred stock would convert into 11,368,759 shares of common stock. A $1.00 decrease in the initial public offering price would increase by 541,370, and a $1.00 increase in the initial public offering price would decrease by 494,294, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E preferred stock. The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after this offering and the concurrent private placements excludes:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
3,670,474 shares issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding as of December 31, 2011 at a weighted average exercise price of $11.34 per share under our 2006 Stock Plan;

(2)	Our basic net loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock (excluding common stock subject to repurchase) and, if dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of stock options to purchase shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock (using the treasury stock method) and the conversion of our convertible preferred stock (using the if-converted method). For purposes of these calculations, potential shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of common stock as their effect is antidilutive since we generated a net loss in each period.
(3)	The basic and diluted net loss per share computation excludes potential shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock and exercise of options and warrants to purchase common stock as their effect would be antidilutive. See note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed explanation of the determination of the shares used in computing basic and diluted loss per share.
(4)	Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock has been computed to give effect to the conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common stock.

RISK FACTORS
This offering involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this prospectus before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.
This prospectus also contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements refer to our future plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. These statements may be identified by the use of words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans” and similar expressions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements. Factors that could contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus.
Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry
We have generated substantial net losses and negative operating cash flows since our inception and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future as part of the development and construction of solar thermal energy projects using our systems.
We have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since we commenced operations. We have incurred losses of approximately $288.2 million from our inception through December 31, 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, we incurred net losses of $71.6 million and $111.0 million, respectively, and our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(64.1) million and $83.9 million, respectively.
We expect that our net losses and our negative operating cash flows will continue for the foreseeable future, as we increase our development activities and construct solar thermal energy projects. Solar thermal energy projects typically accumulate negative cash flow during development prior to commercial operation, at which point the projects generally are expected to begin to generate positive operating cash flow. Currently, our project development generally begins approximately three to seven years before commercial operation. We also expect to incur the incremental costs of operating as a public company, contributing to our losses and operating uses of cash. Our costs may also increase due to such factors as higher than anticipated financing and other costs, non-performance by third-party suppliers or subcontractors, increases in the costs of labor or materials, and major incidents or catastrophic events. If any of these or similar factors occur, our net losses and accumulated deficit could increase significantly and the value of our common stock could decline.
Our proprietary technology has a limited history and may perform below expectations when implemented on utility-scale projects.
We use proprietary technology that has not been previously implemented on utility-scale projects of the size and complexity of the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, or Ivanpah, and Ivanpah may experience technological problems that neither we nor any of the third-party independent engineers that have reviewed our projects are able to foresee. The systems that we will implement on utility-scale projects include a solar field with heliostats controlled by advanced software systems that concentrate sunlight onto a receiver to produce high-temperature steam. If the implementation of our proprietary technology is unsuccessful, it could negatively impact the successful operation of projects using our systems and may result in additional payments, deductions or defaults under key project documents, including our PPAs or other financing arrangements.
Furthermore, given the size and complexity of Ivanpah and other utility-scale projects’ solar field construction and the fact that third-party contractors will be assembling systems using new and
 
14
Table of Contents

unproven processes, there may be potential construction delays and unforeseen cost overruns. Delays at any single phase of construction may significantly impact the overall timing of commencing operations at Ivanpah or other projects.
In addition, there is a lack of long-term reliability data for our proprietary systems and technology. Actual long-term performance of these parts, including heliostats in the field, may fall short of expectations. Heliostats may be susceptible to damage from weather-related or other unforeseen events. For example, a severe windstorm in late November 2011 at the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project resulted in movement in some of the pylons on which the heliostats are mounted. We are completing modifications to prevent any future pylon movement at Coalinga and are deploying redesigned pylons in much of the Ivanpah project and modifying some plant operating guidelines to reduce the risk of a similar occurrence in the future and enable the heliostats to operate at higher wind loads. However, we cannot be certain that these modifications or revised guidelines will prevent similar occurrences in the future. Furthermore, our SolarPLUS solar thermal power plant solution, which combines our solar power tower technology with two-tank molten-salt storage capabilities, may not perform as expected. Equipment performance issues at our projects could result in significant operational problems for our company, including increased maintenance costs, decreased revenue, inability to meet energy delivery requirements or defaults under project or financing documents.
Our future growth is dependent upon the successful implementation of Ivanpah, the first utility-scale solar thermal power project using our technology, as well as the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project.
Our future success depends on the ability to construct Ivanpah, the first utility-scale solar thermal power project using our technology, in a cost-effective and timely manner. The ability to complete Ivanpah and the planning, development and construction of all three phases are subject to significant risk and uncertainty, including:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Ivanpah is being primarily financed by a U.S. Department of Energy, or DOE, guaranteed loan facility, which requires the project companies to remain in compliance with numerous financial, construction and operational covenants to draw funds under the loan facility, compliance with which are within the control of NRG Solar, the majority equity owner and operator of Ivanpah;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
the construction of any of our projects will be subject to the risks inherent in the construction of solar thermal projects that have never been built on the scale of Ivanpah, including risks of delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which may be out of our control, such as delays in government approvals, burdensome permit conditions and delays in the delivery of materials and equipment that we manufacture or obtain from suppliers;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
our customized system and equipment may take longer and cost more to engineer and build than expected and may never operate as required to meet our production plans, which production plans are guaranteed pursuant to our construction and supply contracts with Ivanpah;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
we depend on third-party relationships to produce components in our system, which may subject us to risks that such third parties do not fulfill their obligations to us under our arrangements with them;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
the timely completion of upgrades by SCE to the existing transmission interconnection to accommodate the increased electrical production from Ivanpah, which if delayed could limit the amount of electricity produced at Ivanpah;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
once implemented at utility scale, our solar thermal technology may perform below expectations, which may implicate the production guarantees in our construction and supply contracts with Ivanpah; and

 
15
Table of Contents

 	Ÿ	 	
if Ivanpah fails to comply with its permits, including those relating to protection of the environment and natural resources, or if unexpected conditions are encountered during construction or operation that require that these permits be re-evaluated, Ivanpah may be required to halt or delay construction or operation.

Once construction is completed, Ivanpah will be operated by NRG Solar, and therefore we will have limited influence over Ivanpah’s future operations. If the construction and operation of Ivanpah are not successful, we may be unable to grow our business to a sufficient scale necessary to improve our results of operations and achieve profitability.
Furthermore, adoption of our systems for use in solar-to-steam applications, such as thermal EOR, depends on the successful implementation and operation of the 29 MWth EOR project for Chevron in Coalinga, California that began operations in October 2011. We have experienced significant cost overruns related to the project construction. If the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project does not meet expectations, our ability to sell additional thermal EOR systems may be negatively impacted.
We may be required to fund cost overruns over the funded reserves for the completion of Ivanpah.
If Ivanpah’s costs exceed the budgeted amount, we, along with the other equity owners of Ivanpah, have committed to funding up to $66.5 million of overrun contingency reserves, known as the funded overrun equity. To the extent Ivanpah’s cost overruns exceed the funded overrun equity, we are responsible for all further cost overruns. Cost overruns may occur if completing the portion of Ivanpah construction that is within our scope of responsibility costs more than expected, or when one of Ivanpah’s contractors or suppliers encounter unexpected cost increases that entitle them to relief from their fixed-price contracts. If we are required to fund cost overruns over and above the funded overrun equity, we will not be entitled to recover this additional funding through future distributions from Ivanpah to the equity owners.
We may not be able to finance the growth of our business, which we expect will require significant amounts of capital, including the development and construction of solar thermal energy projects using our systems.
We are in a capital-intensive business and have relied heavily on debt and equity issuances and government grants and loan guarantees to finance the development and construction of our projects and other projected capital expenditures. For the projects where we lead development, we expect to own initially 100% of the equity in the projects, but may seek development partners on specific projects. We intend to ultimately transfer the majority of the equity in these projects to third parties while retaining a minority equity interest. Completion of our projects requires significant capital expenditures and construction costs. For example, in April 2011, we closed an approximately $2.2 billion financing for the construction of Ivanpah. Recovery of the capital investment in a solar thermal energy project generally occurs over a long period of time. As a result, we must obtain funds from equity or debt financings, including tax equity transactions, or from government grants to help develop and construct our existing project pipeline, to help finance the acquisition of system components, to help identify and develop new projects, to help fund research and development expenses and to help pay the general and administrative costs of operating our business. We may not be able to obtain the needed funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all. For example, Ivanpah was primarily financed by a $1.6 billion loan, guaranteed by the DOE and funded by the Federal Financing Bank, a branch of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the U.S. Treasury, but government funding may not be available to finance future projects. Furthermore, because we rely on debt financing to develop our projects, increases in long-term interest rates could significantly increase our cost of capital. If we are unable to
 
16
Table of Contents

raise additional funds when needed, our project companies could be required to delay development and construction of projects, reduce the scope of projects or abandon or sell some or all of their development projects or default on our contractual commitments in the future, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We depend heavily on federal, state and local government support for renewable energy sources, which is subject to change.
We depend heavily on government policies that support renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of developing solar energy projects. Renewable energy sources currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives such as investment tax credits, or ITCs, cash grants in lieu of ITCs, loan guarantees, renewables portfolio standard programs, or RPS programs, modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation and bonus depreciation. For example, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, provides an ITC of 30% of the cost-basis of an eligible resource, including solar thermal energy projects placed in service prior to the end of 2016. Additionally, many states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy. However, the regulations that govern the RPS programs, including pricing incentives for renewable energy, or reasonableness guidelines for pricing that increase valuation compared to conventional power (such as a projected value for carbon reduction or consideration of avoided integration costs), may change. If the RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, we could sustain fewer future power contracts or receive lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our project development plans. Such material adverse effects may result from decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing. Furthermore, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, included over $80 billion in incentives to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector, such as cash grants in lieu of ITCs, bonus depreciation and expansion of the DOE loan guarantee program. Although the ARRA expanded the DOE loan guarantee program, this program faces challenges and may not continue past the projects already financed such as Ivanpah. In addition, the cash grant in lieu of ITCs program only applies to projects that commenced construction prior to December 31, 2011.
Our industry is rapidly evolving and highly competitive and failure to further refine and develop improved technologies could render our solar thermal technology obsolete and reduce our sales and market share relative to other renewable energy sources.
The renewable energy industry is highly competitive, and if we fail to identify and adapt to new technologies, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to remain competitive, we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry. However, returns on research and development activities are inherently uncertain, and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results. Our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits. Other companies are developing a variety of competing solar energy technologies, including crystalline silicon and thin film technologies, that could produce solar energy systems that may prove more cost-effective or more efficient than our technology. As a result, if we do not execute on our technology roadmap as planned, our solar thermal technology may be rendered obsolete by the technological advances of others, which could reduce our revenue and market share.

Our ability to execute on our existing and future pipeline of PPAs and solar-to-steam contracts, as well as our ability to sell our systems, depends in large part on locating suitable sites, securing site control, obtaining and complying with necessary governmental approvals and permits and administering key milestones and deliverables, the failure of which would adversely affect our business.
Our ability to convert our PPAs and solar-to-steam contracts into sales of systems using our technology depends in large part on locating sites suitable for construction of a solar thermal energy project, securing site control, obtaining necessary governmental approvals and permits and administering key milestones and deliverables. Electric power plants using our systems must be interconnected to electricity transmission, gas transmission and distribution networks. For example, our PPAs require specific interconnection points for the transmission of electricity and if our project companies are unable to connect at such points, we may have to seek the counterparty’s approval or amend or renegotiate the PPA, or the PPA could be terminated. Solar thermal energy projects using our systems must also secure an adequate water supply primarily for periodic washing of heliostats.
Once projects using our systems have identified a suitable operating site, obtaining the necessary land rights requires negotiation with landowners and local government officials, which can take a long period of time, is not always successful and sometimes requires economic concessions not originally planned. The design, construction and operation of solar thermal energy projects are highly regulated, require various governmental approvals and permits, including environmental approvals and permits, and may be subject to the imposition of conditions that vary by jurisdiction. In some cases, these approvals and permits require periodic renewal. In addition, third-party permits may be required for transmission upgrades needed to deliver electricity from our projects, and such transmission is also highly regulated and requires various governmental approvals and permits, including environmental approvals and permits. We cannot predict whether all approvals and permits required for a given project will be granted or whether the conditions associated with the approvals and permits will be achievable or financially practicable. The denial of an approval or a permit essential to a project or the imposition of impractical conditions on a project would impair our ability to develop projects necessary to meet the commercial operation deadlines under our PPAs. In addition, we cannot predict whether the approvals and permits will attract significant opposition or whether the permitting process will be lengthened due to complexities of appeals or litigation by local, state or federal parties.
Our project companies have experienced delays in developing projects due to delays in obtaining permits and may experience delays in the future. This delay in the review and permitting process for a project can impair the ability to develop a project or increase the cost so substantially that the project is no longer attractive to us or the owners of projects using our systems. If we were to commence construction in anticipation of our project companies obtaining the final permits needed for a project, we would be subject to the risk of being unable to complete the project if all the permits were not obtained. If this were to occur, we would likely lose a significant portion of our investment in the project company and could incur a loss as a result. Any failure to procure and maintain necessary permits would adversely affect ongoing development, construction and operation of projects using our systems.
Furthermore, federal and state environmental legislation and regulations are subject to change, and future requirements may include stricter standards and enforcement, as well as more stringent fines and penalties for non-compliance. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their directors, officers and employees. The cost of compliance with changes in governmental regulations has a potential to reduce the profitability of our operations.
If our project companies are unable to obtain adequate property rights for a project, including its interconnection rights, such project may be smaller in size or potentially unfeasible. The property rights necessary to construct and interconnect projects using our systems must also be insurable and
 
18
Table of Contents

otherwise satisfactory to the financing counterparties. Failure to obtain insurable property rights for a project satisfactory to our project companies’ financing counterparties would preclude our ability to obtain third-party financing and could prevent ongoing development and construction of such project. We could also incur losses as a result of development costs for sites that are not completed, which we would have to write off.
Finally, executing on our PPAs requires identifying, tracking and administering key milestones and deliverables set forth in the PPAs. Failure to do so could result in penalties or termination under the terms of the PPAs, or we may have to seek to amend or renegotiate the PPA.
Current or future litigation or administrative proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have been, and continue to be, involved in legal proceedings, administrative proceedings, claims and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. Individuals and interest groups may choose to litigate the issuance of a permit for a solar thermal energy project or seek to enjoin construction of a solar thermal energy project, among other potential issues. For example, in January 2011, two lawsuits were filed claiming that the permitting process for Ivanpah did not comply with various federal requirements; while the first of these challenged four large-scale projects, the second focused on Ivanpah alone. While we believe the claims are without merit, unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to these or future proceedings, such as judgments for monetary damages, injunctions or denial or revocation of permits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, settlement of claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.”
We face competition from both more established renewable energy generation developers and traditional energy companies and we may not be successful in competing in this industry.
We compete with other renewable energy companies and developers as well as traditional energy companies and developers, which may have greater financial and other resources than we do. Our project companies compete with other solar companies primarily for sites with high levels of direct sunlight that can be built in a cost-effective manner, and with other energy companies for access to transmission or distribution networks. We also compete with other renewable energy developers for the limited pool of personnel with requisite industry knowledge and experience.
The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development, and the extent to which solar thermal technology will be widely adopted by purchasers of electricity or the EOR industry is uncertain. If our solar thermal technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption or if demand for our solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to grow our business beyond our signed PPAs or generate sufficient sales to achieve and then sustain profitability. Renewable energy companies are competing intensely to meet the needs of utilities to provide power during periods of peak demand, in part, we believe, because utilities may be willing to pay more for reliable power on-peak than for power that is less reliable and/or delivered off-peak. Other renewable energy sources, or other technologies designed to enhance reliability of power supply during periods of peak load for utilities, may exceed our systems’ capabilities in meeting this on-peak demand. We believe our systems provide a cost-competitive solution with characteristics that are more valuable to utilities than other renewable energy technologies; however, if other sources or technologies are better able to meet the utilities’ needs, or the utilities prove unwilling to pay more for reliable on-peak power, our ability to enter economically feasible long-term PPAs in the future may be adversely affected.
Depending on the regulatory framework and market dynamics of a region, we may also compete with other renewable energy producers or traditional electricity producers when we bid on or negotiate
 
19
Table of Contents

for a long-term PPA. Furthermore, technological progress in traditional forms of electricity generation or the discovery of large new deposits of traditional fuels could reduce the cost of electricity generated from those sources and as a consequence reduce the demand for electricity from renewable energy sources, or render existing or future solar thermal energy projects uncompetitive. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Electric power plants using our systems to generate electricity rely on national and regional transmission systems and related facilities that are owned and operated by third parties and have both regulatory and physical constraints impeding access to electric markets.
Electric power plants using our systems to generate electricity in both domestic and international regions depend on electric transmission systems and related facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity we generate and have both regulatory and physical constraints impeding access to electric markets. Electric power plants using our systems may have limited or no access to interconnection and transmission capacity at reasonable costs or in a timely fashion, because there may not be transmission capacity available or there are many parties seeking access to the limited capacity that is available. In addition, certain PPAs we have entered into contain provisions that limit, or cap, the maximum allowable transmission costs under such PPAs, which may have the effect of increasing total project costs for electric power plants using our systems. The inability to secure access to capacity at reasonable costs, in a timely fashion or at all, could cause delays and require renegotiation of key PPA terms. Any such increased costs and delays could, in turn, delay the commercial operation dates of, or could result in termination of the PPAs associated with, electric power plants using our systems and negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.
We may be unable to construct our solar thermal projects on time, and our construction costs could increase to levels that make a project too expensive to complete or make the return on our investment in that project less than expected.
Ivanpah is the first utility-scale solar thermal power project using our technology, and we anticipate that our subsequent projects will be more cost-efficient as we gain further experience in constructing large-scale projects. However, there may be delays or unexpected developments in completing our solar thermal projects, which could cause the construction costs of these projects to exceed our expectations. Projects using our systems and where we have an ownership interest may suffer significant construction delays or construction-cost increases as a result of a variety of factors, including:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
failure to complete interconnection to transmission networks;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
failure to secure and maintain environmental and other permits or regulatory approvals;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
appeals of environmental and other permits or approvals that we obtain;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
failure to obtain capital;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
failure to obtain all necessary rights to land access and use;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
failure to receive critical components and equipment that meet our design specifications;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
delays in scheduled deliveries of critical components and equipment;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
failure to receive quality and timely performance from key contractors and vendors;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
increases in supplier costs, including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or commodity prices;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
work stoppages or shortages of skilled labor;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
inclement weather conditions;

 
20
Table of Contents

 	Ÿ	 	
adverse environmental and geological conditions; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
force majeure or other events out of our control.

Any of these factors could give rise to construction delays and construction costs in excess of our expectations. This could prevent the project from completing construction or cause significant delays, causing defaults under the project financing agreements or under PPAs that require completion of project construction by a certain time, cause the project to be unprofitable for us or otherwise impair our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we cannot continue to develop projects to satisfy our PPAs, our ability to sell our systems will be negatively impacted and we may have significant write-offs.
If new projects fail to be completed on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to satisfy the obligations under our PPAs. Because completing the projects in our development pipeline as anticipated, or at all, involves numerous risks and uncertainties, some projects in our portfolio may not progress to construction or may be substantially delayed. From time to time, we may have to abandon and write off projects on which we have started development. In addition, those projects that are constructed and begin operations may not meet investors’ return expectations due to schedule delays, cost overruns or revenue shortfalls or they may not generate the capacity that we anticipate or result in receipt of revenue from system sales in the originally anticipated time period or at all. An inability to maintain our development pipeline or to convert those projects into financially successful operating projects that purchase our system and satisfy our PPAs would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, in the future.
Strategic business relationships will be an important factor in the growth and success of our business, particularly internationally. We have entered into business partnership agreements with Alstom, one of our major stockholders, to jointly market and bid on projects to design and construct solar thermal power plants in the Middle East, Northern Africa, South Africa, Southern Europe, India, Australia and potentially other locations as we see fit. Furthermore, we recently completed a solar-to-steam EOR demonstration facility for Chevron, which is also one of our stockholders. Lastly, we selected Bechtel as the EPC contractor for Ivanpah. Bechtel also funded a portion of our equity commitment for each of the three phases of Ivanpah pursuant to a loan agreement and is providing additional preliminary engineering work in support of our development efforts on our next projects.
There are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure additional business relationship opportunities in the future or maintain our existing relationships. Our competitors also may capitalize on such opportunities before we do. We may not be able to offer similar benefits to other companies that we would like to establish and maintain strategic relationships with which could impair our ability to establish such relationships. Moreover, identifying such opportunities could demand substantial management time and resources, and negotiating and financing relationships involves significant costs and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully identify and execute on strategic relationship opportunities in the future, our overall growth could be impaired and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.
Negative public or community response to solar thermal projects could adversely affect widespread adoption of systems using our technology.
Negative public or community response to solar thermal energy projects could adversely affect our ability to sell our systems to projects using our technology and our project companies’ ability to
 
21
Table of Contents

develop, construct and operate their projects. This type of negative response could lead to legal, public relations and other challenges that impede our project companies’ ability to meet our development and construction targets, achieve commercial operations for a project on schedule and generate revenues. For example, Ivanpah has been, and continues to be, the subject of administrative and legal challenges from groups concerned with potential environmental impacts (e.g., impacts on the California desert tortoise and other wildlife species affected by Ivanpah), archaeological or cultural impacts or impacts on the natural beauty of public lands. We expect this type of opposition to continue as we develop and construct existing and future projects using our systems. An increase in opposition to our requests for permits or successful challenges or appeals to permits issued to us could materially adversely affect our development plans. If we are unable to develop and construct the production capacity to the scale that we expect from our development projects in our anticipated timeframes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Our industry is characterized by a limited number of purchasers for utility-scale quantities of electricity and solar steam, which restricts our ability to negotiate PPAs and solar-to-steam contracts and could expose us and projects that use our systems to additional risk.
Our industry has a limited number of possible purchasers for utility-scale quantities of electricity in a given geographic location, including investor-owned power companies, public utility districts and cooperatives, as well as a limited number of possible purchasers for utility-scale quantities of solar steam that are located in areas in which we could economically produce that steam. As a result, there is a concentrated pool of potential buyers for projects using our systems that generate utility-scale quantities of electricity or solar steam, which may restrict our ability to negotiate favorable terms under new PPAs or solar-to-steam contracts and could impact our ability to find new customers for our system sales. Furthermore, if the financial condition of these utilities, power purchasers and/or steam purchasers deteriorated or the RPS and climate change programs to which they are currently subject changed, demand for electricity or solar steam generated by projects using our systems could be negatively impacted. The willingness of utilities to purchase electricity from an independent power producer may be based on a number of factors and not solely on pricing and predictability of supply. If we cannot enter into PPAs or solar-to-steam contracts on terms favorable to us, or at all, it would negatively impact our revenue and our decisions regarding development of additional projects to support sales of our systems.
Some of our PPAs have not yet been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission.
In order to be fully effective, each of our PPAs must be approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC. It is the obligation of the utility entering into the PPA to obtain such approval. Through our project companies, we have 13 executed and outstanding PPAs with PG&E and SCE. Three of the PPAs are associated with Ivanpah and have been approved by the CPUC, and we retain 10 PPAs to deliver approximately 2.0 GW of installed capacity, of which five have been approved by the CPUC. With respect to the remaining PPAs requiring CPUC approval, in October 2011, we executed five amended and restated PPAs with SCE. These PPAs were submitted to the CPUC for approval in November 2011. If the five amended and restated PPAs are not approved by the CPUC, they will be subject to termination by either party thereto, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Pursuant to the terms of each of our existing PPAs, the failure to fulfill the performance requirements may require renegotiation, or result in the imposition of penalties or termination of the PPA.
Pursuant to the terms of the PPAs that we have entered into with PG&E and SCE, under which project companies we have formed will sell electrical output, we have deposited funds under each PPA
 
22
Table of Contents

to secure the respective project company’s obligations thereunder. The amounts we have deposited under each of our ten existing PPAs that are not associated with Ivanpah range up to $7 million, with total deposits of approximately $51 million to date. If we do not meet certain development milestones specified in the PPAs, the project company may be declared to have committed an event of default under the PPA and the entire deposit amount may be forfeited as a penalty for failure to perform. If we anticipate or experience delays in obtaining permits, regulatory approvals, ordering major equipment, commencing construction, completing transmission network upgrades or establishing interconnection facilities, we may need to amend a PPA to provide additional time to satisfy a performance requirement. If we cannot negotiate an amendment, we may experience an event of default. If an event of default occurs, and we are unable to renegotiate the terms of the PPA, the PPA may be terminated. Any renegotiation of a PPA may result in terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, the parties may interpret the PPA requirements differently, which could lead to a dispute resolution process that could result in an unfavorable decision for either party. After we sell majority control of a project company to third parties, the related PPA security deposits are the responsibility of the project company and its owners. However, any forfeiture and event of default, or termination, whether before or after we sell majority control of the project company to third parties, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow.
The Ivanpah Treasury Cash Grant could be recaptured by the government.
The economics of Ivanpah are heavily influenced by the assumed full receipt of U.S. Department of the Treasury cash grants, or Treasury Cash Grant, aggregating approximately $570 million. The U.S. Treasury is generally required to pay the Treasury Cash Grant by the later of sixty days after a project is placed into service or sixty days after the date on which an application is submitted. After receiving a Treasury Cash Grant, the grant may be recaptured by the government if, within five years of the date the project is placed in service, any interest in the project or company is transferred to certain prohibited persons, the equipment ceases to be specified energy property or the equipment is taken out of service (other than due to an “act of God”). Specified energy property includes only tangible property (not including a building or its structural components) for which depreciation, or amortization in lieu of depreciation, is allowable. The Treasury Cash Grant program currently is available only to projects that had commenced construction by December 31, 2011, and this program was not extended.
There is no guarantee that the U.S. Treasury or the tax law will recognize the cost basis that we claim in a project’s specified energy property. If the U.S. Treasury concludes that the true cost of any specified energy property is lower than the cost of that property claimed by the project companies in which we have an ownership interest, then the U.S. Treasury may seek to reduce the amount of the Treasury Cash Grant that it pays to the project.
We are subject to credit and performance risk from third parties under service and supply contracts.
We enter into contracts with vendors to supply equipment, materials and other goods and services for our proprietary technology and the development and construction of solar thermal energy projects. If vendors do not perform their obligations, we may have to enter into new contracts with other vendors at a higher cost or may have schedule disruptions affecting the amount of time and expense required to complete a project. For example, some of our key components for Ivanpah, including boilers from Riley and turbines from Siemens, are available from a limited or sole source of supply. Replacement of these components, where possible, may involve long lead times and result in a delay in fulfilling our obligations to projects using our systems.
When we purchase third-party solar system components, we also enter into warranty agreements with the manufacturer. However, there can be no assurance that the manufacturer will be able to fulfill
 
23
Table of Contents

its contractual obligations. In addition, these warranties generally expire within 12 to 24 months after the component delivery date or the date the component is commissioned. If we seek warranty protection and the manufacturer is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the warranty, whether as a result of the manufacturer’s financial condition or otherwise, or if the term of the warranty has expired, we may suffer reduced warranty availability for the affected components, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, under such warranties, the warranty payments by the manufacturer are typically subject to an aggregate maximum cap that is a portion of the total purchase price of the components. Losses in excess of these caps may be our responsibility.
The loss of one or more members of our senior management or key employees may adversely affect our ability to implement our strategy.
We depend on our experienced management team and the loss of one or more key executives could have a negative impact on our business. We also depend on our ability to retain and motivate key employees and attract qualified new employees. Because the utility-scale solar industry is relatively new, there is a scarcity of top-quality employees with requisite experience, especially experience in the solar thermal energy industry. If we lose a member of the management team or a key employee, we may not be able to replace him or her. Integrating new employees into our management and engineering teams and training new employees with no prior experience in the solar thermal energy industry could prove disruptive to our operations, require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful. An inability to attract and retain sufficient technical and managerial personnel could limit or delay our development efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Problems with system component quality or performance at Ivanpah may cause us to incur solar field and receiver system warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue to decline.
The materials and equipment we provide to Ivanpah will be warranted by us to be free of defects in workmanship and materials for a period of 48 months following the achievement of substantial completion under the EPC contract applicable to each Ivanpah project. All warranty work includes the cost of removal, disassembly, repair, replacement and reassembly of the warranted items. Repaired or replaced work is re-warranted for an additional 12-month period or the remainder of the original 48-month warranty period, whichever is longer, subject to a limitation that no warranty shall extend beyond 12 months following expiration of the original 48-month warranty period. We guarantee that each solar field and boiler at Ivanpah will provide sufficient steam output (at specified steam conditions set forth in the applicable EPC contract) to achieve substantial completion by the guaranteed substantial completion date. We further guarantee the achievement of at least 95% of projected plant electrical generation during at least one of the first four years of commercial operation. This guarantee excludes lost electrical generation unrelated to the solar energy system design, solar field equipment or the boiler, due to the impact of weather conditions, or due to work or services provided by others (not under subcontract to BrightSource), but will not be subject to any sublimit of liability other than the aggregate limitation of liability (100% of the contract value) under each solar field agreement between us and the project. In addition, we will provide a 48-month serial defect warranty with respect to the pylons, mirrors, pad bonds, worm and elevation drives. In the event that 20% of any such warranted items have an identical defect, a rebuttable presumption will arise that 100% of all such items are defective.
Because of the limited operating history of our solar thermal systems, we have been required to make assumptions and apply judgments regarding a number of factors, including our anticipated rate of warranty claims, the durability and reliability of our systems and the performance of our equipment,
 
24
Table of Contents

including heliostats in the field. Our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual long-term performance of our systems, resulting in significant operational problems for us including increased maintenance costs and inability to meet energy delivery requirements or defaults under project or financing documents. For example, a severe wind storm in late November 2011 at the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project resulted in movement in some of the pylons on which the heliostats are mounted. As a result, we are deploying redesigned pylons in much of the Ivanpah project. Any similar widespread system or component failures may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue to decline. In addition, while we have obtained warranty insurance, such insurance is subject to certain deductibles, recoveries under such insurance could be disputed and certain valid warranty claims may be specifically excluded from such insurance.
The production of solar energy depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions. If solar conditions are unfavorable, our electricity production, and therefore revenue from projects using our systems, may be substantially below our expectations.
The electricity produced and revenues generated by a solar energy project will be highly dependent on suitable solar conditions and associated weather conditions, which are beyond our control. Furthermore, components of our system, such as the heliostats, could be damaged by severe weather, such as hailstorms or tornadoes. Unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions could impair the effectiveness or require shutdown of key equipment, impeding operation of our projects, which would result in reduced energy production and decreased revenues and, if these problems persist, potential payments, deductions or defaults under key project documents, including our projects’ PPAs or other financing arrangements.
In the long term, we intend to expand our international activities, which will subject us to a number of risks.
Our long-term strategic plans include international expansion, such as through our pre-disclosed partnership with Alstom to jointly market and bid on projects in the Middle East, Northern Africa, South Africa, Southern Europe, India and Australia. We intend to sell our proprietary technology system and develop, construct and sell our solar thermal system in international locations. Risks inherent to international operations include the following:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
inability to work successfully with third parties having local expertise to co-develop international projects;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations, including export and import restrictions, tax laws and regulations, environmental regulations, labor laws and other government requirements, approvals, permits and licenses;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
difficulties in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
difficulties in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
changes in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate, including changes in government incentives relating to power generation and solar electricity;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
political and economic instability, including wars, acts of terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailments of trade and other business restrictions;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
difficulties and costs in recruiting and retaining individuals skilled in international business operations;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
international business practices that may conflict with U.S. customs or legal requirements;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
financial risks, such as longer sales and payment cycles and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable;

 
25
Table of Contents

 	Ÿ	 	
fluctuations in currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights.

Doing business in foreign markets requires us to be able to respond to rapid changes in market, legal and political conditions in these countries. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political environments. We may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business.
Political, economic and security conditions in Israel, where all of the product research and development, engineering services and solar field supply chain management for our systems are located, may adversely affect our operations and may limit our ability to sell our systems.
Our Israeli subsidiary provides substantially all of the product research and development, engineering services and procurement functions for our systems, including heliostats, solar boilers and control systems for all of our solar fields. Political, economic and security conditions in Israel directly affect our subsidiary employees and operations. There has been ongoing violence, primarily in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We could be adversely affected by hostilities involving Israel, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. In addition, the sale of products manufactured in Israel may be adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws, policies or practices directed toward Israel or companies having operations in Israel.
In addition, some of our employees in Israel are subject to being called on to perform military service and their absence may have an adverse effect upon our operations. Generally, unless exempt, male adult citizens of Israel under the age of 41 are obligated to perform up to 36 days of military reserve duty annually and all such citizens are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances.
These events and conditions could disrupt our operations in Israel, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.
We are an international organization and we could be obligated to pay taxes in various jurisdictions.
Historically, our foreign operations have been located in Israel, but we anticipate expanding into other foreign jurisdictions in the future. As an international organization we will be subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our foreign subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations.
Taxing authorities could reallocate our taxable income among our subsidiaries which could increase our consolidated tax liability.
We intend to conduct operations worldwide through subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws or regulations of each
 
26
Table of Contents

country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arm’s length and that contemporaneous documentation is maintained to support the transfer prices. On that basis, tax authorities could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which may result in a higher tax liability to us and possibly result in two countries taxing the same income, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Proposed and enacted U.S. federal income tax legislation could negatively impact our effective tax rate.
Recent changes to U.S. tax law as well as other proposed tax legislation that could be enacted in the future could substantially impact the tax treatment of our non-U.S. earnings. These proposed and enacted changes include limitations on the ability to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and deferral of interest expense deductions until non-U.S. earnings are repatriated to the United States. Such legislation could negatively impact the amount of taxes payable in the United States and our effective tax rate and possibly adversely affect our results of operations.
Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.
Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar solar thermal technology more quickly than anticipated, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We primarily rely on a combination of trade secrets and contractual rights, including employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary information and know-how. We also maintain a growing patent portfolio that as of February 29, 2012 consisted of nine issued U.S. patents (including one patent covering dynamic system optimization and another covering integration of solar thermal systems and PV, both of which were issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the second half of 2011, and one patent covering heliostat design) and numerous patent applications, which included on the above date 11 patent applications covering solar field optimization and control, six patent applications covering our operating methods, seven patent applications covering heliostat and receiver design and three patent applications covering thermal energy storage.
The protection provided by the intellectual property laws and contractual rights may be important to our future opportunities. However, the measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others afford only limited protection and may not be effective. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult.
We may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to us, could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the construction and sale of our solar thermal facilities or the use of our value added system technology.
The technology incorporated into and used to develop and construct our current and future systems may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others. Should the outcome of any such claims be unfavorable, we could be required to pay the plaintiff(s) damages and potentially be enjoined from using what the plaintiff(s) claim is their property or confidential information unless we enter into a mutually suitable arrangement. As a result, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our projects could be materially and adversely affected. Third

parties may allege that our projects infringe patents, trademarks or copyrights, or that we have misappropriated trade secrets, and such parties could have significantly more resources to devote to any resulting enforcement actions. These allegations could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management. If a claim were brought against us, and we were found to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, or be enjoined from using the technology deemed to be infringing or using or constructing systems deemed to be infringing, which could significantly delay construction and/or operation of our projects. In addition, we may need to attempt to license the intellectual property rights from the patent holder or spend time and money to design around or avoid the intellectual property infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and efforts to design around or avoid the intellectual property may be unsuccessful.
We, our partners and project companies may rely on specialized structured financing arrangements to realize the benefits provided by ITCs and accelerated tax depreciation. These arrangements may limit the cash distributions we receive.
Our project companies may enter into tax equity financing transactions in which they would receive investments from tax equity investors when our projects are placed in service in return for tax benefits in our project companies. Until the tax equity investors achieve their agreed upon rate of return, they may be entitled to substantially all of the applicable project’s operating cash flow from electricity sales and related hedging activities, as well as substantially all of the project’s ITCs, accelerated depreciation and taxable income or loss. Typically, project sponsors structure tax equity financing transactions so that the tax equity investors reach their target return between five and ten years after the applicable project achieves commercial operation.
As a result, a tax equity financing may substantially reduce the cash distributions from the applicable project available to us for other uses, and the period during which the tax equity investors receive most of the cash distributions from electricity sales may last longer than expected if our solar thermal energy projects perform below our expectations.
The ability of our project companies to enter into tax equity arrangements in the future depends heavily on the extension of the expiration date or renewal of the ITCs, without which the market for tax equity financing would possibly cease to exist. Moreover, there is a limited amount of tax equity investment capital and a limited number of potential tax equity investors. Solar thermal energy developers must compete with other renewable energy developers and others for tax equity financing. In addition, conditions in financial and credit markets generally may result in the contraction of available tax equity financing. As the renewable energy industry expands, the cost of tax equity financing may increase and there may not be sufficient tax equity financing available to meet the total demand in any year. If our project companies are unable to enter into tax equity financing agreements with attractive pricing terms, or at all, they may not be able to use the tax benefits provided by ITCs and accelerated tax depreciation in the manner they do so today, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes to financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations and cause us to change our business practices.
We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these accounting standards or the questioning of current reporting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

We are not able to insure against all potential risks and may become subject to higher insurance premiums.
Our business is exposed to the risks inherent in the development, construction and operation of solar thermal energy projects, such as breakdowns, manufacturing defects, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and sabotage. We are also exposed to environmental risks. We have insurance policies covering certain risks associated with our business. Our insurance policies, however, do not cover losses as a result of force majeure, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or sabotage, among other things. We generally do not maintain insurance for certain environmental risks, such as environmental contamination. In addition, our insurance policies are subject to annual review by our insurers and may not be renewed at all or on similar or favorable terms. A serious uninsured loss or a loss significantly exceeding the limits of our insurance policies or the failure to renew our insurance policies on similar or favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.
In general, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in connection with or after this offering, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are beyond our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of any companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.
Our largely unproven mirror cleaning equipment may perform below our expectations.
The primary maintenance activity for solar thermal projects using our systems will be the routine and continuous washing of reflective mirror surfaces. We anticipate each mirror may need to be cleaned every two weeks to prevent a buildup of dust which would significantly degrade the system performance. Mirrors will be washed by a dedicated crew using specialized mobile equipment. We are still designing and testing the specialized equipment to be used in this process. If the mirror washing equipment and process are not effective, actual operating costs may be substantially higher than forecasted or total electrical production may fall short of estimates.
Our headquarters and some of our development sites are located in active earthquake zones, and an earthquake or other types of natural disasters affecting us or our suppliers could cause resource shortages and disrupt and harm our results of operations.
We conduct our executive and administrative operations in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is an active earthquake zone, and certain of our project companies, development sites and suppliers conduct their operations in the same region or in other locations that are susceptible to natural disasters. In addition, California and some of the locations where certain of our suppliers are located, from time to time, have experienced shortages of water, electric power and natural gas. The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, drought, flood or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages, affecting us or our suppliers, could cause a significant interruption in our business, damage or destroy our facilities or those of our suppliers or the manufacturing equipment or inventory of our suppliers, and cause us to incur significant costs, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The insurance we maintain against fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case.

Risks Related to This Offering and Ownership of Our Common Stock
Our share price may be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the initial public offering price.
The initial public offering price for our shares will be determined by negotiations between us and representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
unanticipated development or construction delays or other changes in our project plans;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
adverse announcements regarding systems performance;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
reductions in the retail price of electricity, to the extent projects are negotiating PPAs;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
additions to or departures of key personnel;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after this offering or updates or changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
the inability to meet the financial estimates of securities analysts;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
disputes or other developments related to our intellectual property rights, including litigation, and our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
changes in laws, regulations and policies applicable to our business and products, particularly those relating to government incentives for solar energy;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
market conditions in our industry and industries of our customers; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
general economic and market conditions.

Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. If the market price of shares of our common stock after this offering does not exceed the initial public offering price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, certain companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.
There has been no prior market for our common stock and an active trading market may not develop.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. An active trading market may not develop following the completion of this offering or, if developed, may not be

sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares of common stock at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value and increase the volatility of your shares of common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares of common stock as consideration.
We expect to incur increased costs and our management will face increased demands as a result of operating as a public company, including the costs to establish and maintain effective internal controls and remediate an existing material weakness.
We have never operated as a public company. As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, internal controls over financial reporting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as related rules implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.
In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, or will require, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we will be required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For example, we and our independent registered public accounting firm have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to the preparation of our consolidated statement of cash flows that has resulted in restatements to historical financial statements. We are currently in the process of remediating the material weakness. Our remediation plan includes, among other things, hiring additional accounting staff, enhancing our internal review procedures during the financial statement close process, providing additional technical training to key finance and accounting personnel and updating related control procedures to specifically address the identified control deficiencies. These activities are ongoing and management anticipates completing our remediation activities during the first half of 2012. Remediating this material weakness and maintaining proper and effective internal controls will require substantial management time and attention and may result in our incurring substantial incremental expenses.
In future periods, if the process required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other evaluation and testing of our internal controls reveal any other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, the correction of any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could require additional remedial measures or future restatements that could be costly and time-consuming. In addition, we cannot be certain that restatements will not occur in the future. Any restatements could create a strain on our internal resources and cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results. Failure to have effective internal financial and accounting controls could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, and we may be unable to produce accurate financial reporting and disclosures on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.
Upon completion of this offering and the concurrent private placements, our executive officers, directors and their affiliates will beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 33.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In particular, VantagePoint Capital Partners will beneficially own approximately 18.6% and Alstom will beneficially own approximately 21.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of this offering and the concurrent private placements. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as restrictions and covenants in our DOE-guaranteed loan facility, could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be effective upon the completion of this offering will contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents will include the following provisions:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
establishing a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
requiring that directors only be removed for cause; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
limiting the determination to our board of directors then in office with respect to the number of directors on our board and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board.

As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without the prior approval of our board of directors or the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.
These provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, alone or together, could delay or deter hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

Purchasers in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the book value of their investment.
The initial public offering price of our common stock is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our outstanding common stock immediately after this offering. Therefore, if you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of your investment. Based upon the issuance and sale of 6,900,000 shares of common stock by us in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) and 3,409,090 shares of common stock by us in the concurrent private placements, you will incur immediate dilution of approximately $11.93 in the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share if you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering.
In addition, following this offering and the concurrent private placements, purchasers in this offering will have contributed 20% of the total consideration paid by our stockholders to purchase shares of common stock, in exchange for acquiring approximately 15% of our total outstanding shares as of December 31, 2011 after giving effect to this offering and the concurrent private placements.
As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding options and warrants to purchase approximately 3,090,212 shares of common stock with exercise prices that are below the assumed initial public offering price of the common stock. To the extent that these options and warrants are exercised, you will experience further dilution.
You may experience dilution of your ownership interest due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
We are in a capital intensive business, and may not have sufficient funds to finance the growth of our business, the construction costs of our development projects or to support our projected capital expenditures. As a result, we will require additional funds from further equity or debt financings, including tax equity financing transactions or sales of preferred shares or convertible debt to complete the development of new projects and pay the general and administrative costs of our business. In the future, we may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of purchasers of common stock offered hereby. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, we will be authorized to issue 760,000,000 shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or convertible debt may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in future public offerings or private placements for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes, potentially at an offering price, conversion price or exercise price that is below the offering price for common stock in this offering.
A significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the public market in the future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time after the expiration of the lock-up agreements described in the “Underwriting” and “Shares Eligible for Future Sale” sections of this prospectus. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. After this offering and the concurrent private placements, we will have 45,448,425 shares of common stock outstanding (assuming an initial public offering price at the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus). This includes the 6,900,000 shares that we are

selling in this offering (plus any shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares), which may be resold in the public market immediately. The remaining 38,548,425 shares, or 85% of our outstanding shares after this offering and the concurrent private placements, are currently restricted as a result of securities laws or lock-up agreements but will be able to be sold upon the expiration of lock-up agreements, subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.
The lock-up agreements expire 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except that the 180-day period may be extended in certain cases for up to 33 additional days under certain circumstances where we announce or pre-announce earnings or a material event occurs within 17 days prior to, or 15 days after, the termination of the 180-day period. Goldman, Sachs & Co. may, with our consent, and at any time without notice, release all or any portion of the securities subject to lock-up agreements. The shares to be sold in the concurrent private placements are subject to the holding period requirements of Rule 144, and are therefore subject to a six month holding requirement before such shares can be sold in a non-registered transaction.
Following this offering, holders of 33,478,990 shares of our common stock (including the shares sold in the concurrent private placements) not sold in this offering and holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 108,590 shares of common stock not sold in this offering will be entitled to rights with respect to the registration of these shares under the Securities Act. See “Description of Capital Stock—Registration Rights.” If we register their shares of common stock following the expiration of the lock-up agreements, these stockholders could sell those shares in the public market without being subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 and Rule 701.
After the completion of this offering and the concurrent private placements, we intend to register approximately 10,328,693 shares of common stock that have been reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans. Of these shares, 1,897,409 shares will be eligible for sale upon the exercise of outstanding options that will be vested after the expiration of the lock-up agreements.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we receive in this offering and the concurrent private placements and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment.
Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements, and you will be relying on their judgment in applying these proceeds. Our management might not apply our net proceeds in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. At this time, we have not identified specific uses for the proceeds. However, we currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of these net proceeds. You will not have

the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements.
After the completion of this offering and the concurrent private placements, we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.
After the completion of this offering and the concurrent private placements, we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.

USE OF PROCEEDS
We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements of approximately $210.1 million ($231.3 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full) based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of approximately $6.1 million. The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, create a public market for our common stock, and facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use the additional capital obtained from this offering and the concurrent private placements for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, which may include domestic and international development activities, hiring additional personnel and investing in research and development. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our development activities and the amount of cash generated or used by our operations.
As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify all of the particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in this offering and the concurrent private placements. Pending specific uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from the offering and the concurrent private placements in interest-bearing, investment grade securities.
DIVIDEND POLICY
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our revolving loan contains limitations on our ability to issue dividends.

CAPITALIZATION
The following table sets forth cash and cash equivalents and our capitalization as of December 31, 2011:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
on an actual basis;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
on a pro forma basis to reflect (i) the conversion of all of our shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2011 into 30,069,900 shares of common stock upon the completion of this offering (which includes the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E preferred stock, as described below), (ii) the effectiveness of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in Delaware immediately prior to the completion of this offering and (iii) the conversion of the preferred stock warrants into common stock warrants upon the completion of this offering; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
on a pro forma as adjusted basis as of such date to give effect to the pro forma adjustments and (i) receipt and application of the net proceeds from the sale by us of 6,900,000 shares of common stock offered hereby at an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus), less approximately $3.8 million in offering expenses that have already been paid as of December 31, 2011 and (ii) sale of 3,409,090 shares of common stock to be purchased directly from us in the concurrent private placements based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus).

The following table also reflects a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our common stock to be effected prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and the resulting 1-for-3 conversion ratio adjustment applicable to our convertible preferred stock.
Our capitalization following the closing of this offering may be adjusted based upon the actual initial public offering price and other terms of the offering determined at pricing. The number of shares of our common stock actually issued upon the conversion of our outstanding shares of Series E preferred stock, which will occur immediately prior to the completion of this offering, depends in part on the actual initial public offering price of our common stock in this offering. The terms of our Series E preferred stock provide that the ratio at which each share of Series E preferred stock automatically converts into shares of our common stock in connection with a qualified IPO (for which this offering will qualify) will increase if the initial public offering price per share of common stock in the qualified IPO is below a specified minimum dollar amount, which would result in additional shares of common stock being issued upon conversion of the Series E preferred stock. In the event the actual initial public offering price is lower than $32.49 per share, the shares of Series E preferred stock will convert into a larger number of shares of common stock; if the initial public offering price is equal to the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, the Series E preferred stock would convert into 11,368,759 shares of common stock. A $1.00 decrease in the initial public offering price would increase by 541,370, and a $1.00 increase in the initial public offering price would decrease by 494,294, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E preferred stock.

DILUTION
As of December 31, 2011, our net tangible book value was approximately $51.0 million or $10.06 per share of common stock, and our pro forma net tangible book value was $247.7 million or $7.05 per share of our common stock. Pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets reduced by the amount of our total tangible liabilities and convertible preferred stock divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding, pro forma after giving effect to (i) a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our common stock to be effected prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and the resulting 1-for-3 conversion ratio adjustment applicable to our convertible preferred stock and (ii) the issuance of 30,069,900 shares of common stock upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering. After giving effect to the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us at an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus), and the adjustments set forth above, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31, 2011 would have been $457.8 million or $10.07 per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value of $3.02 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $11.93 per share to new investors.

(2)	Our basic net loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, excluding common stock subject to repurchase, and, if dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of stock options to purchase shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock (using the treasury stock method) and the conversion of our convertible preferred stock (using the if-converted method). For purposes of these calculations, potential shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of common stock as their effect is anti-dilutive since we generated a net loss in each period.
(3)	The basic and diluted net loss per share computation excludes potential shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock and exercise of options and warrants to purchase common stock as their effect would be anti-dilutive. See note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed explanation of the determination of the shares used in computing basic and diluted loss per share.
(4)	Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock has been computed to give effect to (i) a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our common stock to be effected prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and the resulting 1-for-3 conversion ratio adjustment applicable to our convertible preferred stock and (ii) the conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common stock.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this prospectus.
Overview
We are a leading solar thermal technology company that designs, develops and sells proprietary systems that produce reliable, clean energy in utility-scale electric power plants. Our systems use proprietary solar power tower technology to deliver cost-competitive renewable electricity and high-temperature steam for use in applications such as thermal enhanced oil recovery, or EOR. In implementing systems using our proprietary technology, we partner with several parties to develop utility-scale solar electric power plants. These parties include engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, contractors; boiler suppliers; turbine suppliers; and financing parties that may consist of strategic and/or financial investors.
While we primarily sell systems using our proprietary technology, we also act as the system architect for the layout and optimization of the solar field. In addition, we provide technical services related to the design, engineering and operation of our systems and may provide overall project development services. During the construction phase of a project, we may recognize revenue from the sale of our proprietary technology. For the projects where we lead development, we expect to own initially 100% of the equity in the projects, but may seek development partners on specific projects. A project’s assets are typically held by a special purpose, single member limited liability company, in which we are initially the sole member, that we refer to as a project company. We intend to ultimately transfer the majority of the equity in these project companies to third parties while retaining a minority equity interest, as we did with Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, or Ivanpah. Until the time of such transfer, we expect to wholly own each project company and consolidate its profits and losses in our financial statements. Outside of the United States, we may or may not have ownership interests in such projects using our systems.
Through our project companies, we have 13 executed and outstanding long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, to deliver approximately 2.4 GW of installed capacity to two of the largest electric utilities in the United States, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, or PG&E, and Southern California Edison, or SCE. We believe these PPAs represent one of the largest utility-scale solar pipelines in the United States and should provide us with a significant revenue opportunity between 2012 and 2016. For purposes of illustration, our agreements for the supply of equipment and services to the Ivanpah project, which has three PPAs totaling 377 MW, represent $672.0 million of contracted sales, which equates to approximately $1.8 million of contracted sales per MW. Consistent with our 14% ownership in Ivanpah, we recognize 86% of any actual sales as revenue.
In 2007, we entered the thermal EOR business after Chevron selected our technology through a competitive process. After winning the business, we signed a contract with Chevron in 2008 to provide a 29 MWth EOR facility in Coalinga, California. We commenced construction of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project in 2009, and the project began operations in October 2011.
From our inception through December 31, 2011, we have recognized $196.2 million in revenue. As of December 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of $288.2 million. We experienced net
 
46
Table of Contents

losses of $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $71.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Opportunities, Challenges and Risks
Globally, the solar industry has experienced significant growth in recent years. There has been increased demand for solar energy as costs for electricity generated from solar resources have become more competitive relative to fossil fuel generation and as a result of government incentives and mandates, such as state renewable portfolio standards, or RPS, in the United States. We expect the increasing demand for energy generated from solar and other renewable resources and changes in government regulation to be the most significant trends affecting our industry today and in the immediate future.
Although other opportunities, challenges and risks may impact our operations and financial condition, including many that we do not or cannot foresee, we believe that our results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future will be affected by several key opportunities, challenges and risks. These include our pipeline execution and business development, financing requirements and governmental programs and incentives, as described below.
Our Pipeline Execution and Business Development
We expect to generate the majority of our revenues from sales of our systems to utility-scale solar thermal power plants. The economic feasibility of these plants is materially affected by electricity market prices. PPAs are contracts that provide for the purchase of electricity at an agreed-upon price for a specified period of time. Long-term PPAs, which may be as long as 20 to 25 years for solar projects, provide a predictable revenue stream and significantly limit the impact of market price variability. We believe this type of PPA substantially enhances the ability to obtain long-term, non-recourse financing which is generally considered critical for solar projects such as ours.
Through our project companies, we have 13 executed and outstanding long-term PPAs with PG&E and SCE to deliver approximately 2.4 GW of installed capacity. We attempt to match each signed PPA with a site in our development portfolio that is consistent with and fulfills the requirements of the PPA. Depending on the size of a given site, multiple PPAs can be associated with it. For example, three of the PPAs we signed are associated with Ivanpah, and we retain 10 PPAs to deliver approximately 2.0 GW of installed capacity. In addition, we are actively working to secure additional PPAs, which we intend to match with sites in our portfolio. As part of meeting our obligations under these 10 PPAs and the additional PPAs we are pursuing, we have a robust development site portfolio currently comprised of approximately 90,000 acres of land under our control across California and the U.S. Southwest. This site portfolio has the potential to accommodate approximately 9 GW (gross) of installed capacity.
We dedicate resources to the development of each site based on the likely date by which we expect deliveries of electricity from the site to commence. Our site portfolio is frequently reviewed and could change. New sites are identified and added to the portfolio, and existing sites are re-prioritized or removed from the portfolio. The attractiveness of a particular site, and its priority of importance within our site portfolio, is driven by such things as the quality of the solar insolation at the site, availability of transmission, environmental considerations, the predicted ease of permitting the site, the size of the site, the likelihood of fatal flaws at the site, the cost of maintaining control of the site, and the probable schedule for development of the site as compared to others in the site portfolio. The cost of developing a site varies substantially, depending on such things as whether it is publicly- or privately-owned land, whether it is has previously been used for agricultural or other purposes, environmental considerations, the density of plants and animals and, in particular, the presence of endangered or threatened species on the site, and other factors that influence the permitting process.

We defer linkage of specific sites with specific PPAs, until the sites are in advanced development as described below, because we are constantly prospecting for better sites than those in our portfolio. The PPAs are generally not site specific and will be assigned to a particular site based on various considerations. We believe that the sites in our portfolio will allow us to develop projects sufficient to meet our obligations under our PPAs.
Sites which meet our specific project viability criteria are considered in “advanced development.” Once a site is in advanced development, its budget includes site acquisition costs, permitting, environmental compliance, transmission interconnection costs, preparation of project contracts, and early engineering work. The advanced development budget for any site typically is in excess of $30 million and is expected to be funded through cash balances and the net proceeds of this offering.
Risk is inherent in project development, but we follow a careful process of constant review and evaluation that manages and mitigates risks to the extent possible. Our long-term business plan and budget include appropriate funding to support development activities across our site portfolio, in order to meet our obligations under our existing PPAs and support additional opportunities. We could incur significant expenditures on a given site with which we later do not proceed.
We currently have three sites in advanced development, Rio Mesa Solar and Hidden Hills Ranch, each located in California, and Sandy Valley, located in Nevada. Rio Mesa Solar consists of approximately 5,800 acres and in October 2011, we filed an Application for Certification with the California Energy Commission (CEC) for the development of three 250 MW solar power plants. Hidden Hills Ranch consists of approximately 3,300 acres and in August 2011, we filed a similar application with the CEC for the development of two 250 MW solar power plants. Sandy Valley consists of approximately 10,000 acres. Although Sandy Valley will not require an Application for Certification because it is located in Nevada, similar permitting activity will begin in 2012.
Ivanpah, the first project that will deliver power to serve PPAs that we have signed, is comprised of three concentrating solar thermal power plants. This project is located on an approximately 3,500 acre site in California’s Mojave Desert and will have an installed capacity of 377 MW. Construction of Ivanpah began in October 2010 and operations for all three phases are scheduled to commence in 2013. As of February 2012, the three power plants at Ivanpah were 26.5%, 18.3% and 15.7% complete, respectively, and overall EPC at Ivanpah was 25.2% complete. All three Ivanpah phases have fully-committed equity and debt financing to fund construction costs, together with other project costs such as interest during construction, sales tax, mitigation and development costs, interconnection costs, cost contingencies and debt reserves.
In addition to executing on our existing pipeline of PPAs, we are focused on identifying additional opportunities to sell our systems in targeted international and domestic markets. We are partnering with Alstom on bids for projects in international markets, such as the Middle East, Northern Africa, South Africa, Southern Europe, India and Australia. For example, in March 2011, we jointly submitted a bid with Alstom in response to a tender process conducted by the State of Israel for a 110 MW solar thermal power plant near Ashalim, Israel. In September 2011, the tender committee advised us that the bid had passed the minimum threshold requirements but was provisionally rejected due to the pricing. In January 2012, the tender committee invited us to submit an updated bid at a target electricity price set by the committee. A few commercial issues are now being negotiated with the tender committee. We also intend to pursue additional opportunities for the development of large scale thermal EOR projects using our systems globally. Our Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project in California, developed in partnership with Chevron, represents our first thermal EOR project and commenced operations in October 2011. We believe that solar-to-steam applications of our systems, such as thermal EOR, represent a significant growth opportunity globally.

Financing Requirements
Development and construction of large scale solar thermal facilities is capital intensive. As a result, the ability to access capital efficiently and effectively is crucial to our growth strategy. For example, Ivanpah received a $1.6 billion loan, guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Energy, or DOE, and funded by the Federal Financing Bank, a branch of the U.S. Department of Treasury, or U.S. Treasury. In addition, Ivanpah has received a total equity commitment of $598 million, consisting of $300 million from NRG Solar, $168 million from a Google Inc. affiliate and $130 million from us. While Ivanpah has fully committed financing, executing on our pipeline and expanding our business requires significant additional capital. Once Ivanpah and the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project are operational, we expect to be able to access the traditional project finance and capital markets to both develop and construct future projects.
Governmental Programs and Incentives
U.S. Renewable Portfolio Standards:    Among the more significant factors driving growth in our business in the United States are state-mandated RPS. We expect to continue to benefit from the increasing demand for renewable energy as a result of favorable legislation adopted by over half of the states, including our initial target markets in California and the U.S. Southwest. In each of these states, relevant legislation currently requires an increasing percentage of the electricity supplied by electric utility companies operating in such states be derived from renewable energy resources until certain pre-established goals are met. We expect that the additional demand for renewable energy from utilities in such states will create additional opportunities for us to expand our business.
U.S. Federal Tax and Economic Incentives:    We utilize U.S. federal government programs supporting renewable energy, which enhance the economic feasibility of developing our projects. The key federal programs include ITCs, cash grants in lieu of ITCs and loan guarantees under the ARRA, and accelerated depreciation of renewable energy property. In April 2011, we closed the $1.6 billion construction and term loan facility guaranteed by the DOE to help finance construction of Ivanpah. Ivanpah also qualifies for cash grants in lieu of ITCs in the aggregate amount of approximately $570 million, which are expected to be paid within 60 days after each project is placed in service. We may apply for additional federal loan guarantees and cash grants for future projects if they remain available; however, our financing strategy for future projects does not contemplate the use of federal loan guarantees or cash grants.
International Government Incentives:    Outside of the United States, we expect that a variety of governmental initiatives and the adoption of programs designed to encourage clean renewable and sustainable energy sources at the national, provincial and local levels will create new opportunities for the development of new solar projects.
Basis of Presentation
The following describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations:
Revenues
We primarily sell systems using our technology to utility-scale solar thermal power projects or to oil and gas production companies pursuing thermal EOR activities. We also generate revenue from technical services provided to the long-term owners of projects using our systems. In addition to selling systems to project companies, we also expect to generate revenue through system sales to and licensing arrangements with development partners, particularly in key markets outside of the United States.
 
49
Table of Contents

We generally recognize revenue over the development and construction periods of the projects to which we sell, which typically extend over multiple years, using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, estimated contract revenue is accrued based on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs. Anticipated contract losses are estimated and recognized in full in the period in which the loss becomes evident. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed at least quarterly and revised periodically as the work progresses and adjustments to estimated contract revenue and total cost estimates are reflected in the period when such estimates are revised. These estimates require significant management judgment because the underlying assumptions are subject to change as the projects progress and better information becomes available. Actual results may vary substantially from management’s estimates.
Revenues may be deferred, either in part or in whole, dependent on our ability to estimate costs, which may be impacted by our post-delivery obligations or guarantees such as installation, customer acceptance or performance guarantees. Our continued investment and other potential forms of continuing involvement in these projects may restrict the amounts that we are able to recognize as revenue.
Our sales are typically to project companies that have been formed to facilitate our project development and construction activities. Depending upon our ownership interest, degree of control and influence over the project companies, we may consolidate these entities, and therefore will not recognize any revenue associated with the sales of our systems or services. For those project companies that are not consolidated, we will recognize revenues associated with the sales of our systems and provision of services, subject to our continuing ownership percentages. For example, if we retain a 10% ownership interest in a project company, we will generally only recognize 90% of the profit from our sales to that project company. See our discussion of critical accounting policies below and in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our policies for consolidation and deconsolidation of project companies.
We anticipate that we will transfer ownership interests in the project companies, accept additional investors, contribute the assets of the project companies to a joint venture or otherwise experience a change in the degree of control we are able to exercise. When this occurs, we must evaluate the facts and circumstances of each project to determine whether we should continue to consolidate the operations of the project companies. When appropriate, we will deconsolidate a project company that had been previously consolidated and will only then recognize revenue from sales to that entity, subject to the conditions discussed above. Revenue from our sales to an unconsolidated project company may be limited by our continued investment in that entity, and so revenues that are recognized in our financial statements may be less than the total sales to these project companies.
The transfers of our interests in project companies, sale of equity interests or contributions to joint ventures, in which we will have typically gained control of land or land rights, are evaluated based on the stage of development of the project and the composition of the assets within the project prior to sale or contribution. We evaluate the composition and fair value of assets sold or contributed within the project companies at the date of the transaction to determine whether a significant amount of the fair value is real estate or non-real estate assets. If the stage of development or fair value of the underlying assets results in the determination that the underlying assets are real estate in nature, we will carry the full value of the asset under construction on our books and would not record revenue until such time as the project was delivered and the earnings process complete. Transfers of project interests or contributions to joint ventures are generally not deemed revenue, with gains or losses from these transactions normally recorded in “Loss on deconsolidation of consolidated subsidiary” in our consolidated statements of operations. See “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for further information regarding our consolidation and revenue recognition policies.

Table of Contents

Through December 31, 2011, our revenues have been primarily associated with two projects, Ivanpah and the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project.
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Ivanpah:    Prior to April 2011, substantially all of our revenue associated with Ivanpah was derived from sales of development services to Solar Partners II, LLC, or SPII, one of the project companies formed to facilitate the development of Ivanpah. From March 2007 to October 2009, we were an investor in this project company but did not consolidate the entity as we were not considered the primary beneficiary. Therefore, revenue relating to services provided to this entity was recognized as the services were delivered through October 2009. After October 2009, as a result of our acquisition of additional interests in SPII, this entity was consolidated and all subsequent activity, which had previously been reported as revenue, was eliminated in consolidation. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, construction of Ivanpah commenced. In April 2011, we contributed all of the project companies associated with Ivanpah, including SPII to a new entity, Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC, or Ivanpah HoldCo, contributed additional assets and accepted new investors into that entity to complete the financing for the Ivanpah project. Following the investment by third-party investors, we are no longer the primary beneficiary of Ivanpah HoldCo or the Ivanpah project companies and, accordingly, have deconsolidated Ivanpah HoldCo.

All revenue from the Ivanpah project subsequent to October 2009 has been associated with our fixed-price solar field supply and related services contracts. We recognize revenue on these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Consistent with our 14% ownership interest in the Ivanpah project, we recognize 86% of the profit margin with respect to our sales to the project only at the time that we are able to make reasonable estimates.
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project:    All revenue from the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project located in Coalinga, California has been associated with solar field supply sales and services. The current contract value including change orders is $27.8 million, of which nearly 100% has been recognized through December 31, 2011. We have recognized revenue on this contract using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, with revenue measured as the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the contract. The project began operations in October 2011. This fixed price contract for the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project was entered into at a loss. We entered into this loss contract for the purposes of providing a commercially scaled demonstration of our technologies, establishing our technology as a viable solution for the enhanced oil recovery market, validating our heliostat manufacturing processes at volume, testing our supply chain and logistics, and isolating any previously unidentified design or other issues inherent in the construction of a solar field.

In December 2008, upon execution of the commercial agreement to construct the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project, we recognized a provision for estimated contract losses representing $10.5 million. At that time, the estimate of the contract loss was considered reliable and, as such, the appropriate revenue recognition was deemed to be the percentage-of-completion method. As of December 31, 2011, we have recognized a cumulative provision for loss representing the entire anticipated loss since inception of $67.3 million, or $56.8 million greater than the initial loss estimate as recognized in December 2008. Discrete events transpired during the periods subsequent to when the initial loss estimate was made, through December 31, 2011, that required adjustments to the original estimated costs to complete the project. These items included non-recoverable customer driven design changes, increased vendor and material costs due to scope and design changes, increased mechanical and electrical costs associated with design and engineering changes, delays and subsequent costs to remobilize and accelerate construction as the result of abnormal weather patterns, and increased costs associated with efforts to accelerate the scheduled completion of the facility.

Table of Contents

During the first half of 2011, we experienced substantial increases in our estimated cost to complete due to additional costs being identified that were primarily associated with design specification errors provided by one of our third-party design engineering subcontractors. As we neared the final stages of the construction process, we identified design issues that led to our replacing this design engineering subcontractor. A subsequent detailed review resulted in modification of certain engineering designs associated with the solar tower systems. This change resulted in significant delay and substantial rework. This also resulted in our other construction and electrical subcontractors incurring substantial cost which we do not anticipate being able to recover. The project began operations in October 2011.
As part of the original contract, we agreed to provide ongoing operations and maintenance for the project through the first year of operations. In the third quarter of 2011, we determined that the estimated costs of providing these operations and maintenance services exceeded the expected revenues and as a result, we recognized an additional provision for loss on contract in the amount of $2.4 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized $6.3 million of warranty expense following the identification of two specific design or component failures for which we are liable under our warranty provisions. Until satisfaction of the twelve-month performance test and completion of the warranty period, our costs may increase and accordingly, we may incur additional provisions for loss on contract.
We do not intend to act as EPC contractor on Ivanpah or future projects as construction and construction management are not our core competencies. Highly skilled and competent EPC contractors, which possess the necessary expertise to effectively fulfill the EPC function, are available and are better qualified to execute the EPC function. For example, Bechtel is acting as the EPC contractor for Ivanpah under a fixed-price contract with our role limited to supplying our proprietary solar field materials and technology and providing engineering and other technical services. We believe that this approach reduces the potential for cost overruns, making our projects more attractive to investors, as the EPC contractor will have sole responsibility for cost overruns with respect to the EPC function. We also believe this approach will facilitate making our liquidity and capital resources needs more predictable.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit (Loss)
Cost of revenues includes cost of materials, labor costs, overhead, amortized tooling costs, shipping and logistics costs, engineering support, testing, and reserves for estimated warranty costs and reserves for performance guarantees and provisions for loss on construction contracts (as discussed above). Cost of revenues vary significantly between periods depending on the level of billable development activity and changes in our percentage of ownership in a particular project. The applicable Ivanpah project contracts and the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project contract are accounted for under construction accounting. If the estimated total costs to complete our scope of supply under a construction accounting contract are in excess of the contract value, the contract is considered a “loss contract”, as is the case for the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project. As a loss contract, any changes in the underlying estimates which increase the expected loss are recognized in the period in which the change becomes evident.
We anticipate a significant increase in engineering, procurement, quality assurance and other costs associated with our cost of revenue as we source and deliver our solar technologies and services into Ivanpah and future projects.
We define our gross profit (loss) as our total revenues less our total cost of revenues, and our gross margin as our gross profit (loss) expressed as a percentage of total revenue.

Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses include research and development, project development, marketing, general and administrative, and loss on deconsolidation of consolidated subsidiary expenses. Operating expenses are subject to substantial fluctuation between periods depending on the status of projects under development. As projects meet our criteria for project capitalization, project development costs that were expensed in prior periods will be prospectively capitalized, and our operating expenses in such future periods will be reduced by the amount of the costs that we capitalize. Costs which were expensed in preceding periods are not capitalized. The criteria for project capitalization include control of the underlying properties, a determination that the site can be developed as planned and the linking of an off-take agreement, such as a PPA, to a site or other viable economic justification for constructing the project. Upon achieving these milestones, we capitalize on a prospective basis all costs of design, development, construction and other costs directly associated with the development of the projects. We do not typically capitalize research and development or marketing, general and administrative costs; however, costs that are directly linked to development of the project, such as legal and regulatory costs associated with the project or personnel assigned to support project specific development activities, may be capitalized if deemed eligible. If it should be determined that a project is no longer viable, any costs that had been previously capitalized would be immediately expensed in the period the determination is made.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, prototyping expense, contract and professional services, and amortized equipment expense. Research and development expenses also include the costs of operating our Solar Energy Development Center, or SEDC, in Israel. We expense research and development costs as incurred.
We consider continued research and development key to our business and devote considerable effort and resources to enhance the efficiency, reliability and capacity factor of our solar thermal technology to maintain our competitive advantage over alternative technologies. Subsequent to the completion of our SEDC facility and the transition of Ivanpah from a development activity into design and construction, our expenditures in research and development have decreased significantly. However, we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in terms of dollar amounts and will decline as a percentage of revenue.
Project Development
Project development expenses consist primarily of land options, land leases, transmission access and integration costs, project engineering, third-party engineering studies, environmental costs, legal, regulatory, and consulting fees, and other direct costs associated with identification and development of suitable sites for our solar thermal power facilities. Also included are personnel costs for our teams in site acquisition, transmission, environmental, regulatory and project engineering. We expense all costs associated with our project development activities until such time as we achieve our project viability criteria. If a project is abandoned or deemed to be no longer viable, all capitalized costs are expensed in the period the abandonment occurs. Depending upon the timing of when a project becomes subject to capitalization, or if a project previously subject to capitalization is abandoned, there may be significant differences in project development expense between periods.
We consider our project development activities integral to our effort to grow the market for our technologies and will continue to expend significant effort and expense to grow our portfolio of projects. We expect that project development will increase in terms of dollar amounts but will decline as a percentage of revenue as a result of increased product sales.

Table of Contents

Marketing, General and Administrative
Marketing, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our marketing, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions, as well as fees for professional and contract services. We expense marketing, general and administrative costs as incurred.
As our business has grown, we have increased our expenditures on marketing, general and administrative functions necessary to support this growth. Following the offering, we will incur additional marketing, general and administrative expenses related to operating as a public company, such as increased legal and accounting expenses, the cost of an investor relations function, costs related to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and increased director and officer insurance premiums. We expect marketing, general and administrative services will continue to increase in terms of dollar amounts but will decline as a percentage of revenue as we continue to grow and expand our operations, increase our marketing team to handle our expanding business activity, expand into international markets and transition to becoming a public company.
Loss on Deconsolidation of Consolidated Subsidiary
Loss on deconsolidation of consolidated subsidiary represents the difference between the value of assets received, at fair value, the fair value of any retained interest, and the historic cost of the assets deconsolidated. In cases where we transfer control of the entity but retain an investment in the entity, we will generally recognize any resulting gain or loss from deconsolidation as an operating expense.
Interest (Expense)
Interest (expense) consists of interest paid on short- and long-term borrowings and the amortization of loan issuance costs. We expect interest expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our operations to the extent we utilize debt financing to fund this expansion. We anticipate that interest directly associated with the financing of construction on projects in which we are an investor will not be reflected in our financial statements as interest expense but rather will be capitalized to the project companies to the extent they qualify.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of transaction gains and losses on our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, interest income on our cash and short-term investments, and the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability. We have historically invested our available cash balances in money market funds and short-term U.S. Treasury obligations. Our primary foreign currencies are the euro and the Israeli shekel. We expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates.
Provision for Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed using the assets and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We believe, based on the available information, it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized, and, accordingly, we have taken a full valuation allowance against all of our
 
54
Table of Contents

United States and Israeli deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $102.3 million of federal, $95.8 million of California and $35.0 million of foreign net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2027 for federal, 2017 for state if unused, but do not expire for international purposes.
Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forward in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Our existing net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in connection with or after this offering, our ability to utilize NOLs and tax credits could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are beyond our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of any companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs or tax credits reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2011
Revenue
Revenues increased $145.6 million, or 1,079%, from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $159.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $154.0 million increase in revenues associated with the Ivanpah solar field supply and services contracts beginning in April 2011 with no comparable contracts in the previous year. Prior to April 5, 2011, we were the sole owner of the Ivanpah project and, as such, intercompany sales were eliminated. We recognize approximately 86% of the revenues generated from the supply and service contracts to Ivanpah HoldCo subsequent to the Ivanpah transaction closing in April 2011 using the percentage-of-completion method. We will continue to recognize approximately 86% of the
 
55
Table of Contents

revenues associated with the supply and services contracts to Ivanpah HoldCo until such time as our ownership interest changes or the project is complete, which is currently anticipated to be in late 2012. Under the percentage-of-completion method, increases in the estimated cost to complete the project may have an adverse impact on revenue recognition for that period. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a $8.8 million decrease in revenues from the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project. The decrease in revenues from the prior year was primarily driven by the decrease in construction related activities for the project as it neared completion. We turned over operations of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project to Chevron in October 2011. As a result, we do not expect future revenues relating to the construction of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Loss
Cost of revenues increased $123.7 million, or 393%, from $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $113.2 million increase in cost of revenues for the Ivanpah solar field and supply contracts and $1.8 million in estimated warranty expense, which represents our best estimate of future warranty costs relating to our standard solar thermal supply sales. The increase in the cost of revenues for the Ivanpah solar field and supply contracts was primarily due to the change in our ownership interest in Ivanpah HoldCo in April 2011, which changed the nature of our relationship in Ivanpah HoldCo from owner to supplier.
In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2011, our estimated cost to complete the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project was $22.5 million, or $4.6 million greater than the amounts recognized in 2010. The increase in estimated cost to complete the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to changes in design associated with a change in the project engineering firm and redesign of certain elements of the tower design. As a result of the redesign, we experienced a number of unanticipated engineering change orders, which resulted in substantial costs associated with the removal, rework and replacement of previously installed structures and equipment, as well as associated premium time to maintain the construction schedule. In October 2011, the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project commenced operations.
As part of the original agreement, we agreed to provide operating and maintenance services (O&M) for the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project through the first year of operations. In the third quarter of 2011, after the delivery of the project, we determined that the estimated costs to provide these services exceeded the expected revenues. As a result, we recognized an additional provision for loss on contract of approximately $2.4 million, which represents the estimated loss over the O&M contract period. Changes in the estimated costs to provide O&M services may result in additional provisions for loss on contract through the service period. In addition, in 2011, we recognized approximately $6.3 million in warranty expense related to the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project as a result of our identification of two specific design or component failures for which we are liable under our warranty provisions, net of expected vendor recoveries. As a result of the need to remediate the design and component failures, the O&M service period was extended to eighteen months. This extension did not result in a significant increase in our estimated O&M costs. Future increases in our estimated costs to fulfill our warranty obligations, as discussed above, could negatively impact our results of operations.
Also in 2011, we determined that some of our manufacturing and production equipment formerly used for the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project was impaired. As a result, we recognized a loss on impairment of approximately $2.0 million. The fair values of the assets as of the disposal date were $0 due to the fact that the assets were determined to be obsolete.
Gross loss decreased from $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to a gross profit of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Gross margins were (133)% for the year ended

Table of Contents

December 31, 2010 and 2.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Gross loss decreased and gross margins increased primarily due to the increase in the revenues related to the Ivanpah solar field supply and services contracts.
Research and Development
Research and development costs increased $9.0 million, or 106%, from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 due primarily to an increase in salaries and related expenses of $5.9 million, from $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Headcount associated with research and development activities increased to 163 at December 31, 2011, from 128 at December 31, 2010. The increase in research and development activities in 2011 is primarily due to our SolarPLUS storage technology as well as our ongoing efforts to improve our technology and reduce project costs. Allocations of engineering support costs, not related to research and development, to projects and cost of revenues increased $1.4 million, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Project Development
Project development costs increased $7.8 million, or 42%, from $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in 2011 is due primarily to an increase in direct and indirect costs of project development of $8.8 million and an increase in salaries and related expense of $5.2 million. These increases are primarily due to the fact that we have increased our site development activity in 2011 as compared to 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we have three sites in advance development whereas in 2010 our activities were primarily focused on the Ivanpah project. These increases were partially offset by an increase in allocations to capitalized project costs of $6.7 million for those projects which achieved our capitalization criteria and a decrease of $0.7 million in consulting fees and professional services.
Marketing, General and Administrative
Marketing, general and administrative costs increased $13.1 million, or 54%, from $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 due primarily to increased compensation related expense of $7.6 million and increased consulting and other administrative costs of $3.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees of $1.3 million and an increase of $3.8 million in allocations to capitalized project costs in 2011 as compared to 2010. Headcount associated with marketing, general and administrative increased to 141 at December 31, 2011, from 107 at December 31, 2010 in preparation for operations as a public company and increased business activities.
Loss on Deconsolidation of Consolidated Subsidiary
Loss on deconsolidation of consolidated subsidiary costs increased from nil for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to the Ivanpah transaction. In April 2011, we contributed the Ivanpah Group and $30.5 million of additional assets to a newly formed holding company, Ivanpah HoldCo. Two additional investors contributed $416.0 million in return for an economic interest in Ivanpah HoldCo of 86%. This contribution was in the form of $116.8 million in cash and future commitments to fund an additional $299.2 million. As a result of this transaction, the assets of the Ivanpah Group were deconsolidated from our balance sheet, and we realized a loss of $77.7 million from the divestiture of an 86% economic interest in the Ivanpah HoldCo net assets. This loss was partially offset by a gain of $54.9 million related to the increase in fair value of the 14% retained noncontrolling economic interest in Ivanpah HoldCo as a result of the deconsolidation. For further information on this transaction, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.

Interest (Expense)
Interest expense increased $7.9 million, or 395%, from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is primarily related to interest cost and amortization of loan charges on our $75.0 million credit facility entered into in October 2010 and repaid in April 2011, the Hercules loans, and the $20.0 million loan entered into with BDC Ivanpah, LLC, or BDC Ivanpah, in April 2011. BDC Ivanpah is controlled by the Bechtel Group, Inc.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2010
Revenue
Revenues increased $1.9 million, or 17%, from $11.6 million in 2009 to $13.5 million in 2010. The increase was due to increased construction revenues of $5.3 million related to the development of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project, offset by a decrease in services revenues of $3.4 million in 2010 as a result of our consolidation of Solar Partners II, the project company for the first phase of Ivanpah. Revenues associated with Solar Partners II was eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Loss
Cost of revenues increased $12.5 million, or 65%, from $19.0 million in 2009 to $31.5 million in 2010. The increase was due in part to $5.3 million of additional costs for equipment, materials, engineering and other construction related costs and $10.4 million in increases in our estimated costs to complete our ongoing Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project, which was partially offset by a $3.4 million reduction in costs caused by the Ivanpah Reconsolidation. Gross loss increased from $7.4 million in 2009 to $18.0 million in 2010. Gross margins were (133)% in 2010 and (64)% in 2009. Gross loss and gross margins declined due to a greater increase in costs than in revenues associated with the development of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project. We do not anticipate entering into another loss contract similar to the Chevron agreement, and therefore expect future gross margins to increase.
Research and Development
Research and development costs decreased $1.1 million, or 12%, from $9.7 million in 2009 to $8.6 million in 2010 due to a transition from research and development activities to activities associated with cost of revenues and as a result of capitalizing expenses associated with developing Ivanpah. Allocations to projects and cost of revenues increased to $4.5 million in 2010 from $1.0 million in 2009, an increase of $3.5 million, which was offset by an increase in 2010 payroll costs of $2.2 million. Headcount associated with research and development activities increased to 128 at December 31, 2010 from 79 at December 31, 2009.
Project Development
Project development costs increased $5.8 million, or 47%, to $18.2 million from $12.4 million in 2009 due primarily to an increase in direct and indirect costs of project development of $10.5 million, increased salaries and related expense of $4.1 million and an increase of $1.2 million in consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by allocations to capitalized project costs in the amount of $11.3 million.
Marketing, General and Administrative
Marketing, general and administrative costs increased $10.1 million, or 71%, to $24.4 million in 2010 from $14.3 million in 2009 due to increased legal and consulting fees of $10.8 million, increased

compensation related expense of $3.2 million and increased other administrative costs of $2.3 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $6.4 million in capitalized project costs to $7.6 million in 2010 from $1.2 million in 2009. Headcount associated with marketing, general and administrative increased to 98 at December 31, 2010 from 59 at December 31, 2009.
Interest (Expense)
Interest (expense) increased $1.8 million from $0.2 million in 2009 to $2.0 million in 2010 related to interest and other charges on a $75.0 million credit facility entered into in October 2010, interest related to the Hercules term loan entered into in December 2010 and long-term debt associated with project development.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $206.5 million that were primarily held or invested in demand deposit accounts and money market funds. Our primary source of cash historically has been proceeds from the sales of convertible preferred stock, short-term borrowings and sales of solar thermal systems and services. Through December 31, 2011, we had raised $506.8 million, net of issuance costs and placement fees, from the issuance of convertible preferred stock. As of December 31, 2011, we had $45.0 million of outstanding debt. Since inception through the year ended December 31, 2011, we had accumulated net operating losses of $288.2 million.
As of December 31, 2011, our subsidiaries in Israel held approximately $129.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Currently, there are no general restrictions on the transfer of these funds from our foreign subsidiaries to BrightSource Energy, Inc., the parent. To the extent transfers from Israel are deemed dividends on earnings or repayment of interest on intercompany loans, we are subject to withholding for Israeli taxes.
We are required to maintain cash balances that are restricted or pledged for various security provisions associated with certain commercial agreements (e.g., equipment purchases, service contracts, operating leases, performance guarantees, power purchase agreements and project development security). As such, we have pledged cash in support of letters of credit, escrow agreements and control agreements with respect to future payments and deposit obligations. The classification of the amounts are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as current or long-term are based on the timing of when the cash will be contractually released.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and our share of project equity needs for at least the next 12 months.
Capital Expenditures
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we used $17.7 million, $92.5 million, and $107.9 million in cash, respectively, to fund capital expenditures, primarily related to continued investments in capitalized project costs associated with Ivanpah, Rio Mesa Solar, and Hidden Hills Ranch.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2011
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(64.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily related to payments received for our solar thermal technology supply and services contracts, offset partially by cash paid to our suppliers and employees as a result of spending across all functions for construction of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project, sourcing, engineering services and manufacture of Ivanpah scope of supply, and payments for deposits. Operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2011 also included $21.0 million of non-recurring cash flows related to the application of deposits made prior to the lvanpah transaction.
We have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations. As we continue to expand our business and build our infrastructure both in the United States and internationally, we may continue to experience negative cash flows from operations. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development, project development and marketing, and general and administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support sales growth, including cash deposits to suppliers, and to support performance obligations, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. Lastly, our operating cash flows are also affected by the timing of billings on uncompleted contracts to customers compared to when the related costs are incurred as well as the timing of release from restriction of cash received directly from customers that is immediately restricted for use in our operations.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $191.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $43.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Cash usage during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily related to purchases of property, plant and equipment of $20.3 million, payments of $42.4 million for deposits, and payments for capitalized project costs of $87.5 million, offset partially by $105.5 million we received in a cash distribution from the Ivanpah transaction.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $274.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $127.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 included net proceeds of $170.9 million from our Series E preferred stock financings, $16.7 million of borrowings under our term loan, $25.0 million of borrowings from our revolving loan, and $20.0 million of borrowings under our BDC Ivanpah loan, offset by a $75.0 million repayment of our credit facility and a $25 million repayment of our term loan.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2010
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $64.1 million in 2010 compared to $51.5 million in 2009. Cash usage during 2010 was primarily related to cash paid to our suppliers and employees as a result of spending across all functions due to the construction of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project and commencement of construction of Ivanpah.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $191.3 million in 2010 compared to $30.7 million in 2009. Cash usage during 2010 was primarily related to purchases of equipment of $9.2 million, payments for deposits of $36.9 million, capitalized project costs of $83.2 million and increases in restricted cash of $61.9 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $274.4 million in 2010 compared to net cash used of $1.6 million in 2009. Financing activities in 2010 included proceeds of $162.8 million from our Series D and E preferred stock financings, $20.6 million from the issuance of common stock in association with our Series D preferred stock financing, $15.5 million from convertible note payable, of which we repaid $2.6 million and the remaining outstanding amount was converted to Series D preferred stock, $75.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility and $8.3 million of borrowings under our term loan.
Debt Obligations
Credit Facility
On October 4, 2010, we entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, and others of our subsidiaries which may in the future be designated as borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Citicorp North America, Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch. The Credit Agreement provided us with a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate available amount of $75.0 million. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we also entered into a pledge and security agreement with each of the other grantors and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as collateral agent.
At December 31, 2010, we had drawn $75.0 million, which included $4.1 million in prepaid interest and $2.1 million in debt issuance costs. As of December 31, 2010, based on applicable indices, the weighted-average borrowing rate under the credit agreement was 7.4%.
In connection with the closing of Ivanpah financing in April 2011, the borrowings under this Credit Agreement were repaid in-full and the Credit Agreement was terminated.
Term Loan
On December 28, 2010, we entered into a Loan and Guaranty Agreement, or the Initial Hercules Loan Agreement, with certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., and Hercules Technology II, L.P., or collectively, the Initial Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide us with a term loan in the amount of $25.0 million, which we refer to as the Hercules Term Loan. In connection with the Hercules Term Loan Agreement, we also entered into a pledge and security agreement dated December 28, 2010 among us, each of the guarantors under the Hercules Loan Agreement and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., as collateral agent, and associated security or deposit control agreements.

Table of Contents

The Hercules Term Loan consisted of a Term Loan A and Term Loan B. The Term Loan A was for the principal amount of $11.2 million, and Term Loan B was for the principal amount of $13.8 million, for an aggregate amount of $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, we had drawn $8.3 million of the $25.0 million Hercules Term Loan, and drew the remaining $16.7 million balance in January 2011. The borrowing rates under the Initial Hercules Loan Agreement were 11.0% for Term Loan A and 12.8% for Term Loan B, in 2010 and 2011, based on applicable indices.
As additional consideration for providing the Hercules Term Loan, we provided the Lenders with a warrant that, as amended, entitles them to a number of shares of our Series D preferred stock equal to the quotient derived by dividing $875,000 by the Exercise Price. The “Exercise Price” is equal to the lower of (a) $6.7246 per share if such warrant is exercised for shares of Series D preferred stock or (b) the price per share paid in the next institutional equity financing prior to an initial public offering. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, based on the Series D convertible stock price, we calculated the warrant would be exercisable for 130,119 shares of Series D preferred stock.
On October 7, 2011, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Hercules Revolving Loan Agreement, with certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. and Hercules Technology III, L.P., or collectively, the Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide us with a revolving loan in the amount of up to $35.0 million, which we refer to as the Hercules Revolving Loan. We drew down $25.0 million at the closing of the Hercules Revolving Loan Agreement to pay off the Hercules Term Loan in full. On March 20, 2012, we amended the Hercules Revolving Loan to allow us to borrow up to an additional $10.0 million either prior to or after the closing of an initial public offering which results in aggregate proceeds of at least $100.0 million, or Qualified IPO. The Hercules Revolving Loan matures on November 1, 2012.
The Hercules Revolving Loan bears interest at a floating rate of the greater of (a) prime plus 7.25% and (b) 10.5%, but all advances after the completion of a Qualified IPO will bear interest at a floating rate of the greater of (a) prime plus 5.75% and (b) 9%. If we do not complete a Qualified IPO by March 30, 2012, the Hercules Lenders can elect to receive (a) $750,000 or (b) a warrant to purchase 48,088 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $25.9938 per share or 144,265 shares of our Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $8.6646 per share.
BrightSource Construction Management, Inc., BrightSource Asset Holdings, LLC and each of our domestic subsidiaries formed after the date of the Hercules Revolving Loan Agreement (other than certain inactive subsidiaries) are required to be a guarantor under the Hercules Revolving Loan Agreement. In addition, we have pledged all of our equity interests in each of our subsidiaries as collateral for the Hercules Revolving Loan (except that our pledge of equity interests in non-U.S. entities is limited to 66% of such equity interests), and each future guarantor, if any, will be required to execute a similar pledge agreement. We and the existing guarantors have pledged certain of our and their intellectual property and other assets including among other things, receivables, equipment, fixtures, general intangibles, inventory, investment property, deposit accounts, and cash in favor of Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., as collateral agent, and we and BrightSource Construction Management, Inc. have entered into security or deposit control agreements with the collateral agent.
The Hercules Revolving Loan Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants which we must comply with, including without limitation a minimum liquidity covenant, limitations on indebtedness and limitations on dividends and other restricted payments. The Hercules Term Loan contained substantially similar covenants. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, we were, and we are currently, in compliance with these covenants.

BDC Ivanpah Loan
In April 2011, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with BDC Ivanpah for $20.0 million. The loan matures on April 8, 2016 and is subject to mandatory prepayments in the event that our loan coverage ratio falls below 2.25:1. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the loan coverage ratio and, as such, are not subject to any mandatory prepayments. The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 on the BDC Ivanpah loan was 16.5%.
CMB Loan
On November 21, 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary BrightSource Ivanpah Fundings, LLC, or Fundings, entered into a Loan Agreement with CMB Infrastructure Investment Group VII, LP, or CMB, pursuant to which CMB agreed to provide Fundings with a term loan of up to $90 million, which we refer to as the CMB Loan. We have provided a parent guaranty for Fundings’ obligations under the CMB Loan, and Fundings has given a security interest to CMB in all of Fundings’ cash flow from the Ivanpah project.
The CMB Loan is funded by individuals seeking permanent resident status in the United States through the “EB-5” visa program. Under this program, foreign persons making qualified investments that create jobs in the United States can obtain permanent residency.
The CMB Loan will be funded when the initial phase of the EB-5 application process is complete, which is expected to occur between April and September 2012. The initial advance on the CMB Loan will be used to repay in full the BDC Ivanpah loan, with the remaining proceeds being used by us. The CMB Loan bears interest at 5% annually, and quarterly interest payments are due until maturity, which is six years from the initial funding date. Due in part to the requirements of the EB-5 program, Fundings’ ability to prepay the loan is generally restricted for forty-two months after the initial funding date.
An escrow account supports the CMB Loan, and any cash flow from the Ivanpah project (including the proceeds of any tax equity financing of our interest in the Ivanpah project) will be deposited into the escrow account and held until the loan is repaid, or used to make interest payments or prepayments of principal. We are required to deposit $5 million into the escrow account on or before December 31 of each of 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, plus we are required to deposit into the escrow account the amount of any tax benefits we use from the Ivanpah project.

Table of Contents

(2)	On January 23, 2012, we entered into two master services contracts for engineering and home office services related to our Hidden Hills Ranch and Rio Mesa Solar projects. The master services contracts provide for total payments of approximately $168.0 million for these services, for the two projects, which will be payable pursuant to a fixed progress payment schedule of approximately $28.4 million in 2012, $84.9 million in 2013, $41.0 million in 2014, $11.1 million in 2015 and $2.6 million in 2016. These payments may be subject to holdbacks by us deemed necessary to ensure performance under the agreement. Additionally, we may suspend or terminate the contracts at our sole discretion upon written notice.
Obligations include significant agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and where the significant terms are specified. Where a minimum purchase obligation is stipulated, as in the case of certain supply agreements, the amounts included in the table reflect the minimum purchase amounts. Purchase obligations that are cancellable without significant penalty are not included in the table.
Post-Ivanpah Closing Contractual Obligations
Following the closing of Ivanpah on April 5, 2011, we agreed to guarantee and support certain contractual obligations of our subsidiaries and the Ivanpah project, including the following:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Solar Field Guarantees:    We have guaranteed the obligations of our subsidiaries, BrightSource Construction Management, Inc., or BSCM, and BrightSource Operations (Israel), Ltd., or BSOI, under the solar field agreements and solar field supply contracts pursuant to which we are providing equipment, technology and services to Ivanpah. Under these contracts, BSCM and BSOI are obligated to fund an escrow account to support potential delivery and performance damages. The account will be funded with a total of $108.6 million over the first year of construction following the closing by diverting a portion of payments to BSCM and BSOI under the solar field agreements and solar field supply contracts to that escrow. We have guaranteed that the account will be funded in accordance with the schedule, and if the payments diverted from BSCM and BSOI are less than projected, we are permitted to use up to $50.0 million of our common stock based on the then current fair market value (subject to a maximum of 2,454,590 shares) to bridge funding gaps if we should so elect. Assuming construction proceeds on schedule, approximately 30% of the escrow will be released upon substantial completion of Ivanpah (i.e., the amount reserved to cover potential delay damages). The remainder will be released if other potential BSCM payments under the solar field agreements (i.e., system performance and warranty obligations) are either not payable because there are no claims or, if there are claims, BSCM or we pay them directly. We would expect to know whether these additional funds will be released by completion of the ramp-up period for Ivanpah, which occurs over the first three years of operations of each of the three project phases.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Cost Overrun Funding:    To the extent Ivanpah’s costs exceed an amount equal to the base equity contribution obligations of the Ivanpah equity owners, we and the other equity owners have agreed to fund a 3% overrun contingency, known as the funded overrun equity, on a pro-rata basis. If the funded overrun equity is insufficient to cover the cost overruns for the completion of Ivanpah, we must fund all further cost overruns until Ivanpah’s construction is completed except to the extent the risk of such construction costs are borne by the contractors under fixed-price contracts. In 2011, we funded approximately $1.9 million towards this overrun contingency reserve.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Treasury Cash Grant and ITC Indemnity Obligations:    We have guaranteed certain indemnity obligations in the event the Treasury Cash Grant is recaptured by the IRS, which can occur if certain prohibited ownership transfers are made or if we were to claim investment tax credits in violation of the loan and funding agreements. Also, if the Treasury Cash Grant is significantly lower than expected such that the DOE’s “debt service reserve” of approximately

 
64
Table of Contents

 	
$57 million were to not be funded, as expected, by the Treasury Cash Grant, we would be required to fund this debt service reserve with our own cash. We are permitted to use up to $32.7 million of our common stock (subject to a maximum of 1,605,793 shares) to bridge funding gaps if we should so elect.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Sponsor Support:    Pursuant to a sponsor support agreement, we have agreed to cause BSCM, BSOI and BSII to maintain at all times sufficient capital to fulfill all of their respective obligations under the various project agreements, including schedule and performance warranties, performance obligations, escrow obligations and solvency requirements.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Bechtel Deferred Payment Guaranty:    Pursuant to a deferred payment guaranty with Bechtel, we are guaranteeing a payment of approximately $10 million that Bechtel has agreed to defer until payment of the Treasury Cash Grant. If we were to be required to pay under this guaranty, the Ivanpah Group would repay the amount through distributions.

Apart from the obligations addressed above, we do not anticipate any material impact on our liquidity and/or capital resources.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During 2008 and the ten-month period ended October 30, 2009, we had a partial ownership interest in Solar Partners II, LLC, or SPII. We accounted for this ownership interest under the equity method of accounting as discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements (“SPII Equity Method Investment”). On October 30, 2009, we acquired the remaining equity interest in this entity and, as such, this entity is consolidated in our consolidated financial statements for the period from November 1, 2009 to April 5, 2011. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements (“2009 Asset Acquisition”) for additional details.
In April 2011, we closed the financing of Ivanpah, to which SPII is a party with certain third-party equity investors and the DOE. See note 5 to our consolidated financial statements (“2011 Ivanpah Transaction”) for additional details.
Impact of Inflation
Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
Disclosure about Market Risk
Foreign Currency Risk
We have significant expenses, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. A majority of our employees are located in Israel, therefore, a substantial portion of our payroll as well as certain other operating expenses are paid in the Israeli shekel. Additionally, we purchase materials and components from suppliers in Asia and Europe. While we typically negotiate our agreements such that we pay these suppliers in U.S. dollars, their costs may be based upon the local currency of the country in which they operate. All of our revenues are currently valued in U.S. dollars; however, as we expand our international presence and levels of activity in other countries, we anticipate that revenues may be denominated in the local currency of those countries.
In the past, exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations of our Israeli subsidiaries. For example, the average exchange rate for the Israeli Shekel to the U.S. Dollar, increased by 5% for 2010 relative to 2009 and decreased by 4.5% in 2011 relative to

2010. Timing of Shekel-based payments, hedging and other activities we have utilized to mitigate currency risk, U.S. Dollar-based sourcing initiatives and changes in the relative economic activity over time between the United States and Israel all impact the degree to which these currency fluctuations impact our operations. The following table presents the estimated U.S. Dollar (in thousands) and percentage impact that currency movements have had on our cost of revenues and operating expenses.

We have not designated derivatives used to historically manage currency risk as hedges; therefore, adjustments to the fair values of forward contracts have been recognized through earnings as “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statements of operations for 2009 in the amount of approximately $0.4 million. Losses were recognized from foreign currency forward contracts. We have not utilized derivative financial instruments to manage currency risk since 2009.
Although we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations, we believe that we may have increased risk associated with currency fluctuations in the future as our operations expand and expenditures in currencies other than the U.S. dollar increases.
Interest Rate Risk
We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $37.8 million and $206.5 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. These amounts were held or invested in demand deposit accounts and money market funds. The cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short-term nature of our cash equivalents. Changes in interest rates, however, would impact future investment income.
Investors in solar thermal projects using our systems are exposed to interest rate risk because construction of these projects typically depends on debt financing. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for projects to secure financing on favorable terms, or at all, and thus lower demand for our systems. An increase in interest rates could also require us to lower our margins on system sales in order to sell our equipment to the projects.

Table of Contents

Interest rate risk also refers to our exposure to movements in interest rates associated with our interest bearing liabilities. The interest bearing liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars and the interest expense is based on various underlying indices plus an additional margin, depending on the respective lending institutions. Any change in these underlying indices would increase our interest expense. For example, a change in the indices underlying our variable rate borrowings of 100 basis points would increase our interest expense by approximately $0.3 million per year, assuming our variable interest bearing liabilities were to remain constant at December 31, 2011 levels.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in this prospectus. Our critical accounting policies include:
Revenues and Cost of Revenues
We typically sell our products and services to utility-scale solar thermal projects, contractors engaged by the project owners or project companies. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product or service has occurred, the sales price is fixed and determinable, collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer. We may have significant post-shipment obligations, including installation, training and customer acceptance clauses, including guarantees of project performance and warranties that could have an impact on revenue recognition.
Revenues generated from the construction of a solar thermal energy facility, including the associated equipment and services, on behalf of third parties, are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion method requires estimates of future costs over the full term of the project. Such cost estimates are made by management based on prior operations and specific project characteristics and designs. Historically, we have had significant cost variances between our cost estimates and actual costs incurred on our Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR contract. The revisions to the estimated loss primarily related to redesign work and change orders under the terms of the contract that could not be passed on to Chevron. We evaluate our estimates at least quarterly and updates its estimates based on the changes to the project. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from performance guarantees and warranties in relevant contracts and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for estimated losses relating to contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined.
 
67
Table of Contents

We do not recognize revenue for products and services sold to consolidated entities. For unconsolidated entities in which we are investors, we reduce the revenue recognized in proportion to our ownership interest.
We provide warranties and guarantees ensuring our products are suitable and meet certain quality, delivery and performance parameters. We accrue reserves to satisfy any potential product failure or failure to achieve specifications. We review these reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate to meet any potential failures or inability to meet any required parameters and adjust our estimates as needed. Due to our limited operating history our experience is limited and, as such, the adjustments we record may be material. Our customers may require us to post letters of credit or other security in order to guarantee performance under the relevant contracts.
The gross unfavorable changes in contract estimates were approximately $7.6 million, $18.0 million and $44.3 million for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, and primarily relate to the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project (as discussed below). The gross unfavorable changes in contract estimates for 2011 are comprised of $31.1 million for Coalinga and $13.2 million for Ivanpah. The gross favorable changes in contract estimates were $0, $0 and $6.1 million for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The favorable change in contract estimate for 2011 relates to the Ivanpah project.
Capitalized Project Costs
We capitalize costs incurred in connection with the development of solar thermal projects upon meeting specific project viability criteria. Evidence of project viability includes securing the site by option, lease, or acquisition; the evaluation of studies supporting the suitability of a site for the solar thermal project; and an off-take agreement or a viable economic analysis. Our viable economic analysis generally assesses the ability of the project to meet our required internal rates of return for project investments through expected cash distributions and other economic benefits (e.g., tax benefits) associated with the project, taking into account all capital, development and operating costs of the project, including debt financing costs. Upon satisfaction of these criteria, our management and project managers determine whether a project has met a project economic viability threshold and assess whether the specific project is probable to progress to full development and will ultimately realize future positive cash flows. Project costs incurred prior to meeting these thresholds are expensed as incurred. Upon meeting these thresholds, costs directly related to project development, including associated overhead, are capitalized. Capitalized project costs do not include administrative costs, marketing costs or other costs not directly associated with the development of the solar thermal project.
Consolidation of Special Purpose Entities
We typically form special purpose entities to capture all costs of developing a solar thermal project, which we refer to as project companies. These may be deemed to be variable interest entities, or VIEs. If the entity is deemed to be a VIE, we perform an analysis to determine whether our variable interest or interests give us a controlling financial interest. We evaluate our ability to direct the activities of the entity and our obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the entity in our financial statements. We do not recognize revenue for the supply of products and services to a project if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary.
During the initial development phases, we are typically the sole investor in these entities and are the primary beneficiary. As a project proceeds other partners may invest in the VIE. As other partners acquire interests in the VIE, we reevaluate whether we remain the primary beneficiary. If we should
 
68
Table of Contents

determine that we are no longer the primary beneficiary, we will deconsolidate the entity and recognize any gain or loss associated with the deconsolidation event.
Project Divestiture
When we cease to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary whether by sale, receipt of additional investment, sale of equity interests or contribution of assets or other transfer of an interest in a project company we first evaluate whether the transaction should be accounted for under the standard of deconsolidation of a subsidiary or a group of assets. If we have control of land or land rights, we further evaluate whether the assets are determined to be within the scope of the guidance for real estate sales. As part of this determination, we consider both (i) the stage of development of the project and (ii) the composition and the fair value of assets transferred or contributed within the project companies at the date of the transaction to determine whether a significant amount of the fair value of the assets is real estate or non-real estate. If the assets are determined to be in the scope of the guidance for real estate sales, the related net assets may continue to be presented in our consolidated financial statements until all requirements of the accounting standard for real estate sales have been satisfied. If the transaction is not within the scope of the standard for real estate sales, and we no longer exercise control over the project company or assets, we will typically deconsolidate the project company and will derecognize the related net assets associated with the project.
Share-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation expense was as follows:

We recognize compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including the awarding of employee stock options, based on the grant date estimated fair value. We amortize the fair value of the employee stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
In future periods, our share-based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of our existing unrecognized share-based compensation still to be recognized and as we issue additional share-based awards in order to attract and retain employees and nonemployee consultants.
Significant Factors, Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining Fair Value
We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share-based payment awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires inputs such as the expected term of the grant, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate. Further, the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation that we are required to record as an expense. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment.

We have estimated the expected term, which represents our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the stock options to remain outstanding, of all of our stock options that qualify for such estimation using the simplified method, as provided under authoritative guidance. The simplified method is calculated as the average of the time to vest and the contractual life of the options. We deemed it appropriate to use the simplified method as we have limited operating experience and share option exercise experience. Since we are a private entity with no historical data regarding the volatility of our common stock, the expected volatility used is based on volatility of similar publicly listed companies in comparable industries. In evaluating similarity, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle and market capitalization.
Our risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to each option’s expected term. Our expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero as we have not paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our shares of common stock. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors.
Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term, volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own share-based compensation on a prospective basis and incorporating these factors into the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant management and director judgment. If, in the future, we determine that another method for
 
70
Table of Contents

calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance and, therefore, should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term, the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly. Higher volatility and longer expected terms generally result in an increase to share-based compensation expense.

 	*	Stock options granted on January 6, 2011 and January 27, 2011 were granted based on the third-party valuation of our common stock as of October 31, 2010 that our compensation committee received in January 2011 (as described below). Subsequently, our compensation committee received a new valuation in March 2011 (as described below) establishing the per share fair market value for our common stock at $20.37 as of December 31, 2010. Because of the higher valuation as of December 31, 2010, in May and June 2011, we offered certain holders of outstanding options granted on January 6, 2011 and January 27, 2011 the opportunity to reprice such options to $20.37 to avoid any potential adverse tax treatment under Section 409A of the Code. The offer expired on June 27, 2011 and holders of outstanding options granted on January 6, 2011 and January 27, 2011 representing 54,133 shares (including all such holders employed in the U.S.) participated in the exchange.
All options granted by our compensation committee on the dates noted above were intended to be exercisable at the fair value of our stock based on information known at that time. The fair values of the common stock underlying our stock options have historically been determined by our compensation committee with input from management and an independent third-party valuation specialist.
In the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, our compensation committee has determined the fair value of the common stock utilizing methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the AICPA Practice Guide. In addition, our compensation committee considered numerous objective and subjective factors including:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
the prices for our convertible preferred stock sold to outside investors in arm’s-length transactions;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
the prices of our common stock sold to investors in arm’s-length transactions;

rights, preferences and privileges of that convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;

Our compensation committee considered common stock valuations performed as of February 28, 2010, July 31, 2010, October 31, 2010, December 31, 2010 April 26, 2011, August 31, 2011, November 30, 2011, January 31, 2012 and February 29, 2012, in determining or confirming the grant date fair value of common stock. Using these valuations, and the other factors described above, our compensation committee made the following estimates of fair value of our common stock.

The valuations that our compensation committee considered in determining the fair value of our common stock from February 28, 2010 through February 29, 2012 were estimated using the probability weighted expected return method, or PWERM, which considers various potential liquidity outcomes and assigns probabilities to each in order to arrive at a weighted equity value.
For each of the possible events, a range of future equity values is estimated, based on market, income and/or cost approaches over a range of possible event dates, all plus or minus a standard deviation for value and timing. For each equity and value scenario, the rights and preferences of each stockholder class are considered in order to determine the appropriate allocation of value to common shares. The value of each common share is then multiplied by a discount factor derived from the calculated discount rate and the expected timing of the event. A risk-adjusted discount rate is applied as the probability weightings in the PWERM address the success rates of each scenario. The value per common share, taking into account sensitivities to the timing of the event, is then multiplied by an
 
72
Table of Contents

estimated probability for each of the possible events. The calculated value per common share under the private company scenario is then discounted for the lack of marketability. A probability-weighted value per share of common stock is then determined.
PWERM is commonly used when a company anticipates an exit event within 12 to 18 months of its valuation date. As such, we believe this is a reasonable methodology as supported and reflected in our third-party valuation reports.
Discussion of Specific Valuation Inputs
We granted stock options in 2010, 2011 and 2012 with exercise prices between $12.78 and $29.43 per share. No single event caused the valuation of our common stock to increase or decrease from January 2010 to January 2012; rather, it has been a combination of factors that led to the changes in the fair value of the underlying common stock.
In April 2010, our compensation committee received a valuation of $12.78 per share of common stock as of February 28, 2010. Significant events during the period from January 2010 to February 2010 influencing this valuation included the February formal announcement by the DOE indicating their conditional commitment to provide a loan guarantee in the amount of $1.37 billion, which was subsequently increased to $1.6 billion. In addition, the first closing of our Series D preferred stock offering occurred with a value $20.1738 per share (as adjusted to reflect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our common stock and the resulting 1-for-3 conversion ratio adjustment applicable to our convertible preferred stock). At this first closing, $75.0 million was raised, primarily from current investors.
In August 2010, our compensation committee received a valuation of $14.49 per share of common stock as of July 31, 2010. Significant events during the period from March through July 2010 that influenced this valuation were the second, third and fourth closings of our Series D preferred stock offering in April, May and June 2010, respectively. In conjunction with the third closing of our Series D offering, we obtained a convertible note in the amount of $15.5 million with a new investor, Alstom. Valuation of the Series D offering was $20.1738 per share and included both new and existing investors.
In January 2011, our compensation committee received a valuation of $18.18 per share of common stock as of October 31, 2010. Significant events during the period from August to October 2010 were the conversion of the Alstom note into Series D preferred stock in August 2010 and our entering into a business partnership with Alstom in August 2010 to jointly market and bid on projects to design and construct solar thermal power plants in North Africa, South Africa and Southern Europe (subsequently expanded in December 2010 to include certain countries in the Middle East, in August 2011 to include India and in March 2012 to include Australia). In October 2010, we received final approval to commence construction on Ivanpah from all required governmental agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. NRG Solar also agreed to be the lead investor in Ivanpah in October 2010. Subsequent to receipt of the final permits for Ivanpah, we commenced construction in October 2010. On January 6, 2011 and January 27, 2011, our compensation committee approved an aggregate of 116,800 stock options based on the valuation as of October 31, 2010 that was received in January 2011. Subsequently, our compensation committee received a new valuation in March 2011 (as described below) establishing the per share fair market value for our common stock at $20.37 as of December 31, 2010. Because of the higher valuation as of December 31, 2010, in May and June 2011, we offered certain holders of outstanding options granted on January 6, 2011 and January 27, 2011 the opportunity to reprice such options to $20.37 to avoid any potential adverse tax treatment under Section 409A of the Code. The offer expired on June 27, 2011 and holders of outstanding options granted on January 6, 2011 and January 27, 2011 representing 54,133 shares (including all such holders employed in the U.S.) participated in the exchange.
In March 2011, our compensation committee received a valuation of $20.37 per share of common stock as of December 31, 2010. Significant events during November and December 2010 that
 
73
Table of Contents

influenced this valuation included the first closing of our Series E preferred stock offering in the amount of $27 million. In addition, we received a formal commitment for an additional $48 million, which was received in early January 2011. Additional events considered were the initial organizational meeting in contemplation of preparation of this offering, entering into a $75 million credit facility, and the signing of the $25 million Initial Hercules Term Loan. On March 18, 2011, the compensation committee approved 31,266 stock options based on the valuation as of December 31, 2010 that was received in March 2011. In establishing the fair market value of our common stock in connection with approving these grants, the compensation committee determined that, based upon the intervening circumstances (for example, uncertainty created by the project litigation filed in January 2011, the additional funding of the Series E preferred stock financing and the uncertainty of a project finance closing for Ivanpah) between December 31, 2010, the effective date of the valuation, and March 18, 2011, the grant date, the fair market value of our common stock was not greater than the fair market value determined by the valuation received in March 2011.
In April 2011, our compensation committee received a valuation of $22.56 per share of common stock as of April 25, 2011. Significant events during January, February and March 2011 that influenced this valuation included the final closing of our Series E preferred stock offering, which totaled $200 million. In addition, we also closed the project financing for all three projects at the Ivanpah site on April 5, 2011. On April 27, 2011 and May 2, 2011, the compensation committee approved an aggregate of 408,489 stock options based upon this valuation. These grants included 356,466 stock options granted to non-executive employees as part of our annual performance and merit compensation review process.
In September 2011, our compensation committee received a valuation of $29.43 per share of common stock as of August 31, 2011. Significant events during the period between May and August 2011 that influenced this valuation included, but are not limited to, continued progress at Ivanpah and the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project; filing the Application of Certification for the Hidden Hills Ranch Solar Electric Generating System; the introduction of SolarPLUS, which combines our solar power tower technology with two-tank molten-salt storage capabilities; and new additions to our senior management team. On September 9, 2011, the compensation committee approved an aggregate of 226,663 stock options based on this valuation.
In December 2011, our compensation committee received a valuation of $19.95 per share of common stock as of November 30, 2011. Significant events during the period between September and November 2011 that influenced this valuation included, but are not limited to, elevated volatility in financial markets, announcements of third quarter earnings from the clean-tech sector that fell short of analyst and investor expectations, meaningful reductions in renewable energy company stock prices, sector multiples compression and defensive investor posturing. Company milestones achieved during this period included continued progress at Ivanpah, commencement of operations using our solar thermal technology at the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam EOR project, filing the Application for Certification for the Rio Mesa Solar Electric Generating System and the addition of our SolarPLUS thermal energy storage capability to three of our power purchase agreements with Southern California Edison. On December 19, 2011, the compensation committee approved 54,296 stock options based on this valuation. Additionally, on December 19, 2011, the compensation committee approved a stock option grant to an individual for 31,666 shares to be effective upon the appointment of the individual as an nonemployee director, which occurred on December 29, 2011. The per share exercise price for such option is $19.95, the fair market value of a share of common stock on the effective date of the grant.
In February 2012, our compensation committee received a valuation of $20.01 per share of common stock as of January 31, 2012. Events during the period between December 2011 and January 2012 that influenced this valuation included, but are not limited to, a stabilizing equity market, varying investor sentiment and selectivity and limited cleantech new issuances. Company milestones achieved

during this period included continued progress at Ivanpah, the naming of Richard “Dick” Kelly (former Chairman and CEO of Xcel Energy) as Chairman of our board of directors and being selected by Sasol, a leading global energy and chemicals company, to conduct a study for use of our power tower technology in South Africa. On February 17, 2012, the compensation committee approved an aggregate of 11,326 stock options based upon this valuation.
In March 2012, our compensation committee received a valuation of $21.99 per share of common stock as of February 29, 2012. Events during February 2012 that influenced this valuation included, but are not limited to, our continued progress at Ivanpah, advancements in our international development efforts, the continued improvement in the equity markets, including a successful initial public offering by a company in the clean tech sector, the proposed agreement with Alstom with respect to a concurrent private placement, and continued progress towards our initial public offering. On March 19, 2012, the compensation committee approved an aggregate of 318,805 stock options with an exercise price of $22.02, a slight increase from the valuation received in light of an assumed public offering price of $22.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus.
Accounting for Guarantees
We are subject to various guarantees, including guarantees related to our solar field supply contracts, guarantees related to the our equity investment in Ivanpah HoldCo and various guarantees related to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We recognize a liability for the fair value of guarantees that meet the criteria of ASC 460—Guarantees. For those guarantees that are not within the scope of ASC 460, we apply the contingent liability model whereby we will accrue a liability if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable.
Estimating the fair value of these guarantees requires significant management judgment. The calculated fair values of these guarantees are subject to change if the underlying estimates and assumptions should change. These calculations are highly sensitive to changes in key assumptions and actual results may vary significantly from the current fair value estimates.
For the Bechtel Deferred Payment Guarantee that we have provided on behalf of Ivanpah HoldCo, we utilize the published default rates for corporate bonds of companies with similar credit ratings and tenors. If the corporate default rates should change, we will experience a change in fair value. For example, if the default rate should increase by 50%, it would result in a corresponding change of $0.1 million in increased fair value.
The Cost Overrun Funding Guarantee, in which we have committed to funding any Ivanpah construction cost overruns in excess of a base contingency provision and a defined funded contingency overrun, together totaling $123.7 million, is reliant on assumptions regarding the monetary value of any cost overruns and the probability that such overruns might occur. As of December 31, 2011, we currently forecast these cost overruns will be approximately $96.6 million, which is $27.1 million below the $123.7 million guarantee threshold. If the actual cost overruns were to exceed our current forecast by more than 28%, however, we would be required to pay under this guarantee all of the excess costs and would not be entitled to recover this additional funding through future distributions from the Ivanpah equity owners. If, for example, the actual cost overruns were to exceed the current forecast by 50%, we would be required to pay additional costs of approximately $21.2 million under this guarantee.
At December 31, 2011, we estimated the fair value of the guarantee by applying a probability-weighted model to various identified cost outcomes and then comparing the resulting values to the $123.7 million guarantee threshold. Using this approach, the fair value of the guarantee liability was estimated to be approximately $0.3 million at December 31, 2011. Under this model, any change in the
 
75
Table of Contents

probability weighting associated with any particular cost outcome or the identification of different cost outcomes would result in a different estimated fair value.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Our global operations involve project development, manufacturing, research and development and marketing activities. Profit from non-U.S. activities is subject to local country taxes but generally not subject to United States tax until repatriated to the United States. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that management believes are prudent and feasible in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made.
The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the ultimate tax assessment is proven to be more than our estimate of tax liabilities, a further charge to earnings would result.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04 (“ASU 2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. This new guidance is to be applied prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2012. We do not expect the adoption of this standard will substantially change our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes.

BUSINESS
Company Overview
BrightSource is a leading solar thermal technology company that designs, develops and sells proprietary systems that produce reliable, clean energy in utility-scale electric power plants. Our systems use proprietary solar power tower technology to deliver cost-competitive renewable electricity with characteristics highly valued by utilities, such as reliability and consistency. Our systems are also used by industrial companies to create high-temperature steam for use in applications such as enhanced oil recovery, or EOR.
Our systems use fields of tracking mirrors, known as heliostats, controlled by our proprietary software to concentrate sunlight onto a solar receiver/boiler unit to produce high-temperature steam. Once produced, the steam is used either in a conventional steam turbine to produce electricity or in industrial applications such as thermal EOR. By integrating conventional power block components, such as turbines, with our proprietary technology and state-of-the-art solar field design, projects using our systems can deliver cost-competitive, reliable and clean power when needed most. In addition, by incorporating thermal storage and integrating our technology with natural gas or other fossil fuels through a process referred to as hybridization, projects using our systems can further increase output and reliability.
In implementing systems using our proprietary technology, we partner with several parties to develop utility-scale, solar electric power plants. These parties include engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, contractors; boiler suppliers; turbine suppliers; and financing parties that may consist of strategic and/or financial investors.
While we primarily sell systems using our proprietary technology, we also act as the system architect for the layout and optimization of the solar field. In addition, we provide technical services related to the design, engineering and operation of our systems and may provide overall project development services. During the construction phase of a project, we receive revenue from the sale of our proprietary technology. For the projects where we lead development, we expect to own initially 100% of the equity in the projects, but may seek development partners on specific projects. We intend to ultimately sell, accept additional investors, contribute or otherwise transfer the majority of the equity in these projects to third parties while retaining a minority equity interest, as we did with Ivanpah.
The principal members of our technical team pioneered the first utility-scale solar energy plants nearly three decades ago by designing and developing 354 megawatt, or MW, of solar thermal power systems, which remain in operation today. Our technical team has moved beyond these initial solar thermal technologies by engineering a solar power tower system that provides both higher solar energy conversion efficiencies and lower costs. Our team has extensive solar thermal technical and project development expertise and has collectively developed, constructed and managed more than 25 gigawatts, or GW, of solar, wind and conventional power projects worldwide.
We have produced high-temperature steam using our technology since 2008, when we commenced operations at our 6 megawatt thermal, or MWth demonstration solar-to-steam facility, the Solar Energy Development Center, in Israel. We believe this facility has consistently produced the highest temperature and pressure steam of any solar thermal facility in the world, capable of driving highly efficient, cost-effective turbines. This facility validated our technology and continues to provide important operational and production data.
Through our project companies, we have 13 executed and outstanding long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, to deliver approximately 2.4 GW of installed capacity to two of the largest electric utilities in the United States, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, or PG&E, and Southern California Edison, or SCE. We believe these PPAs represent one of the largest utility-scale solar pipelines in the United States and should provide us with a significant revenue opportunity between 2012 and 2016. For
 
78
Table of Contents

purposes of illustration, our agreements for the supply of equipment and services to the Ivanpah project, which has three PPAs totaling 377 MW, represent $672.0 million of contracted sales, which equates to approximately $1.8 million of contracted sales per MW. Consistent with our 14% ownership in Ivanpah, we recognize 86% of any actual sales as revenue. As the first step in fulfilling our obligations under the PPAs, in October 2010, we initiated construction on Ivanpah, a project comprised of three concentrating solar thermal power plants on an approximately 3,500 acre site in California’s Mojave Desert. As of February 2012, the three power plants at Ivanpah were 26.5%, 18.3% and 15.7% complete, respectively, and overall EPC at Ivanpah was 25.2% complete. When commissioned, Ivanpah will have an installed capacity of 377 MW and will increase the amount of solar thermal generation capacity currently installed in the United States by over 75%.
We have an approximately 90,000 acre development site portfolio under our control in California and the U.S. Southwest that has the potential to accommodate approximately 9 GW (gross) of installed capacity. We currently have three sites in advanced development, Rio Mesa Solar and Hidden Hills Ranch, each located in California, and Sandy Valley, located in Nevada. Rio Mesa Solar consists of approximately 5,800 acres, Hidden Hills Ranch consists of approximately 3,300 acres, and Sandy Valley consists of approximately 10,000 acres. In August and October 2011, we filed Applications for Certification with the California Energy Commission for the development of solar power plants at Hidden Hills Ranch and Rio Mesa Solar, respectively. Although Sandy Valley will not require an Application for Certification because it is located in Nevada, similar permitting activity will begin in 2012.
In 2007, we entered the thermal EOR business after Chevron selected our technology through a competitive process. After winning the business, we signed a contract with Chevron in 2008 to provide a 29 MWth EOR facility in Coalinga, California. We commenced construction of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project in 2009, and the project began operations in October 2011.
In addition to our relationship with Chevron, we have strategic relationships with global, industry-leading companies, including Alstom, Bechtel and NRG Solar. In order to accelerate the adoption of our systems globally, we are leveraging these relationships and our world-class partners’ local expertise in domestic and international markets to pursue expansion opportunities more rapidly and cost-effectively than might otherwise be possible. Particularly for our international markets, we intend to enter into additional strategic relationships with other leading companies that are active in the regions where we are pursuing project opportunities.
We were initially formed on April 5, 2004, as Luz II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and began our operations on May 1, 2006. On August 17, 2006, the LLC was converted to Luz II, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and changed its name to BrightSource Energy, Inc. in May 2007.
Industry Overview
Growing Global Demand for Electricity and Renewable Energy Technology
According to a report released in 2011 by the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, global demand for electric power is expected to increase 84% from 2008 to 2035, reaching 35.2 trillion kilowatt hours. Although fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas generated approximately 68% of the world’s electricity in 2008, several factors are driving the increase in demand for renewable energy sources. These factors include carbon dioxide emission reduction targets, government regulatory policies and incentives, cost, safety and environmental impacts of conventional power and the increase in long-term global energy consumption. According to the EIA, global renewable energy, excluding hydroelectric energy, constituted 2.8% of electricity generation in 2008 and is expected to increase to 7.4% in 2035. Among renewable sources of electricity, we believe utility-scale solar thermal technology has the potential to meet a significant share of the world’s growing electricity needs due to the abundant nature of solar resources and the ability to reliably produce power when needed most.

Table of Contents

One of the significant factors driving our growth in the United States is state-mandated RPS. In many states, including California, relevant legislation currently requires an increasing percentage of the electricity supplied by electric utility companies operating in such states be derived from renewable energy resources until certain pre-established goals are met. Outside of the United States, several key target markets for us including South Africa, Australia, China and India have also implemented specific solar targets, often coupled with financial incentives such as feed-in tariffs.
Utility-Scale Solar Energy Technologies
There are two primary categories of utility-scale solar energy technologies used to generate electricity:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Photovoltaic, or PV:    An electricity-producing technology in the form of solar cells generally arranged in modules that converts sunlight directly into electricity. The principal photovoltaic (PV) technologies are based on crystalline silicon or thin-film solar cells. Another method of using PV solar energy is concentrated PV (CPV), where sunlight from a larger area is concentrated onto PV cells or modules. PV technology is based on specialized materials releasing electrons and creating direct current (DC) electricity when light energy at certain wavelengths reaches the specialized materials in the cells.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Solar Thermal:    A thermal technology that uses reflective materials to concentrate the energy in sunlight onto receivers that collect and convert the energy to heat. This heat is then converted to electricity, usually by introducing pressurized steam into a conventional steam turbine to produce AC power. Utility-scale solar thermal technologies can deliver high electricity output per unit of capacity due to sun tracking and optimization of solar field size and layout. Such solar resource is in abundance in many regions of the world with high electricity demand. Utility-scale solar thermal technologies can be further complemented with on-site storage and are suitable for hybridization with conventional fossil fuels to create a generating asset with more firm and reliable power characteristics than other forms of intermittent energy generation. Solar thermal is frequently referred to as concentrating solar thermal (CST) or concentrating solar power (CSP).

There are two primary solar thermal technologies being pursued today:
 
 	•	 	
Power Tower:    A system that uses heliostats to track the sun on two axes to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver at the top of a tower to heat a fluid. Power tower systems using our technology use water as the working fluid, which is heated to create high-temperature steam that is then used in a conventional turbine to generate electricity. Some competing technologies use a mixture of molten salts, which, after absorbing heat from concentrated solar energy, produce high-temperature, pressurized steam in a heat exchanger.

 
 	•	 	
Parabolic Trough:    A system that uses long arrays of single-axis tracking, curved parabolic mirrors to reflect sunlight onto a receiver tube which contains a heat transfer fluid such as oil. The fluid then is passed through a heat exchanger, where heat is transferred from the fluid to water to create pressurized steam. This steam is then used in a conventional turbine to generate electricity.

Parabolic trough systems produce steam at lower temperatures and pressures than power tower systems resulting in a lower solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency and higher costs. There are two additional solar thermal technologies, compact linear fresnel reflector and Stirling dish, neither of which have any projects over 50 MW under construction or in operation. Power tower technology benefits from being both more efficient (mainly because of the higher operating temperature and pressures, reduced parasitic energy use and lower heat losses) and less expensive than other solar thermal technologies.

Solar thermal electric generation has grown significantly in recent decades. Today, there are approximately 1,200 MW of installed solar thermal generation facilities worldwide and approximately 11,000 MW under construction or development. The United States currently has approximately 500 MW of installed capacity, representing roughly 40% of the worldwide total, and is the global leader in capacity under construction or development, representing roughly 60% of the total market. Of the capacity in the United States, approximately 70% was designed and developed by principal members of our technical team.
Enhanced Oil Recovery
Conventional oil recovery methods are only able to extract about 10% to 30% of the original oil from a reservoir, leaving nearly 70% to 90% of the oil in-place. Crude oil development and production can include up to three distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or enhanced) recovery. During primary recovery, natural pressure from the reservoir drives oil into the wellbore. This, combined with artificial lift techniques such as pumping, brings the oil to the surface, but typically only produces about 10% of a reservoir’s original oil in place. Secondary recovery techniques enhance the field’s productive life by injecting water or gases to displace oil and drive it to the wellbore, resulting in the recovery of 20% to 40% of the original oil in-place. However, with much of the easy-to-produce oil already recovered from developed oilfields, producers have attempted several tertiary techniques that offer prospects for ultimately recovering 30% to 60%, or more, of the reservoir’s original oil in place. This tertiary segment is generally referred to as enhanced oil recovery, or EOR.
Many oilfields worldwide have experienced a decline in oil production. Using EOR has the potential to reverse this downward trend and increase worldwide proven reserves by as much as 240 billion barrels of oil, according to SBI Energy. EOR processes are critical to extending the productive life of some of the world’s largest and longest-producing oilfields. In addition, large volumes of proven oil reserves remain unrecovered. EOR technologies are both attractive and feasible, particularly when coupled with rising government interest and investment, rising oil prices, new technologies, and more cost-effective methodologies. According to BCC Research, the global market for EOR technologies was $4.7 billion in 2009 and is expected to grow at a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 28% to $16.3 billion in 2014.
There are currently three commercially viable methods for EOR: thermal recovery, gas injection and chemical injection. According to the DOE, thermal EOR, which principally uses steam, accounts for over 40% of current U.S. EOR production, primarily in California. EOR using solar thermal technology, or solar thermal EOR, has emerged as a highly attractive alternative for steam generation because it significantly reduces emissions and fuel costs.
In addition to EOR, solar thermal technology can provide a supplemental source of steam for existing or new steam systems such as traditional power plants and other industrial applications such as mining and desalination.
Our Opportunities
For Utility Applications
As demand for energy grows globally, renewable resources are becoming an increasingly important part of fulfilling that demand. This demand for renewable energy is expected to increase as a result of regulatory policies and incentives put in place to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve energy security. For instance, California has recently adopted legislation requiring all California retail energy sellers, including municipal power agencies, to derive 33% of the energy they supply from renewable energy sources by 2020. In addition, recent global events have called into

question future energy production from nuclear facilities, which the EIA in 2011 estimated will represent 13.9% of the global electricity generation in 2035. To the extent that production is cancelled or delayed, renewable energy sources will likely be called upon to help bridge the gap. However, increased demand for renewable energy sources is presenting a number of grid integration challenges.
Transmission and distribution of electric power to consumers requires highly complex operating systems. Electricity generation generally must equal electricity consumption at every moment because electricity cannot currently be economically stored. As electricity demand fluctuates throughout the day, the combined output of all available electric generators must continuously be ramped up or down to meet changing demand levels. Among the many measures taken to ensure reliable and consistent electricity supply, utilities and grid operators (operators of electric transmission and distribution infrastructure) in particular require the following:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Sufficient generation capacity available to meet peak demand:    Peak demand represents the highest point of electricity consumption during any given period. Over an annual period, peak demand generally occurs in the afternoon during hot summer days when there is a dramatic increase in the use of cooling equipment, such as air conditioners. Failure to meet peak demand even for short periods of time can, at its worst, result in rolling blackouts and power outages. Therefore, the grid operator must carry a certain quantity of reserve generation capacity to ensure sufficient availability of power at peak as well as to respond to other reliability needs.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Sufficient flexible power production:    As electric demand or supply changes over the course of the day, grid operators must ensure that there are flexible generation resources, such as dispatchable fossil fuel plants, that can vary their production on demand. In general, the production costs of these flexible generation sources are higher than those of baseload power sources, such as coal and nuclear power plants. The addition of renewable resources, which are intermittent and vulnerable to changes in wind and sunlight, creates new requirements for such flexible generation to balance the variable supply of renewable resources.

When procuring renewable energy, one factor utilities consider is power price. Currently, well-sited wind power plants typically can offer a lower price than those of PV or solar thermal. However, this is not the only factor utilities must consider, particularly as renewable energy production increases. Although wind and PV power plants also provide clean energy with low variable costs compared to fossil fuel alternatives, their production characteristics present a number of integration and reliability challenges for utilities and grid operators. Our cost-competitive power tower technology responds to these growing system integration requirements by providing clean energy with characteristics highly valued by utilities, such as reliability and production during peak load hours. As a result, electric power plants using our systems have higher reliability value and lower integration costs than intermittent renewable technologies such as wind and PV. Furthermore, our system has the potential for thermal energy storage and hybridization, which ease integration within the existing power infrastructure. The ultimate decision regarding whether to implement storage and the level of hybridization in our systems depends on its economic benefits and local and national regulations.
The Grid Integration Challenges and Costs of Utility-Scale Wind and PV
As demand for power continues to grow globally, and renewable energy becomes a larger part of utilities’ resource portfolios, the challenges and costs of integrating renewable resources into the power system have become an important planning consideration. These integration challenges for utilities and grid operators include:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Insufficient generation capacity at peak demand:    Demand for power tends to peak daily in the late afternoon or early evening, especially in summer. Wind resources tend to be more

 
82

consistently available at night, when the demand for power is typically lower than during the day. Production of electricity from solar technologies is better aligned with periods of peak demand. However, neither wind nor PV systems can be counted on to operate at their full capacity at the time of day when demand for power and the price offered to power producers is highest.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Inconsistent power production:    Wind turbines or PV installations produce power only during periods of adequate wind resource or sunlight, as applicable. Their output can change suddenly as weather conditions change, causing production to drop quickly and sometimes unexpectedly and then resume just as suddenly and possibly without adequate warning to grid operators. Such characteristics present significant challenges to grid operators and can require procurement of additional expensive, flexible generation reserves.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Lack of economical storage alternatives:    While traditional power generation sources can effectively store fuel that can be deployed as needed in the form of electric power, there is currently no economical way to store energy from wind and PV sources. As a result, absent significant additional expense, wind and PV projects can only produce energy when wind or sunlight is available.

Due to the challenges associated with integrating wind and PV, utilities are adjusting their procurement policies to value the capacity that is delivered by these sources less than power from generation sources with more reliable production at peak periods of demand. Utilities calculate this value using various measures, including an on-peak availability factor, which measures the amount of energy on average that can be delivered at peak hours as a percentage of the generator’s total capacity. Conventional sources of power, such as a combined cycle gas turbine, have on-peak availability factors above 90%, and can be relied upon to generate power when needed and on short notice. The ideal source of renewable power would exhibit similar characteristics to conventional sources of power, without the high fuel costs and negative environmental impacts associated with these technologies. Currently, according to the modeling work prepared for the California Public Utilities Commission by Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc., in California, a wind project on average delivers 16% of its total capacity at peak hours and a fixed-tilt PV project on average delivers 51% of its total capacity at peak hours. In contrast, a solar thermal project on average delivers 77% of its total capacity at peak hours. This percentage may increase with limited hybridization and thermal energy storage. We believe this high on-peak availability, combined with the fact that a solar thermal project delivers a more consistent and reliable power source, makes solar thermal technologies an attractive solution for utilities.
As utilities incorporate wind and PV into their portfolios, they are also finding that system integration costs increase accordingly. These integration costs include the following elements:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Regulation, also known as regulating reserve:    The cost of addressing short-term fluctuations (seconds or minutes) in either supply, such as sudden changes in wind or solar generation, or in demand.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Load following:    The cost of procuring dispatchable generation to meet the combined upward and downward fluctuations in demand and wind and solar energy generation.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Unit commitment costs:    The cost of starting and stopping conventional generators more frequently in order to address fluctuations in wind and solar production.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Incremental capital investment costs:    The cost of retrofitting or building new generation assets to provide support for renewable energy integration into the grid when existing assets cannot provide the required level of support.

These system integration costs, combined with generation and transmission expenses as well as energy and capacity benefits, comprise the net system cost to the utility. Net system costs have been rising as more energy is produced and procured from wind and PV and, as a result, utilities, grid operators and regulators are placing increasing importance on net system costs when evaluating new renewable energy capacity.

As discussed in “—Our Technology Solution—For Utility Applications” below, our technology has the capability to reduce these costs and support reliability while providing clean power.
For Thermal EOR and Other Industrial Applications
While systems using our technology are primarily used to generate electricity, they can also be used for the production of steam for industrial process applications, such as thermal EOR. EOR is important to the future of oil production, and steam flooding for thermal EOR has proven an effective method of increasing production from heavy oil reserves. Many oil production companies, such as Chevron, Exxon, Occidental and Shell, have significant potential to utilize solar thermal EOR as part of planned or actual EOR programs. Many oilfields that could utilize EOR, and specifically solar thermal EOR, are located in remote locations with limited access to other fossil fuel energy sources. Accordingly, obtaining traditional fuel sources leads to high fuel costs.
In addition to thermal EOR, the market to provide steam to customers, particularly those with significant steam requirements and/or remote operations, includes off-grid electrical generation and other industrial applications such as mining and desalination.
Our Technology Solution
For Utility Applications
Our proprietary solar thermal technology is engineered to produce predictable, reliable and clean energy at a competitive cost. Our solution is specifically designed to address the challenges of utility-scale renewable power generation. Electric power plants using our systems provide:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Sufficient generation capacity at peak demand:    Our power production profile, or the amount of power our systems produce at different times of the day, can be tailored to the demand profile that most utilities serve. We optimize our solar field layouts and heliostats to maximize energy production at the time of day when power is in greatest demand. Our technology is able to capture the late afternoon sun more efficiently than fixed-tilt PV panels, as our advanced software adjusts each heliostat individually to continue to track the exact position of the sun, even into the early evening. This enables electric power plants using our systems to deliver more power during times of peak demand. We expect that the on-peak availability of Ivanpah will be significantly higher than electric power plants using wind or fixed-tilt PV, on average. Our production profile also enables electric power plants using our systems to receive higher average prices for power. For instance, in some areas, such as California, utilities such as PG&E and SCE are willing to pay contract prices for peak power supply that are as much as three times the base price for each megawatt hour, or MWh, of delivered energy. This significantly enhances the average revenue per MWh that electric power plants using our systems are able to generate compared to wind systems that typically produce power well below their capacity during peak demand periods.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
More reliable and consistent power output:    Electric power plants using our systems produce more predictable power output than that of highly intermittent renewable sources such as wind and PV. Because our technology converts solar energy into steam, rather than directly into electricity, the system temperature remains high enough to continue to generate electricity through short periods of intermittent cloud cover. Therefore, electric power plants using our systems are less likely to experience sudden and unexpected power output fluctuations. In addition, we expect that electric power plants using our systems will be able to bridge prolonged reductions in solar power output by discharging energy from a thermal energy storage system or by burning small amounts of natural gas, referred to as hybridization. With electric power plants using our systems, utilities and grid operators will require less backup generation compared to competing wind and PV energy sources.

 	Ÿ	 	
Increased production capability through thermal energy storage and hybridization:    In contrast to wind and PV, our technology allows the incorporation of existing cost-effective thermal energy storage and hybridization. This feature can extend the hours of our production period even after the sun goes down, which is particularly important in areas where demand and prices for power remain high later in the day. Shifting electricity generation to critical, peak hours will command higher energy prices (higher average PPA prices) for power plants using our systems. In addition, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL, thermal energy storage reduces the cost of electricity by increasing capacity factor and increases the total thermal energy production from a solar field. As a result, thermal energy storage can be used to control the daily supply curve of power plants using our technology, reduce system integration costs and increase reliability and consistency. As utilities purchase greater amounts of electricity from renewable energy sources, we believe the ability to implement energy storage will make our system increasingly valuable to utilities and grid operators. In addition, systems using our technology can be used in combination with traditional fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil and coal, in hybrid generation plants. This hybridization could be operationally very similar to conventional, dispatchable power plants while enabling utilities to save on costs and reduce carbon dioxide emissions during hours when the sun is shining.

As a result of the advantages discussed above, electric power plants using our systems deliver electricity with characteristics highly valued by utilities, such as reliability and flexibility, at a competitive net system cost. In addition, by providing energy during peak demand when utilities are willing to pay the highest price, electric power plants using our systems are able to maximize the revenue realized from the sale of electricity. As the power grid is loaded with increasing quantities of renewable resources such as wind and PV over time, we believe that we will have a competitive advantage over other renewable technologies that impose higher integration costs and do not produce electricity as reliably during periods of peak demand.
For Thermal EOR and Other Industrial Applications
Our solar-to-steam solution for thermal EOR, off-grid electricity and other industrial applications is designed to offer oil production and other industrial companies a cost-effective, emission-free alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based steam generation. Our solar-to-steam solution has several advantages:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Lower levelized cost than fossil-based alternatives in regions that lack access to reliable, economic fuel sources.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Less volatile total cost through lower exposure to fuel price increases.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Simple to integrate with fossil-fired generation systems allowing for reduced fuel cost and emissions during daylight hours.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Flexible to produce steam for multiple applications including thermal EOR, off-grid electricity and other industrial applications.

Our power tower technology has the same competitive advantages over other solar thermal technologies for thermal EOR, off-grid electricity and other industrial applications as it does for utility applications: lower capital cost, higher efficiency, higher capacity factor, reduced impact on the environment, and easy adaptation to varying topographical conditions. In addition to these advantages, we believe that the completion of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project in California will provide us with a significant competitive advantage over other solar thermal EOR technologies that have not been proven at large scale. We intend to leverage our solar technology in key regions where there is a combination of good solar resource and oil reserves, such as California and the Middle East.

Our Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths position us as a leader within the utility-scale renewable energy market:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Superior technology:    We believe our technology represents a compelling solution for utilities seeking superior performance at a competitive cost. The foundation of our technology is our solar field optimization software and proprietary control system that together optimize the output of energy from our system to match the needs of utilities and maximize project revenue. As a result of our proprietary technology, electric power plants using our systems provide more reliable energy output at peak demand than those of PV or wind. Our system can deliver clean, reliable power that naturally extends late in the day, and can be complemented with our SolarPLUS thermal energy storage to address peak electricity demands and the need for reliable, consistent power production at a competitive cost. In addition, our system has the capability to augment the electricity production and improve reliability through hybridization with conventional fossil fuels.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Substantial revenue visibility with fully committed, long-term agreements:    Through our project companies, we have 13 executed and outstanding PPAs with two of the largest electric utilities in the United States, PG&E and SCE to deliver approximately 2.4 GW of installed capacity. Three of the PPAs are associated with Ivanpah. We retain 10 PPAs to deliver approximately 2.0 GW of installed capacity. We believe these PPAs represent one of the largest utility-scale solar pipelines in the United States and should provide us with a significant revenue opportunity between 2012 and 2016. For purposes of illustration, our agreements for the supply of equipment and services to the Ivanpah project, which has three PPAs totaling 377 MW, represent $672.0 million of contracted sales, which equates to approximately $1.8 million of contracted sales per MW. Consistent with our 14% ownership in Ivanpah, we recognize 86% of any actual sales as revenue.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Experienced management team:    In the energy industry, the experience that comes from years of designing, building and operating utility-scale projects is critical. The principal members of our technical team pioneered the first utility-scale solar energy plant nearly three decades ago by designing and developing 354 MW of solar thermal power plants that remain in operation today. These plants represent approximately 70% of the solar thermal generation capacity currently installed in the United States. Our team has extensive solar thermal technical and project development expertise and has collectively developed, constructed, and managed more than 25 GW of solar, wind and conventional power projects worldwide.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Demonstrated alternative applications of our solar thermal technology:    In addition to our electric utility application, our technology provides the oil and gas industry with a clean, emission-free alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based steam generation methods for thermal EOR. Using solar power to produce steam for thermal EOR is particularly attractive in remote areas with limited infrastructure or high fuel costs. EOR and other industrial process applications of our technology diversify our revenue stream and contribute to our future growth globally.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Strong global partners that support our expansion:    We believe our partnerships with leading global companies such as Alstom, Chevron, NRG Solar and Bechtel provide a strong competitive advantage. By leveraging these relationships and our world-class partners’ local expertise in domestic and international markets, we believe we can enter new markets and pursue expansion opportunities more rapidly and cost-effectively than might otherwise be possible. Currently, our key relationships include:

 
 	•	 	
Alstom:    In May 2010, ALSTOM Power Inc. became a stockholder of the Company. In conjunction with this investment, we began business partnership discussions that led to us signing a multi-year business partnership agreement with Alstom in August 2010 to

 
86
Table of Contents

 	
jointly market and bid on projects to design and construct solar thermal power plants in Northern Africa, South Africa and Southern Europe. We subsequently expanded this partnership to include the Middle East, India and Australia.

 
 	•	 	
Chevron:    An affiliate of Chevron Corporation made an initial investment in us in 2006. This investment led to business discussions for the use of our systems in a solar-to-steam EOR application. In 2008 we signed an agreement to construct a 29 MWth solar-to-steam EOR facility under a master service agreement with an affiliate of Chevron. We commenced construction of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project in 2009, and the project began operations in October 2011. We are actively discussing additional thermal EOR deployment and other business opportunities with Chevron.

 
 	•	 	
NRG Solar:    NRG Solar LLC, a subsidiary of NRG Energy, is the lead investor of Ivanpah, investing up to $300 million in the three phases of Ivanpah. NRG Solar is also the operator of Ivanpah.

 
 	•	 	
Bechtel:    We selected Bechtel Power Corporation as the EPC contractor for Ivanpah. In addition, Bechtel participated in the financing for each of the three phases of Ivanpah.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
High-quality development site portfolio:    To accelerate the development of our systems and satisfy our signed PPAs, we are developing solar thermal projects in the United States. Our rigorous site evaluation and screening process identifies high-quality development sites, and is further enhanced by our extensive regulatory and permitting experience. We have a development site portfolio of approximately 90,000 acres under our control in California and the U.S. Southwest that is well suited for solar power generation. This portfolio has the potential to accommodate approximately 9 GW (gross) of installed capacity. With abundant land, high levels of direct sunlight, geographic proximity to large and growing population centers and strong incentives for renewable power, California and the U.S. Southwest represent some of the most attractive markets for solar thermal applications in the world.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Low impact design:    Our systems are designed to have a low impact on the site, limiting changes to topography, soil conditions and vegetation. The heliostats used to focus the sun’s energy on our central tower are mounted on pylons that are driven directly into the ground. Unlike some other renewable energy technologies, such as PV, wind and other competing solar thermal systems, our system greatly reduces the need for concrete pads or extensive land grading. Our systems also cost-effectively use air instead of water to cool steam, which reduces water usage by more than 90% over competing solar thermal technologies that use conventional wet-cooling systems. Given the regulatory restrictions and public concerns for water usage in desert environments, we believe this is an important advantage over other solar thermal technologies that use wet-cooling systems.

Our Growth Strategies
We intend to pursue the following growth strategies to maintain and expand our position as a leader within the utility scale renewable energy market:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Leverage our PPAs into sales of systems using our technology:    We intend to use our high-quality development site portfolio to create attractive opportunities for projects where we can sell our solar thermal technology. By executing on these opportunities, we expect to generate substantial revenue, cash flow and profit growth, providing us with the ability to scale and the resources needed to pursue broader growth opportunities.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Focus on identifying and creating additional opportunities to sell our systems:    We focus our business development efforts on identifying new projects and additional PPAs in domestic markets and work with strategic partners in international target markets that are characterized by high levels of direct sunlight and energy demand. In addition, we expect to

 
87
Table of Contents

 	
leverage the performance of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project to establish additional relationships for thermal EOR and other solar-to-steam applications.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Develop additional relationships with global industry leaders:    We intend to create new relationships with global industry leaders to expand our business. We intend to leverage these new and existing relationships to enter additional markets and pursue expansion opportunities more rapidly and cost-effectively. For example, in February 2012, we entered into an agreement with Sasol, a leading global energy and chemicals company, to conduct a comprehensive front-end engineering and design study for a potential project utilizing our technology in South Africa.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Continue to improve our proprietary solar thermal technology:    While our systems are currently cost-competitive, we expect our technology roadmap to yield significant cost reductions and a lower net system cost to utilities. We expect improvements to our technology such as higher temperature and pressure operation, software enhancements and larger power blocks, to increase our competitiveness through higher solar energy conversion efficiencies, lower capital costs and increased power production. Our intellectual property portfolio, technical expertise and commitment to research and development have been critical to our success. We intend to continue to lead innovation in solar thermal technology and drive greater capital and operating efficiencies with each new generation of solar power tower technology.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Enhance operating characteristics utilities value most:    We recently introduced solar thermal energy storage capabilities and intend to integrate additional features that enhance our system such as hybridization where appropriate. We expect these features to yield a lower net system cost to utilities through greater on-peak availability, higher reliability and increased output.

Our Pipeline Execution and Business Development
Through our project companies that are direct parties to the PPAs, we have 13 executed and out-standing PPAs with two of the largest electric utilities in the United States, PG&E and SCE, to deliver approximately 2.4 GW of installed capacity. We believe these PPAs represent one of the largest utility-scale solar pipelines in the United States and should provide us with a significant revenue opportunity between 2012 and 2016. For purposes of illustration, our agreements for the supply of equipment and services to the Ivanpah project, which has three PPAs totaling 377 MW, represent $672.0 million of contracted sales, which equates to approximately $1.8 million of contracted sales per MW. Consistent with our 14% ownership in Ivanpah, we recognize 86% of any actual sales as revenue. We attempt to match each signed PPA with a site in our development portfolio that is consistent with and fulfills the requirements of the PPA. Depending on the size of a given site, multiple PPAs can be associated with it. For example, three of the PPAs we signed are associated with Ivanpah. We retain 10 PPAs to deliver approximately 2.0 GW of installed capacity. As part of meeting our obligations under these 10 PPAs, we have a robust development site portfolio comprised of approximately 90,000 acres of land under our control across California and the U.S. Southwest. This site portfolio has the potential to accommodate approximately 9 GW (gross) of installed capacity.
There are several key phases of the site development process including the identification, design, permitting, financing, construction and placement into commercial operation of each project. For the projects where we lead development, we expect to own initially 100% of the equity in the projects but may seek development partners on specific projects. A project’s assets are typically held by a special purpose, single member limited liability company, in which we are initially the sole member, that we refer to as a project company. We intend to ultimately transfer the majority of the equity in each project company to third parties while retaining a minority equity interest. Until the time of such transfer, we expect to wholly own each project company and consolidate its profits and losses.

Ivanpah, the first project that will deliver power to serve PPAs that we have signed, is comprised of three concentrating solar thermal power plants. This project combines attractive solar conditions with readily available access to electric transmission, water and natural gas access. Ivanpah is located on an approximately 3,500 acre site in California’s Mojave Desert and will have an installed capacity of 377 MW.
While our engineering team is actively engaged in the technical design of Ivanpah, Bechtel is leading its construction and NRG Solar will manage its operation. We have guaranteed all obligations of our subsidiaries that have entered agreements to provide solar field systems and services for each of three phases of Ivanpah. We are also required to fund an escrow of approximately $108.6 million by April 2012 to secure potential construction delay and performance damage payments or warranty liabilities under these solar field system and service agreements.
All three Ivanpah phases have fully committed equity and debt financing of approximately $2.2 billion to fund construction costs, together with other project costs such as interest during construction, sales tax, mitigation and development costs, interconnection costs, cost contingencies and debt reserves. Ivanpah received a $1.6 billion loan, guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Energy and funded by the Federal Financing Bank, a branch of the U.S. Treasury. In addition, Ivanpah has received a total equity commitment of $598 million, consisting of $300 million from the lead equity investor, NRG Solar, $168 million from Google, and $130 million from us. A portion of our equity commitment was funded by a $20 million loan from Bechtel. Our ongoing obligations related to Ivanpah, including solar field guarantees and cost overrun funding, are described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Post-Ivanpah Closing Contractual Obligations.”
While Ivanpah has fully committed financing, executing on our pipeline and expanding our business requires significant additional capital. Once both Ivanpah and the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project are operational, we expect to be able to access the traditional project finance and capital markets to both develop and construct future projects.
We currently have three sites in advanced development, Rio Mesa Solar and Hidden Hills Ranch, each located in California, and Sandy Valley, located in Nevada. Rio Mesa Solar consists of approximately 5,800 acres, Hidden Hills Ranch consists of approximately 3,300 acres, and Sandy Valley consists of approximately 10,000 acres. In August and October 2011, we filed Applications for Certification with the California Energy Commission for the development of two 250 MW solar power plants at Hidden Hills Ranch and three 250 MW solar power plants at Rio Mesa Solar, respectively. In October 2011 and December 2011, respectively, the California Energy Commission found our Hidden Hills Ranch and Rio Mesa Solar Applications for Certification to be data adequate. If approved, construction of the plants is expected to be complete in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The electricity generated by the two plants at Hidden Hills Ranch and by two plants at Rio Mesa Solar will be sold to PG&E and SCE, respectively, pursuant to four of the 10 PPAs. The third proposed plant at Rio Mesa Solar is currently unassigned and can be used to satisfy one of our existing PPAs or a future PPA. In January 2012, we entered into two master service agreements for engineering and home office services for Hidden Hills Ranch and Rio Mesa Solar. We are developing the other sites in our 90,000 acre portfolio and working to identify new sites with attractive characteristics for utility-scale solar thermal power plants. In addition, we are actively working to secure additional PPAs, which we intend to match with sites in our portfolio.
In addition to executing on our existing pipeline of PPAs in the United States, we are focused on identifying additional opportunities to sell our systems in targeted international and domestic markets. We are partnering with Alstom, as well as others, on bids for projects in selected international markets, such as the Middle East, Northern Africa, South Africa, Southern Europe, India and Australia. For example, in March 2011, we jointly submitted a bid with Alstom in response to a tender process conducted by the State of Israel for a 110 MW solar thermal power plant near Ashalim, Israel. In
 
89
Table of Contents

September 2011, the tender committee advised us that the bid had passed the minimum threshold requirements but was provisionally rejected due to the pricing. In January 2012, the tender committee invited us to submit an updated bid at a target electricity price set by the committee. A few commercial issues are now being negotiated with the tender committee. In South Africa, we recently entered into an agreement with Sasol to conduct a comprehensive front-end engineering and design study for a potential project in South Africa utilizing our technology. Our partner in South Africa, Alstom, is a subcontractor to us for a significant portion of that engineering study, which we expect to complete by the end of 2012.
In other target markets, such as China, we have not formalized any strategic partnerships, but expect that successful entry into those markets will require alignment with both private companies as well as government bodies. To better identify project opportunities, as well as develop and strengthen ties to existing and potential partners, we have opened offices and deployed dedicated resources in South Africa and Australia. As part of business development activities in our targeted international markets, we expect to augment existing in-country resources, as well as add BrightSource personnel in other international markets.
We also intend to pursue additional opportunities for the development of large scale thermal EOR projects using our systems globally. Our Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project in California developed in partnership with Chevron represents our first thermal EOR project and began operations in October 2011. We believe that solar-to-steam applications of our systems, such as thermal EOR, represent a significant growth opportunity globally.
Our Technology
Our proprietary solar-to-steam system integrates with conventional power block components to deliver cost-competitive, reliable and clean power to utilities when needed most. Our system utilizes fields of heliostats controlled by our proprietary software to concentrate sunlight onto a solar receiver/boiler unit to produce high-temperature steam. This high-temperature steam can be used in the production of electricity or for solar-to-steam applications such as thermal EOR. Our heliostats are strategically arranged around a central tower using our proprietary solar field optimization algorithms that position the heliostats to maximize project-specific revenue generation. The solar receiver is a utility-scale boiler, designed to be heated from the outside using concentrated solar radiation reflected onto the boiler by the heliostats. From the solar receiver, high-temperature, pressurized steam is then piped to a conventional steam turbine generator that produces electricity. The electricity is delivered to utility customers through a connection to the transmission grid. The steam is air-cooled and piped back into the feedwater loop through a process that uses significantly less water than solar thermal plants that use wet-cooling systems.

The diagram below shows the key components of a solar thermal power plant using our system.
 LOGO
The foundation of our technology is our solar field optimization software and proprietary control system that together maximize energy output from our system to match the needs of utilities and industrial process companies. Other key components of our system include heliostats and a solar receiver.
Solar Field Optimization Software
Our proprietary solar field optimization software is used during the system design phase to determine the optimal position of each heliostat to achieve each customer’s power production profile. The software runs comprehensive simulations of year-round operation based on actual site conditions (including physical obstacles and no-build zones) combined with custom-built meteorological datasets, and produces precise GPS-ready mappings ready for download to solar field installation crews. This technology provides considerable design flexibility in supporting irregular site footprints and topographies, allowing projects to be built on sites of nearly any geometric shape.
Control System
Our advanced proprietary software system, the Solar Field Integrated Control System, or SFINCS, controls the heliostats arrayed in the solar field to track the sun. SFINCS performs a number of functions including:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Solar energy management, to focus the ideal amount of solar energy on the receiver at various times of the day to maximize electricity production while ensuring that the solar receiver’s flux and temperature limits are not exceeded.

 
91
Table of Contents

 	Ÿ	 	
Solar field control, to provide aiming points on the solar receiver surface for each individual heliostat, as well as facilitating start-up and shutdown.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Heliostat tracking maintenance, to calibrate the heliostats based on three-dimensional laser scanning and other photogrammetric methods.

At the core of the SFINCS are our proprietary algorithms that perform real-time optimization of the distribution of energy across our solar receiver using real-time, heliostat-aiming and closed-loop feedback systems. In addition, SFINCS can automatically configure the heliostats to protect them from inclement weather and other stresses.
Heliostats
Our tracking mirrors, known as heliostats, are highly engineered and designed for accuracy, durability and longevity with minimal maintenance. Our current generation heliostat consists of two flat, low-iron, float-glass mirrors, each borne by a lightweight steel support structure, mounted on a single pylon that also features a computer-controlled drive system that enables the heliostat to track the sun to an aiming point on the solar receiver. In the current system design, a 130 MW plant will utilize up to 60,000 heliostats, depending on land area and shape, and site-specific economic optimization. The low-impact design of the heliostat allows our sites to include a slope of up to 5%, and avoids most of the costs of leveling and grading a site. Moreover, most desert vegetation can remain undisturbed, which is particularly important in environmentally sensitive areas.

Solar Receiver (Boiler)
The solar receiver is a utility-scale industrial boiler designed to be heated from the outside using concentrated solar radiation reflected onto the boiler by the heliostats. The current design for use in our projects is that of a standard forced-recirculation, drum-type boiler with superheater and reheater. Our solar receiver is designed and manufactured to our specifications by qualified boiler manufacturers. The boiler is designed to withstand the rigors of the daily cycling required in a solar power plant over the course of its lifetime, and is treated with a proprietary solar-absorptive coating to ensure that maximal solar energy is absorbed in the steam.
In electricity generation applications, the high-temperature, pressurized steam generated in the solar receiver is piped to a conventional steam turbine generator. The electricity generated is then delivered to the transmission grid for consumption. The steam is air-cooled and recirculated. By using dry cooling, we believe our system consumes over 90% less water when compared to a similar plant using a wet-cooling system. We believe this process represents an important design element of our system since projects using our systems are likely to be located in arid or desert locations.

In a solar-to-steam application, such as thermal EOR, the process is generally the same as for generating electricity. However, for solar-to-steam applications, saturated steam can be piped from the receiver, which typically will not have a superheater, to generate the process steam. Solar-to-steam applications frequently require lower temperatures and pressures compared to electricity generation.
Hybridization
Our system design allows for integration with natural gas or other fossil fuels, referred to as hybridization, to enable increased output and more reliable production of electricity. There are three levels of hybridization as described below. The decision to integrate hybridization in our systems, and at what level, is made on a project-by-project basis depending on analysis of the net economic impact to the project, and to the utility’s power grid, and local and national regulations. For example, California’s Renewable Portfolio Standard applies a cap to the amount of energy that can be produced by qualifying renewable resources through co-firing of fossil fuels, which resulted in an optimal design selection of hybridization for supplemental production at Ivanpah. For future projects, we may choose to increase the level of hybridization subject to specific project contracts and regulations.
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Hybridization for Supplemental Production:    We use a minimal amount of natural gas, in accordance with national and local regulations, to improve the reliability of electricity production throughout the day. For example, each of the three Ivanpah plants will be equipped with a small auxiliary gas-fired boiler that assists with daily start-up, provides steam during short periods of cloud cover, and produces additional electricity when solar radiation declines during the late afternoon. These small boilers will typically be called upon to produce the equivalent of 2% to 5% of the total electricity output of each project.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Hybridization for Extended Production:    We are currently engineering a project design with larger gas-fired boilers that can provide as much as 50% of a plant’s power rating. In addition to adding reliability (to an even greater degree than the smaller boilers at Ivanpah), these boilers can provide higher on-peak availability, and add dispatchability capabilities that can help utilities and grid operators avoid having to invest in other, more expensive solutions to ensure long-term reliability and operational flexibility, such as construction and operation of additional gas turbines. The boilers are planned to produce at least 5% of each project’s annual electricity production, and in some cases could be used to produce an additional 5% to 10% of the plant’s annual electricity production when deployed as dispatchable capacity.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Complete Hybridization:    In markets where there are available solar resources, we can offer three unique solar thermal power plant configurations for customer specific applications:

 
 	•	 	
Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC)—A fully optimized natural gas combined cycle plant integrating our power tower and solar field technology, optimized across turbines and steam generators.

 
 	•	 	
Solar Hybrid Add-On, also known as Steam Tail, which includes the retrofit of a single-cycle power plant into a combined-cycle power plant, plus the addition of our power tower and solar field technology.

 
 	•	 	
Solar Boost—Integration of our power tower and solar field technology into the water/steam cycle of a fossil fuel power plant.

For the above configurations, this allows a power plant to operate as a baseload power source while significantly reducing fossil fuel consumption, air pollutants and other regulated emissions.

Storage
Our solar power tower technology has the capability to use existing cost-effective thermal energy storage in the form of molten salts to augment electricity production late in the day, improve the reliability of electricity delivery, shape our daily power supply curve and potentially serve the market for services such as regulating reserve and load following. Storage also allows electric power plants using our systems to supply electricity for more hours per year and shift electricity generation to critical hours with higher energy prices. Our technology roadmap includes the development of a solution to deliver up to six hours per day of molten salt storage. We recently announced the launch of a new solar thermal plant solution called SolarPLUS, which combines our solar power tower technology with two-tank molten-salt storage capabilities. In such a system, heat from excess steam is stored in a blend of molten nitrate salts (sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate) until the storage system is discharged by reversing the flow of the system and steam is generated from the heat stored in the salts. In October 2011, we executed amendments to five PPAs, three of which provide for the utilization of our SolarPLUS solar thermal plant solution.
Solar Energy Development Center
In June 2008, we opened the Solar Energy Development Center, or SEDC, a fully operational 6 MWth demonstration solar-to-steam facility used to test equipment, materials and procedures as well as construction and operating methods. The SEDC is a scaled cross-section of a typical commercial plant and serves to demonstrate the same proprietary technology that will be used for utility-scale projects that use our technology. An independent engineering firm tested and verified the SEDC’s ability to produce high-temperature and high-pressure solar steam, which we believe are the world’s highest. In a full-sized commercial plant, this utility-grade superheated steam is piped from the boiler to a standard turbine to generate electricity. The SEDC power tower and surrounding heliostats concentrate the sun’s energy onto the boiler, heating the water inside up to 540°C, or more than 1,000°F. The SEDC plant includes more than 1,600 heliostats and a 60 meter tower topped by a solar boiler. The SEDC is located in the Rotem Industrial Park in Israel’s Negev Desert, about 100 km (60 miles) southeast of Jerusalem.
Suppliers
We generally obtain components for our solar thermal systems from multiple suppliers. Because of lead times, we currently source some of our key components for Ivanpah from a limited or sole source of supply, including boilers from Riley Power and turbines from Siemens.
Customers
We sell our systems into utility-scale solar thermal power projects either directly to project owners or indirectly as a sub-supplier to the contractor providing engineering, procurement and construction services to project owners. In conjunction with these sales, we provide technical services related to the design, engineering and operation of our systems. We also sell our systems and technology to oil production companies pursuing thermal EOR activities. In 2011, Ivanpah and Chevron represented the vast majority of our revenue.
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)
Power purchase agreements are contracts that provide for the purchase of power at an agreed-upon price for a period of time, which is typically 20 to 25 years for solar projects. Through our project companies, we have 13 executed and outstanding PPAs to deliver approximately 2.4 GW of installed capacity with two of the largest electric utilities in the United States. Ivanpah will fulfill the commitments under two of the PG&E PPAs and one of the SCE PPAs, and we retain 10 PPAs to deliver approximately 2.0 GW of installed capacity.
 
94
Table of Contents

We believe these PPAs constitute one of the largest utility-scale solar pipelines in the United States.
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E):    In April 2008, we entered into five PPAs with PG&E to deliver 900 MW of installed capacity. In April 2009, we signed two additional PPAs with PG&E, increasing the total contracted installed capacity to 1,310 MW. All seven PPAs have been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC. Two of the PPAs have been assigned to Ivanpah, and the contracted capacity under the remaining five PPAs is now 1,000 MW. Each PPA provides that PG&E will purchase the full output of an individual power plant for a period of 25 years, and specifies a commercial operation date, or COD, for the power plant (the earliest in 2013, and the latest in 2017). Based in San Francisco, California, PG&E is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, serving approximately 15 million customers in Northern and Central California.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Southern California Edison (SCE):    In February 2009, we entered into seven PPAs with SCE to deliver 1,300 MW of installed capacity, one of which was assigned to Ivanpah. In October 2011, we amended and restated five of the PPAs to deliver 1,000 MW of installed capacity. These PPAs were submitted to the CPUC for approval in November 2011. In conjunction with these amendments, the one remaining PPA was consolidated such that the combined expected annual energy production of the five remaining PPAs approximates the combined expected annual energy production of the original six PPAs. Three of the five PPAs provide for utilization of our SolarPLUS solar thermal power plant solution. Each PPA provides that SCE will purchase the full output of an individual power plant for a period of 20 years (or 25 years, at SCE’s option), and specifies COD for the power plant (the earliest in 2015, and the latest in 2017). SCE is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, serving nearly 14 million customers in Central, Coastal and Southern California.

Research and Development
We engage in extensive research and development efforts to improve solar efficiency and reduce system costs and complexity to maintain our competitive advantage. Our research and development organization, consisting of 293 employees located in Israel as of December 31, 2011, works closely with our third-party equipment and service providers and our customers to improve our solar thermal technology and reduce costs. Our research and development expenditures were approximately, $9.7 million in 2009, $8.6 million in 2010 and $17.6 million in 2011.
Intellectual Property
We have developed our own proprietary intellectual property relating to the design, construction and operation of our solar thermal technology and systems. We primarily rely on trade secret and contractual rights, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary information and know-how. We also maintain a growing patent portfolio that as of February 29, 2012 consisted of nine issued U.S. patents (including one patent covering dynamic system optimization and another covering integration of solar thermal systems and PV, both of which were issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the second half of 2011, and one patent covering heliostat design), Which expire between January 2023 and August 2028. We also maintain numerous patent applications, which included on the above date 11 patent applications covering control systems and solar field optimization software, six patent applications covering our operating methods, seven patent applications covering heliostat and receiver design, and three patent applications covering thermal energy storage. Our patent strategy is to invest the resources necessary to protect our value-added development and to obtain, to the extent possible, broad and meaningful patent coverage for systems using our technology.

Competition
We compete in the utility-scale power and thermal EOR markets. Within the utility-scale power market, we believe that our principal competitors are companies developing renewable energy solutions, such as solar thermal, PV (such as crystalline silicon, thin film and CPV) and wind technologies. In addition, we compete with companies using conventional fossil fuels to generate electricity. Within the utility-scale renewable energy market, the principal factors upon which we compete are:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
total system cost to utility (including power price and system integration cost)

 
 	Ÿ	 	
efficiency (energy output)

 
 	Ÿ	 	
reliability (delivering power on a continuous basis throughout the day and into peak hours)

 
 	Ÿ	 	
operational flexibility (including performance and peak demand availability)

 
 	Ÿ	 	
net system cost to utility (including energy and capacity benefits)

We believe we compete favorably on each of these factors.
Within the EOR market, we compete with companies utilizing thermal recovery processes. Within the thermal EOR market, the principal factors upon which we compete are price, performance and environmental attributes.
Many of our competitors within the broader energy and renewable energy sector have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than us. In addition, we expect to compete with future entrants to the solar thermal industry that offer new technological solutions.
Regulatory Matters
In the United States, our project companies and third-party projects that use our solar thermal technology are subject to extensive regulation by various federal, state and local government agencies. The federal government regulates the wholesale sale and transmission of electric power in interstate commerce through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, and regulates environmental matters through a variety of agencies. States and local governments regulate the construction of electricity generation, steam generation and electricity transmission facilities, the intrastate distribution of electricity, retail electricity sales and certain environmental matters through various agencies. Similar national, regional and local regulatory frameworks apply in other countries, and multinational confederation frameworks may also apply, as in the European Union. Our project companies active in other countries would be required to comply with the energy, environmental and permitting requirements applicable in the locations in which the projects are sited. Our intent outside the United States is to sell our solar thermal technology into third-party-developed projects as opposed to leading project development activities. We expect to work closely with our partners to comply with local market regulations.
U.S. Federal Regulation
Our project companies for electricity generation projects qualify as exempt wholesale generators, or EWGs, through the self-certification procedures contained in FERC regulations. EWGs are entities that engage exclusively in the business of owning generating facilities selling the resulting electric energy products in wholesale markets, and thus qualify for exemption from FERC’s books and records
 
96
Table of Contents

regulations under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Our electricity generation project companies will sell electric capacity, energy and ancillary services at market-based rates upon application for, and receipt of, authority granted by FERC.
Our electricity generation project companies are also subject to the reliability standards and operating procedures of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, and to regional and local requirements (noted below). If our project companies fail to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, our project companies could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.
Due to the height of some of our solar power towers and their potential effect on aviation, our project companies are also required under certain circumstances to seek approval from the Federal Aviation Administration and/or to consult with the Department of Defense.
U.S. Regional and State Regulation
In addition to the reliability requirements of the NERC, our electricity generation project companies are required to comply with the regional reliability requirements of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, or WECC, as well as standards that may be applied by other balancing area authorities in which our projects may be located, such as those of the California Independent System Operator Corporation, or CAISO. If our electricity generation project companies fail to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, our project companies could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.
The California Energy Commission is responsible for permitting the construction and operation of certain electric power plants located in California, including those using our systems, and provides comprehensive certification of such projects, which include all state environmental permits. For solar-to-steam projects in California, county building permits and separate environmental permits are required. Projects outside California may require building permits and separate environmental permits, including for air emissions and any potential impact on wildlife species.
State public utilities commissions, such as the CPUC, the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada and the Arizona Corporation Commission regulate public utility companies operating in their respective states and establish rates, tariffs, charges and fees, as well approve power purchase agreements between our electricity generation project companies and utilities under their jurisdiction. These commissions are generally responsible for overseeing renewables procurement obligations. These commissions are also responsible for permitting the construction of transmission within their respective states; while in California the CPUC’s jurisdiction is exclusive, except where transmission is provided by a municipal or other publicly-owned utility, in other states, such as Nevada, local approvals may also be required.
Environmental Regulation
Our project companies are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations require our project companies to obtain and maintain permits and approvals, undergo environmental review processes and implement environmental, health and safety programs and procedures to control risks associated with the siting, construction, operation and decommissioning of their projects, all of which involve a significant investment of time and expense.
Under U.S. laws and regulations such as the Federal Clean Air Act, Federal Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act and endangered species requirements, U.S. Bureau of Land

Management, or BLM, requirements and other state and local programs, our project companies are required to obtain a range of environmental permits and other approvals from federal, state and local governmental authorities to build and operate the projects. For example, the activities of our project companies are regulated by various federal environmental and natural resource agencies including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (on wetland and certain water issues); the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, (on air quality, storm water, wetland and certain other issues); the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (on wildlife species issues); and the BLM (in relation to its management of federal lands on which our sites may be located, or through which generator tie-lines may transverse). Our project companies incur costs in the ordinary course of business to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements may result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may be brought alleging environmental and other impacts from our projects. See “Business — Legal Proceedings.’’
Governmental Programs and Incentives
One of the key factors contributing to the growth of solar power and other sources of renewable energy in the United States is the existence of several government incentive programs and regulatory requirements at both the state and federal level.
Renewable Portfolio Standards
A Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS (sometimes called a Renewable Energy Standard, or RES), is a program mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales in a state or municipality originate from eligible sources of renewable energy. In the United States, over half of the states, including our initial target markets in California and the U.S. Southwest, have implemented ambitious RPS programs that require retail electricity suppliers to provide a minimum percentage of their retail supply from eligible sources of renewable energy. State RPS requirements have been a major driver of renewable energy growth in the United States. Of the 30 GW of non-hydro renewable capacity added since 2004, 90% has been built in states with established, legally binding RPS requirements, according to Emerging Energy Research. State climate change programs, such as California’s Global Warming Solutions Act (known as AB 32), incorporate existing RPS requirements for electricity, which help create the market for electric power plants using our systems, as well as carbon-reduction requirements for other sectors, which facilitate a market for our solar-to-steam projects.
In addition to state RPS programs, federal legislation to establish a national clean and/or renewable energy standard remains in consideration. Several such bills have been introduced in the House and Senate in recent years and there has also been discussion of a Clean Energy Standard, or CES, which would include renewables along with other low- or no-carbon energy sources, such as hydro, clean coal and nuclear. Interstate electrical transmission planning to support the timely development of renewable energy projects has been a central focus of proposed federal legislation and Department of Energy and FERC rules. Federal and state regulators are working together to implement renewable generation and transmission, and will need to increase their efforts in the event of adoption of a federal renewables generation program and/or a federal program for renewable transmission.
California and the U.S. Southwest states that our project companies are targeting have mandatory RPS policies and in some cases, specific set-asides for solar projects. California has recently adopted legislation requiring all California retail energy sellers, including municipal power agencies, to derive 33% of the energy they supply from renewable energy resources by 2020. In the U.S. Southwest, Nevada’s
 
98
Table of Contents

RPS requires 25% of total electric generation to come from eligible sources of renewable energy by 2025, Arizona’s RPS requires 15% by 2025, and New Mexico requires 20% by 2020 for investor-owned utilities and 10% by 2020 for utility cooperatives. Given this region’s energy needs, demand characteristics and renewable energy resources, we believe that the majority of the electrical power supplied from renewable energy projects built in response to RPS mandates in this region will be in the form of solar energy. In addition to RPS programs, some states have technology-specific requirements, such as New Mexico’s mandate that a minimum of 20% of the total RPS requirement applicable to investor-owned utilities must come from solar energy sources (i.e., 4% of retail sales must be from solar energy resources). The RPS programs and supplemental requirements in these states require additional renewable energy development in order for the RPS program requirements to be achieved, and thus present significant growth opportunities for solar power development.
U.S. Federal Tax and Economic Incentives
The U.S. Government provides multiple programs that significantly encourage investment in the renewable energy sector, promote the development of domestic clean-energy jobs and act as an engine of economic growth. President Obama has demonstrated consistent support for growing the renewable energy industry, including the 2011 State of the Union address in which he stated his intent to pursue a Clean Energy Standard and established the goal of obtaining 80% of U.S. electricity from clean energy sources by 2035.
Extensive U.S. Government support creates compelling incentives for companies to finance and build new utility-scale renewable energy projects in the United States. Certain of these initiatives include:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Investment tax credits:    The investment tax credit for solar energy projects. The ITC was increased from 10% to 30% and was extended through December 2016. Eligibility for a cash grant in lieu of this investment tax credit is currently limited to projects that had commenced construction by the end of 2011. While a one-year extension of the project commencement deadline was included in President Obama’s fiscal year 2013 budget proposal – and there are active industry-wide efforts seeking to extend the cash grant – there are no assurances that an extension will be successfully signed into law.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Accelerated depreciation:    Allowing accelerated depreciation of capital costs over five years for solar projects placed in service after 1986.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Bonus depreciation:    The ability to claim an additional depreciation deduction equal to 50% of the capital expenditures of a project immediately for projects completed during 2009 and on some equipment installed in 2010. In December 2010, Congress extended this program to allow eligible property placed in service after September 8, 2010 and before January 1, 2012 to qualify for 100% first-year bonus depreciation. For 2012, bonus depreciation is still available, but the allowable deduction reverts from 100% to 50% of the eligible basis.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
DOE loan guarantee program:    Providing DOE Title XVII loan guarantees of up to 80% of the cost of a renewable energy project that utilizes new technology, and in some circumstances, providing direct loans funded by the Federal Financing Bank. We were one of the few technology companies selected for the DOE’s Title XVII loan guarantee program, and the only solar thermal technology company included in the first phase of that program. As part of the program, Ivanpah received a $1.6 billion loan, guaranteed by the DOE and funded by the Federal Financing Bank, a branch of the U.S. Treasury, which closed in April 2011. Although the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded the DOE loan guarantee program to $6 billion and was estimated to provide at least $60 to $80 billion of financing for the industry, funding for this program has been substantially reduced to $2.5 billion and continues to face challenges. The DOE loan guarantee program currently has limited unallocated funds

and loan authority. It is uncertain when the DOE will issue another solicitation for new loan guarantee applications. In connection with its review of the DOE loan guarantee program, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives has requested that all beneficiaries of DOE-based loan guarantees produce copies of communications between each company and the DOE. We are currently in the process of responding to this request.

International Governmental Programs
Outside of the U.S., several key target markets for us including South Africa, Australia, China and India have also implemented specific solar targets, often coupled with financial incentives such as feed-in tariffs. For example:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
China: As part of the coordination around the 12th Five Year Plan, the Chinese government is targeting the addition of 50 GW of solar capacity by 2020, which is being pursued in coordination with a national goal to obtain 15% of all energy generated in 2020 from renewable sources.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
India: India has initiated the National Solar Mission bidding program with an ultimate target to procure 20 GW of solar power by 2022, which will be a large part of fulfilling their 15% by 2020 RPS target.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
South Africa: South Africa, through its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) promulgated in 2010, targets 18 GW of renewable energy capacity (including 9 GW of solar energy) by 2030, or 11% of total installed capacity, and has recently announced a government-sponsored bidding program with a feed-in tariff for the first 3,725 MW of renewable energy contemplated under the IRP.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Australia: Australia has implemented initiatives to decrease fossil fuel use in power and increase the use of renewable energy, including a 20% by 2020 RPS program, as well as a carbon tax which was ratified in 2011 and will be implemented in July of 2012.

Employees
As of December 31, 2011, we employed 365 full-time employees and 47 part-time employees, including 272 engaged primarily in research, development and operations activities, and 140 in administrative activities. Of these employees, 117 full-time employees and one part-time employee are located in the United States, primarily in Oakland, California, and 248 full-time and 46 part-time employees are located outside the United States, primarily in Jerusalem, Israel. As of December 31, 2011, we also employed (directly or through third-party agencies) 34 individuals on a contract basis (29 on a full-time basis), 18 of whom were primarily engaged in research, development and operations activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Legal Proceedings
On January 13, 2011, the La Cuna De Aztlan Sacred Sites Protection Circle Advisory Committee, Californians for Renewable Energy, and seven individuals filed a complaint in the United States District Court, Central District of California, alleging that the permitting process for the four large scale solar projects on federal land in California subject to that court’s jurisdiction, including Ivanpah, did not comply with various federal requirements. The original complaint named the U.S. Department of Interior, or DOI, the project companies holding permits for Ivanpah and permit-holding developers of other projects as defendants. The complaint was amended on August 5, 2011 to add new defendants, including the DOE, Federal Financing Bank and U.S. Treasury Department, and to add additional
 
100
Table of Contents

claims. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, but no motion for injunctive relief has been filed in the suit against Ivanpah. A summary judgment hearing is scheduled for August 2012 and trial on any remaining issues is to begin in January 2013.
On January 14, 2011, the Western Watersheds Project filed a complaint in the United States District Court, Central District of California, against the DOI also alleging that the permitting process for Ivanpah did not comply with various federal requirements. Subsequently, we intervened as a defendant in the case. On August 10, 2011, the District Court denied a preliminary injunction motion filed by the Western Watersheds Project, which plaintiff appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 30, 2011, the Ninth Circuit denied plaintiff’s request for an injunction pending appeal. A summary judgment hearing was held in the District Court in January 2012.
We believe the lawsuits will not succeed on the merits, and that the likelihood of an injunction materially impairing the project is increasingly small with the passage of time. Nonetheless, litigation, whether or not determined in our favor, can be costly and time consuming and could divert our attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.
We are not currently a party to any other material litigation. Our industry is subject to extensive and rapidly changing federal, state and local electricity, environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations. We may from time to time become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings contesting our permits or the construction or operation of our projects.
Facilities
Our principal executive offices are located in Oakland, California, where we lease approximately 30,000 square feet under leases that expire in December 2013 and June 2014. In addition, we lease approximately 67,000 square feet in Jerusalem, Israel, for our research and development organization under five leases that expire between May 2013 and December 2015 and approximately 775,000 square feet of demonstration facility and test site space under two leases, the terms of which are currently being extended. We also lease office space in various geographic locations. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs through the middle of 2014, at which time we may need to lease additional space.
We have an approximately 90,000 acre development site portfolio under our control in California and the U.S. Southwest. The development site portfolio is comprised of land in which we, directly or through our project companies, hold options to lease (private land), leasehold interests and rights to lease (public land), including “right-of-way” grants from the BLM. We do not currently own or lease any land that we consider to be materially important physical properties.

Director Independence
Upon the completion of this offering, our common stock will be listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company’s board of directors within a specified period of the completion of this offering. In addition, the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating and governance committees be independent. Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of that company’s board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
In order to be considered to be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.
In March 2012, our board of directors undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that none of Messrs. Brathwaite, Dolezalek, O’Flynn, Eats, Fries and Kelly, representing six of our nine directors, has a relationship that would
 
107

interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is “independent” as that term is defined under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.

Dolezalek, Eats and Brathwaite, who comprise our compensation committee and Messrs. O’Flynn, Kelly and Fries, who comprise our nominating and governance committee, satisfy the independence standards for those committees established by applicable SEC rules and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for the year ended December 31, 2011 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below.
This discussion contains information regarding our executive compensation programs that are based on our current plans and historical practices, as well as considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs that we may adopt as we evolve from a pre-IPO company to a publicly traded company. While we have endeavored to include statements about how our compensation programs may evolve in a post-IPO environment based upon our current expectations, the actual compensation programs that we ultimately adopt may differ materially from currently planned programs summarized in this discussion.
Named Executive Officers
The individuals in the Summary Compensation Table set forth after this Compensation Discussion and Analysis are referred to as the “named executive officers,” or NEOs, and include the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the three other most highly compensated executive officers. Our NEOs also include a former executive officer who would have been one of the most highly compensated executive officers had he remained an executive officer through December 31, 2011. Our NEOs for 2011 were:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
John Woolard – President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Jack Jenkins-Stark – Chief Financial Officer

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Joseph Desmond – Senior Vice President of Government Affairs and Communications

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Israel Kroizer – Executive Vice President of R&D and Product Supply BSE/ President BSII

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Stephen Wiley – Senior Vice President of U.S. Development

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Carlos Aguilar – formerly the Senior Vice President of Project Execution and International Development

Role of the Compensation Committee in Setting Executive Compensation
The compensation committee has the overall responsibility for assessing performance and recommending to our board of directors the compensation and benefits of our NEOs. In addition, the compensation committee reviews and approves the short- and long-term incentive strategy and plans.
Members of the compensation committee are appointed by the board of directors. Mr. Eats served on the compensation committee for the entire calendar year 2011. During calendar year 2011, the following changes were made to the compensation committee: (1) Mr. Dolezalek replaced Mr. Fries on May 4, 2011 and is currently the Committee Chair; (2) Mr. Bryson resigned effective June 27, 2011 upon his nomination to be the U.S. Secretary of Commerce; and (3) Mr. Brathwaite was appointed on August 16, 2011 to replace Mr. Bryson.
None of the compensation committee members are executive officers of the Company. Messrs. Brathwaite, Eats, and Dolezalek are, and at all times of service during calendar year 2011 were, independent directors as defined under the NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules. Mr. Bryson was an independent director during his time of service during calendar year 2011.

Role of Compensation Consultant
During 2011, the compensation committee retained Aon Hewitt as its outside consultant to assist the compensation committee as part of its decision-making process with regard to executive compensation related matters. Aon Hewitt provided no services directly for management with regard to executive compensation or other matters.
Role of Chief Executive Officer in Compensation Decisions
For executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the compensation committee has sought input from our Chief Executive Officer and our Human Resources department regarding executive officers’ responsibilities, performance and compensation levels. The Chief Executive Officer, often in conjunction with analyses prepared by the Human Resources department and outside consultants, recommends base salary increases, bonus awards and equity award levels and advises the compensation committee regarding the compensation program’s ability to attract, motivate and retain executive talent. Specific analyses relied upon by the Chief Executive Officer in making such recommendations are referenced in the subsequent sections discussing the specific compensation actions taken during calendar year 2011.
The compensation committee considers the Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations, but may adjust pay up or down at its discretion, and approves the specific compensation for all the executive officers. Our compensation committee relies on the experience of our directors, who serve in both public and private companies, to determine and approve compensation. Our compensation committee meets in executive sessions, and our Chief Executive Officer does not attend discussions where recommendations are made or discussed regarding his compensation.
Compensation Philosophy
Our compensation philosophy supports our mission, values and goals, and recognizes that our employees are vital to our success. BrightSource’s objective is to provide fair, attractive, competitive, and flexible total compensation that allows us to attract, motivate, and retain exceptionally talented executives and employees. We seek executives and employees who have the skills and abilities needed to achieve desired business results, and who perform in alignment with our core values of integrity, ethics, safety, and industry leadership. We are a company that strives to perform and compete among the top of our industry peers, and we set our compensation levels accordingly.
The Company seeks the best available sources of external pay data to benchmark compensation in our target labor market, recognizing that competitive pay levels can differ by geography, role, or other market characteristics. After considering external reference data, the Company exercises judgment in setting what we believe is appropriately competitive compensation.
For senior roles, the Company generally intends to place a higher proportion of pay at risk, tied to measurable performance metrics aligned with key financial and operational benchmarks. Likewise, the mix of compensation and relative market positioning may vary by functional area and general market practices.

Compensation Data and Comparator Group
The Company uses several data sources for the competitive compensation benchmarking of its executives in the United States and Israel.
Throughout the year, the compensation committee met with and made requests of Aon Hewitt with respect to comparator data. Beginning in March 2011, Aon Hewitt, in conjunction with Company management and under the compensation committee’s review and input, conducted an analysis of the Company’s compensation benchmarking peers for executive talent. Aon Hewitt conducted several market screens to identify a preliminary peer group. The pool of companies considered and subsequent screens incorporated the following:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Existing BrightSource peer group companies;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Companies identified by the Company’s investment bankers as comparable with a similar business model or industry focus;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Solar-related, energy, independent power producers, heavy electrical equipment, utilities, multi-utilities, environmental and facilities services, construction and engineering and semiconductor (solar-related) companies; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Companies with market capitalizations generally between $750 million to $3 billion and revenues between $200 million and $2 billion.

The compensation committee selected the following companies as a peer group to use as reference for benchmarking executive and Board compensation and benefits:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
A123 Systems, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
American Superconductor Corporation

 	Ÿ	 	
Argan, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Atlantic Power Corporation

 	Ÿ	 	
Michael Baker Corporation

 	Ÿ	 	
Broadwind Energy, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Calpine Corporation

 	Ÿ	 	
Emcore Corporation

 	Ÿ	 	
Energy Conversion Devices, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Finisar Corporation

 	Ÿ	 	
First Solar, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
GT Solar International, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
MYR Group, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Ormat Technologies, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Pike Electric Corp.

 	Ÿ	 	
Power-One, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Powersecure International, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Premier Power Renewable Energy

 	Ÿ	 	
Satcon Technology Corp.

 	Ÿ	 	
Solazyme, Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Sunpower Corporation

 	Ÿ	 	
Tesla Motors Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
Tetra Tech Inc.

 	Ÿ	 	
TRC Companies, Inc.

 
115
Table of Contents

In addition, the Company referenced compensation benchmarking data for pre-IPO, technology and power industry firms from the following published survey sources:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Radford High Technology Executive Compensation Survey data for participating U.S.-based companies with $200 million to $500 million in revenue and Radford country-specific compensation data for executive positions based in Israel.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
IEHRA Energy Industry Compensation survey data for non-regulated companies.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Zviran’s Salary Survey, covering compensation at Israeli companies in the high-tech and information technology industries.

We use the above as a “guiding” compensation philosophy given that our industry segment is highly unique. There are few firms that are precisely comparable to us in all aspects of revenue, technology and scope. For this reason we reference compensation data from a variety of sources, including pre-IPO and public high technology, alternative energy and power companies ranging in revenue size and scope. The compensation committee does not use the above data rigidly and uses its discretion and independent judgment when positioning individual executive pay. We will continue to assess and adjust our executive compensation philosophy on a going-forward basis as we transition from being a private to a public company and continue to grow in size of revenues and assets.
Pay Mix
When reviewing the compensation of executive officers vis-a-vis the market data, the compensation committee did generally take into consideration the mix of fixed versus variable compensation. As a previously non-public entity, the Company has not yet adopted a specific policy regarding fixed versus incentive pay due to the variability in the valuation of long-term incentives provided in the form of Company stock options. Going forward, the Company will continue to monitor both BrightSource’s and the competitive market’s fixed and incentive pay levels.
Base Salaries
The compensation committee periodically reviews the salaries of our executives as a group and individually. The factors considered when establishing a base salary for each executive officer include, but are not limited to, the individual’s performance, relevant experience, role, responsibilities and contribution level and external market practices (market data). Base salaries are generally targeted between the median and 75th percentile of the external market.
On March 18, 2011, the compensation committee approved an increase to the base salary for Mr. Woolard, increasing it from $395,000 to $445,000 (12.7%) retroactive to January 1, 2011. This base salary increase was made to reflect the compensation committee’s interpretation of external market data indicating that his base salary was below our desired competitive market positioning, and the continued growth and scale of the Company. More specifically, this competitive market analysis indicated that Mr. Woolard’s base salary of $395,000 was below the 50th percentile ($420,000) for Bay Area public technology/alternative energy companies and also below the 50th percentile ($406,800) for independent power industry companies.
Annual Cash Incentive Program
The 2011 Short-Term Incentive Plan is a discretionary incentive plan that measures both Company and individual performance. The plan was designed to fund a discretionary award pool up to 100% of the target bonus opportunities of our executives for meeting certain individual objectives and the Company’s key corporate objectives, which were as follows:
 
 	1.	achievement of key Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) milestones;
 
116
Table of Contents

 	2.	closing of Ivanpah financing, transition of ownership responsibilities, and ensuring on-budget and on-schedule provision of the BrightSource scope of supply;
 
 	3.	obtaining sufficient operating capital to fund planned growth;
 
 	4.	securing a post-Ivanpah site in the U.S.;
 
 	5.	enhance positioning for future growth through R&D efforts to improve cost/performance;
 
 	6.	strategic initiatives to expand our development footprint internationally; and
 
 	7.	maintaining current revenue streams through PPAs in the U.S. and developing new ones for the future.
Satisfaction of the above goals, together with an evaluation of each NEO’s performance against his or her individual goals, forms the basis upon which the compensation committee intends to exercise its discretion in awarding individual bonuses. The plan is not intended by the compensation committee to be formulaic in nature. Thus, the compensation committee did not pre-establish fixed weighting for individual versus corporate goals or among the corporate goals. Additionally, the compensation committee did not specifically identify threshold levels or maximum levels of performance to trigger payouts.
The Compensation Committee considered an assessment by management and concluded that, overall, management had achieved 65% of its goals for 2011. The following table summarizes the final 2011 annual cash incentive targets and actual bonuses by NEO as determined by the Compensation Committee (with regard to the bonus for the CEO) and by the CEO (with regard to the bonuses for the other NEOs) based on the assessment and its evaluation of individual performance and contribution toward achieving the Company’s goals.
The following table summarizes the potential target bonuses and actual bonuses awarded for each NEO for the 2011 performance year:

(1)	The basis for Mr. Kroizer’s 2011 bonus calculation will be $245,000 to control for the impact of currency exchange fluctuations.
(2)	The target bonus amount for Mr. Desmond is prorated to reflect his partial year of service during 2011.
(3)	The target bonus amount for Mr. Wiley is prorated to reflect his partial year of service during 2011.
(4)	The target bonus amount for Dr. Aguilar is prorated to reflect his partial year of service during 2011.
In addition to the bonuses described above, on April 27, 2011 the compensation committee awarded a one-time gross cash award of $100,000 to Mr. Jenkins-Stark in recognition of his leadership in successfully completing the project financing for our Ivanpah project.
Annual Cash Incentive Program – Post-IPO
The Company’s current short-term incentive plan is a fully discretionary cash bonus plan which will be superseded by the BrightSource Energy, Inc. Short-Term Incentive plan upon the closing of the
 
117
Table of Contents

offering. The BrightSource Energy, Inc. Short-Term Incentive Plan, or the Short-Term Incentive Plan, is in a form consistent with the current plan’s structure with additional provisions to reflect the Company’s status as publicly-traded. On July 2, 2011, the board of directors approved the Short-Term Incentive Plan to become effective upon the closing of the offering. The new Short-Term Incentive Plan will first provide for bonuses for the 2012 plan year and its purpose is to motivate and reward eligible employees for their contributions toward the achievement of certain performance goals, with the intention that the incentives paid thereunder to certain executive officers of the Company are deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code, and the regulations and interpretations promulgated thereunder. The Short-Term Incentive Plan will be administered by the compensation committee, which shall have the discretionary authority to interpret the provisions of the Short-Term Incentive Plan, including all decisions on eligibility to participate, the establishment of performance goals, the amount of awards payable under the plan, and the payment of awards.
Equity Compensation
Stock options are our primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our executives. We believe that equity grants help to align the interests of our executives and stockholders, provide our executives with incentives linked to long-term performance and create an ownership culture. Stock options granted in 2011 have a 10-year term and become vested and exercisable at a rate of 1/5th of the shares on the first anniversary of the grant and 1/60th of the original number of shares at the end of each month thereafter. Select stock option grants prior to 2011 had a different vesting schedule. We believe the vesting schedule of the equity grants contributes to executive retention as the vesting provides an incentive for our executives to remain employed during the period. Prior to this IPO, our executives have been eligible to participate in our 2006 Stock Plan, which will be superseded by the 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan upon the effective date of the offering. Stock options are granted at 100% of fair market value, or FMV, on the date of grant as determined by the compensation committee with the input of an independent valuation by a valuation firm engaged by the Company to perform periodic Internal Revenue Code section 409A valuations of the Company’s stock, applying valuation techniques and methods that rely on recommendations by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, in its Audit and Accounting Practice Aid and conform to generally accepted valuation practices.
Specific equity grants made to the NEOs in 2011 were:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Mr. Desmond: 53,333 stock options granted on September 9, 2011 with respect to his hire by the Company.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Mr. Wiley: 33,333 stock options granted on September 9, 2011 with respect to his hire by the Company.

Following the IPO closing, executives will be eligible to receive long-term incentive awards under the 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan.
Stock Option Grant Practices
The compensation committee approves all equity grants that are made to any executive officer of the Company, including the NEOs. Initial grants to executives have typically been made upon their hire, and in some cases subsequent grants have been made to reward performance, to provide additional retention incentives or to better align the executive’s compensation with target market compensation levels. Going forward following the IPO, our general intent is to provide annual refresh grants to executives based upon performance, retention need, and prevalent market compensation practices.
 
118
Table of Contents

In the past, we have not granted stock options on a focal grant date. Post-IPO, we intend to grant long-term incentive equity on a common annual date, effective after any material non-public information (such as our earnings) has been released to the public.
In addition, we are in the process of determining whether to use other forms of long-term incentive awards (e.g., cash-based and other stock vehicles) as part of our long-term incentive mix going forward.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Company does not currently have formal stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers because we believe our current incentive compensation arrangements provide the appropriate alignment between executive officers and our stockholders. We will continue to review best practices and evaluate our position with respect to stock ownership guidelines.
Employee Benefits
Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the benefit programs that are generally available to all of the Company’s employees in their respective country (United States or Israel) of employment. Other than any contractual individual arrangements described in the sections titled “—Employment Agreements and Offer Letters” and “—Severance and Change in Control Agreements,” including providing Messrs. Woolard and Jenkins-Stark with annuity contracts and a parking allowance, and Mr. Kroizer with vehicle expense reimbursement, the Company does not provide any supplemental executive benefits to NEOs.
Severance Agreements with Executive Officers
The compensation committee has approved severance and change in control agreements for each of our executive officers in order to provide reasonable protection when a change in control could affect their security, authority or compensation. This also promotes the interests of stockholders by mitigating executives’ concerns about such personal matters and thereby assuring that management provides guidance to the board of directors and stockholders that is divorced from such concerns. Moreover, this also will help to ensure that the management team stays intact before, during and after a change in control, thereby protecting the interests of stockholders as well as the acquirer.
These severance and change and control agreements supersede and replace the terms of such executive officer’s employment agreement or offer letter with respect to severance and change in control payments, where applicable. For information on the severance and change in control agreements, see “—Severance and Change in Control Agreements” below. Also see “—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control” below.
Clawbacks of Incentive Compensation
As part of our transition from a privately-held to publicly-traded company, the intent of the Company and the compensation committee is to implement during this fiscal year a formal set of standards addressing the treatment of previously paid or awarded executive incentives in the event of certain circumstances in which it is later determined by the board of directors or the compensation committee, in their sole discretion, that fraud, misconduct, negligence or other material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under securities laws significantly contributed to a misstatement of financial results that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation. It is our intent that such clawback standards will fully comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requiring repayment of any excess incentive-based
 
119
Table of Contents

compensation paid during the three-year period preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare the accounting restatement based upon erroneous data.
Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation
Because of limitations of Code Section 162(m), we generally receive a tax deduction for compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer and to certain other executive officers only if the compensation is less than $1 million per person during any fiscal year or is performance-based as defined under Code Section 162(m).
In addition to salary and bonus compensation, upon exercise of stock options that are not treated as incentive stock options, the excess of the current market price over the option price, or option spread, is treated as compensation and accordingly, in any year, such exercise may cause an officer’s compensation to exceed $1 million. Option spread compensation from options that meet certain requirements will not be subject to the $1 million cap on deductibility, and in the past we have granted options that we believe meet those requirements.
The compensation committee intends to maintain an approach that links pay to performance and, while the compensation committee has not formally adopted a policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our named executive officers, the compensation committee intends to consider tax deductibility under the Code Section 162(m) as a factor in compensation decisions.
Risk Review of Compensation Plans
Generally, the Company and the compensation committee do not believe that any of our compensation plans encourage executives or employees to engage in unnecessary or excessive risks that would threaten the value of the Company. As part of our overall evaluation of compensation programs that we will perform as part of our evolution toward becoming a publicly traded company, the compensation committee will more formally review the Company’s compensation plans and the associated potential risks. More specifically, we will review:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
the compensation plans applicable to our executive officers to reaffirm and ensure that they do not encourage them to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the Company and that any potential risks are appropriately mitigated;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
employee compensation plans in light of the risks posed to the Company by these plans and how such risks are limited; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
our executive and employee compensation plans to reaffirm and ensure that these plans do not encourage the manipulation of the reported earnings of the Company to enhance the compensation of any of the Company’s employees.

Employment Agreements and Offer Letters
The following is a summary of the employment agreements and offer letters with our named executive officers in effect as of December 31, 2011. As described below under “Severance and Change in Control Agreements,” our compensation committee has approved severance and change in control agreements for each of our named executive officers which, where applicable, supersede and replace the terms of officers’ prior employment agreements and offer letters with respect to severance and change in control payments.
John Woolard. We entered into an employment contract with John Woolard, our President and Chief Executive Officer, dated as of October 18, 2006. The employment contract has no specific term and constitutes at-will employment. In addition to a current annual base salary of $445,000, Mr. Woolard is entitled to receive a deposit or credit of $6,000 per year plus 7.5% of his base salary into either a tax-qualified pension plan or a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Mr. Woolard is also eligible to participate in our employee benefit plans currently available to senior executive employees. As a condition to Mr. Woolard’s employment, he entered into a confidential information and inventions assignment agreement. Mr. Woolard is also subject to a non-solicitation provision that extends for a period of twelve months following termination of his employment.
To provide Mr. Woolard with retirement benefits reasonably comparable to colleagues in Israel, in 2008, the Company entered into an annuity contract with an initial purchase payment of $93,158, and has made additional contributions each fiscal year. Mr. Woolard has selected May 1, 2055 as the date

upon which annuity income payments would begin (the Annuity date). Should Mr. Woolard and other named annuitants (Teresa Deaner, his spouse) die prior to this date, the funds in the annuity shall revert to Mr. Woolard’s designated beneficiaries. The contract also provides for Mr. Woolard to make full or partial withdrawals from this account prior to the Annuity Date.
Jack Jenkins-Stark. We entered into an offer letter with Jack Jenkins-Stark, our Chief Financial Officer, dated as of April 2, 2007. The offer letter contract has no specific term and constitutes at-will employment. Mr. Jenkins-Stark’s current annual base salary is $295,000. On May 11, 2007, in accordance with the terms of his offer letter, our board of directors granted Mr. Jenkins-Stark an option to purchase 166,666 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.41 per share. The stock option vests 20% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date with the remainder vesting ratably over the next 48 months. Mr. Jenkins-Stark is also eligible to receive benefits that are substantially similar to the three most senior officers in the Company. As a condition to Mr. Jenkins-Stark’s employment, he entered into a confidential information and inventions assignment agreement. Mr. Jenkins-Stark is also subject to a non-solicitation provision that extends for a period of twelve months following termination of his employment.
To provide Mr. Jenkins-Stark with retirement benefits reasonably comparable to colleagues in Israel, in 2008 the Company entered into an annuity contract with an initial purchase payment of $43,421, and has made additional contributions each fiscal year. Mr. Jenkins-Stark has selected April 1, 2039 as the date upon which annuity income payments would begin (the Annuity date). Should Mr. Jenkins-Stark and other named annuitants (Marilyn Jenkins-Stark, his spouse) die prior to this date, the funds in the annuity shall revert to Mr. Jenkins-Stark’s designated beneficiaries. The contract also provides for Mr. Jenkins-Stark to make full or partial withdrawals from this account prior to the Annuity Date.

BSII entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Israel Kroizer, BSII’s President and Vice President of Israeli Operations of BrightSource, dated as of October 22, 2006.

Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Kroizer is entitled to receive certain cash bonus payments or equity awards upon the achievement of certain milestones. Further, BSII is obligated to establish and pay a certain percentage of Mr. Kroizer’s salary to a manager’s insurance policy which would cover payments made towards severance, pension, disability and a certain percentage to an education fund. Upon the termination of Mr. Kroizer’s employment with BSII for any reason other than termination by BSII for cause, Mr. Kroizer shall be entitled to receive the manager’s insurance policy held by BSII in his name, and all amounts accrued therein and the education fund held by BSII in his name, and all amounts accrued therein. Further, to the extent the amount accrued in the severance fund do not satisfy the amount owed to Mr. Kroizer pursuant to Israel’s Severance Pay Law, which entitles Mr. Kroizer to severance pay equal to one month’s salary for every year of employment with BSII, the Company shall pay such additional amount. As a condition to Mr. Kroizer’s employment, he entered into a confidential information and inventions assignment agreement. Mr. Kroizer is also subject to a non-solicitation and non-competition provision that extends for a period of twelve months following termination of his employment. “Cause” is defined in Mr. Kroizer’s amended and restated employment agreement.

Severance and Change in Control Agreements
The compensation committee has approved severance and change in control agreements for each of our executive officers in order to provide reasonable protection when a change in control could affect their security, authority, or compensation. This also promotes the interests of stockholders by mitigating executives’ concerns about such personal matters and thereby assuring that management provides guidance to the board of directors and stockholders that is divorced from such concerns. Moreover, this also will help to ensure that the management team stays intact before, during, and after a change in control, thereby protecting the interests of stockholders as well as the acquirer.
These severance and change and control agreements supersede and replace the terms of such executive officer’s employment agreement or offer letter with respect to severance and change in control payments.

Pursuant to severance and change in control agreements, if during the twelve-month period immediately following a change of control, (x) the Company terminates an executive’s employment with the Company for a reason other than cause or the executive’s death or disability, or (y) an executive resigns from such employment for good reason, then the executive will receive the following severance benefits from the Company: (i) a lump sum severance payment equal to a portion of the executive’s base salary; (ii) a lump sum severance payment equal to a certain percentage of the executive’s full target bonus for the fiscal year in effect at the date of such termination of employment; (iii) reimbursement for premiums paid for coverage pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or COBRA, for the executive and the executive’s eligible dependents; (iv) accelerated vesting as to a stipulated percentage of the then unvested portion of all of the executive’s outstanding equity awards; (v) outplacement benefits; (vi) all accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements, wages, and other benefits due to the executive under any Company-provided plans, policies and arrangements; and (vii) such other compensation or benefits as may be required by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the executive is legally entitled to any statutory severance (e.g., mandatory severance pursuant to Israel’s Severance Payment Law), the amount of such statutory severance shall be paid in accordance with applicable law, but shall reduce the severance benefits described above.
An executive’s receipt of severance payments or benefits pursuant to a severance and change in control agreement is subject to the executive signing a separation agreement and release of claims, complying with a non-solicit provision and a confidential information agreement.
The severance and change in control agreements define “Cause” to mean: (i) the executive’s willful failure to perform his or her duties and responsibilities to the Company or the executive’s violation of any written Company policy; (ii) the executive’s commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in injury to the Company; (iii) the executive’s unauthorized use or disclosure of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party to whom the executive owes an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of his or her relationship with the Company; or (iv) the executive’s material breach of any of his or her obligations under any written agreement or covenant with the Company.
The severance and change in control agreements define “Change of Control” to mean the occurrence of any of the following:
(i) the consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity or any other corporate reorganization, if the Company’s stockholders immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or reorganization cease to directly or indirectly own immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization at least a majority of the combined voting power of the continuing or surviving entity’s securities outstanding immediately after such merger, consolidation or other reorganization;
(ii) the consummation of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (other than (x) to a corporation or other entity of which at least a majority of its combined voting power is owned directly or indirectly by the Company, (y) to a corporation or other entity owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the common stock of the Company, or (z) to a continuing or surviving entity described in clause (i) above in connection with a merger, consolidation or corporate reorganization which does not result in a Change in Control under clause (i) above);
(iii) a change in the effective control of the Company which occurs on the date that a majority of members of the Company’s board of the directors is replaced during any twelve month
 
130
Table of Contents

period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the board of directors prior to the date of the appointment or election. For purposes of this clause, if any person (as defined below in clause (iv)) is considered to be in effective control of the Company, the acquisition of additional control of the Company by the same person will not be considered a Change in Control;
(iv) the consummation of any transaction as a result of which any person becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing at least fifty percent of the total voting power represented by the Company’s then outstanding voting securities. For purposes of this clause (iv), the term “person” shall have the same meaning as when used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act but excludes:
(1) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or an affiliate of the Company;
(2) a corporation or other entity owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the common stock of the Company;
(3) the Company; and
(4) a corporation or other entity of which at least a majority of its combined voting power is owned directly or indirectly by the Company; or
(v) a complete winding up, liquidation or dissolution of the Company.
A transaction shall not constitute a Change in Control if its sole purpose is to change the state of the Company’s incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the Company’s securities immediately before such transactions.
The severance and change in control agreements define “Good Reason” to mean the executive’s termination of employment within 90 days following expiration of any cure period (discussed below) following the occurrence, without the executive’s consent, or one or more of the following:
(i) a material reduction of the executive’s duties, authority or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction; provided, however, that a reduction in duties, authority or responsibilities solely by virtue of the Company being acquired and made part of a larger entity (as, for example, when the Chief Executive Officer of the Company remains as such following a change of control but is not made the Chief Executive Officer of the acquiring corporation) will not constitute Good Reason;
(ii) a material reduction in the executive’s base compensation (except where there is a reduction applicable to all similarly situated executive officers generally); provided, that a reduction of less than ten percent will not be considered a material reduction in base compensation; or
(iii) a material change in the geographic location of the executive’s primary work facility or location; provided, that a relocation of less than fifty miles from the executive’s then-present work location will not be considered a material change in geographic location.
The executive will not resign for Good Reason without first providing the Company with written notice within 60 days of the event that the executive believes constitutes “Good Reason” specifically identifying the acts or omissions constituting the grounds for Good Reason and a reasonable cure period of not less than 30 days following the date of such notice during which such condition must not have been cured.
 
131
Table of Contents

The severance and change in control agreements define “Disability” to mean that the executive is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted, or can be expected to last, for a continuous period of not less than one year.
Separation Agreements
Effective December 2, 2011, the Company entered into a separation and release agreement with Dr. Carlos Aguilar. Under the terms of this agreement, in exchange for a general release of claims in favor of the Company, the Company will: (i) pay Dr. Aguilar $250,000 in severance over a 12-month period in accordance with standard payroll practices; (ii) pay a portion of Dr. Aguilar’s COBRA premiums equal to the amount the Company contributes for active employees until the earlier of: (1) December 2, 2012; or (2) Dr. Aguilar obtains medical insurance for himself and his dependents through another employer or provider; and (iii) provide outplacement services for six months offered through Lee Hecht Harrison.
Stock Plans
2006 Stock Plan
Our board of directors adopted our 2006 Stock Plan, or the 2006 Plan, in August 2006, which became effective upon approval by our stockholders and was last amended on December 27, 2010. Our 2006 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to our employees (and employees of our subsidiaries), and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights to our employees, directors and consultants (and employees and consultants of our subsidiaries). No new awards will be granted under our 2006 Plan following this offering, but previously granted awards will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder.
The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2006 Plan is 5,356,666 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, options to purchase 3,670,474 shares of our common stock were outstanding and 1,324,888 shares were available for future grants.
Our board, or a committee that it appoints, administers the 2006 Plan. The administrator has the power and authority to determine the terms of the awards, including eligibility, the exercise price, the number of shares, the vesting schedule and exercisability of awards and the form of consideration payable upon exercise and to construe and interpret the 2006 Plan and awards.
With respect to all incentive stock options granted under the 2006 Plan, the exercise price must at least be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. With respect to all nonstatutory stock options granted under the 2006 Plan, the exercise price must at least be equal to 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The term of an option may not exceed 10 years, except that with respect to any participant who owns 10% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding stock as of the grant date, the term must not exceed five years and the exercise price must equal at least 110% of the fair market value on the grant date. The administrator determines all other terms of the options. After a participant’s termination of service, the participant may exercise his or her option, to the extent vested as of the date of termination, for a period of thirty days (or 12 months in the case of termination due to death or disability) following such termination, or such longer period of time specified in the individual option agreement, but in no event beyond the expiration of its term.
Stock purchase rights are rights to purchase our common stock that vest in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator, in its sole discretion.
 
132
Table of Contents

Unless otherwise determined by the administrator, the 2006 Plan generally does not allow for the sale or transfer of awards under the 2006 Plan other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and may be exercised during the lifetime of the participant only by such participant.
In the event of certain changes made in our common stock, appropriate adjustments will be made in the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the 2006 Plan and/or the number, class and price of shares covered by each outstanding award and the numerical share limits contained in the 2006 Plan. In the event of our dissolution or liquidation, all outstanding awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.
In the event of certain change in control transactions, including our merger with or into another corporation or the sale of substantially all of our assets, the administrator may (1) provide for the assumption or substitution of, or adjustment to, each outstanding award; (2) accelerate the vesting and termination of outstanding awards; and/or (3) provide for termination of awards on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, including providing for the cancellation of options or stock purchase rights for a cash payment to the plan participants.
Our board of directors may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the 2006 Plan, provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. Our 2006 Plan will terminate in connection with, and contingent upon, the effectiveness of this offering; provided that the 2006 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of awards originally granted under the 2006 Plan.
2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan
Our board of directors adopted our 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2011 Plan, in July 2011 and amended and restated it effective March 5, 2012, that will be effective once approved by our stockholders, which we expect to occur prior to the effectiveness of this offering. The 2011 Plan will not be utilized until after the completion of this offering. As recommended by the compensation committee of the board of directors, our 2011 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Code Section 422, to our employees and any of our subsidiary corporations’ employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants and our subsidiary corporations’ employees and consultants. The following summary of terms of the 2011 Plan is based on the terms of the 2011 Plan as approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors, but the terms are not final until adopted by the board of directors and approved by the stockholders.
Authorized Shares.    The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2011 Plan is the lesser of: 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the closing of this offering or 5,333,333 shares of our common stock, plus (i) any shares that as of the completion of this offering, have been reserved but not issued pursuant to any awards granted under our 2006 Plan and are not subject to any awards granted thereunder, and (ii) any shares subject to awards under the 2006 Plan that otherwise would have been returned to the 2006 Plan on account of the expiration, cancellation or forfeiture of such award, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2011 Plan pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above equal to 4,995,363 shares as of December 31, 2011. In addition, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2011 Plan will be annually increased on the first day of each of our fiscal years beginning with the 2013 fiscal year, by an amount equal to the least of:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
2,000,000 shares;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the last day of our immediately preceding fiscal year; or

 
 	Ÿ	 	
such other amount as our board of directors may determine.

 
133
Table of Contents

Shares issued pursuant to awards under the 2011 Plan that we repurchase or that are forfeited, will become available for future grant under the 2011 Plan on the same basis as the award initially counted against the share reserve. In addition, to the extent that an award is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the 2011 Plan.
Award Limitations.    The following limits apply to any awards granted under the 2011 Plan:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Options and stock appreciation rights—no employee shall be granted within any fiscal year one or more options or stock appreciation rights, which in the aggregate cover more than 250,000 shares; provided, however, that in connection with an employee’s initial service as an employee, an employee’s aggregate limit may be increased by 500,000 shares;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Restricted stock and restricted stock units—no employee shall be granted within any fiscal year one or more awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units, which in the aggregate cover more than 250,000 shares; provided, however, that in connection with an employee’s initial service as an employee, an employee’s aggregate limit may be increased by 500,000 shares; and

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Performance units and performance shares—no employee shall receive performance units or performance shares having a grant date value (assuming maximum payout) greater than two million dollars or covering more than 250,000 shares, whichever is greater; provided, however, that in connection with an employee’s initial service as an employee, an employee may receive performance units or performance shares having a grant date value (assuming maximum payout) of up to an additional amount equal five million dollars or covering up to 500,000 Shares, whichever is greater. No individual may only have one award of performance units or performance shares for a performance period.

Plan Administration.    The 2011 Plan will be administered by our board of directors which, at its discretion or as legally required, may delegate such administration to our compensation committee and/or one or more additional committees. In the case of awards intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m), the compensation committee will consist of two or more “outside directors” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m).
Subject to the provisions of our 2011 Plan, the administrator has the power to determine the terms of awards, including the recipients, the exercise price, if any, the number of shares subject to each award, the fair market value of a share of our common stock, the vesting schedule applicable to the awards, together with any vesting acceleration, and the form of consideration, if any, payable upon exercise of the award and the terms of the award agreement for use under the 2011 Plan. The administrator also has the authority, subject to the terms of the 2011 Plan, to amend existing awards, to prescribe rules and to construe and interpret the 2011 Plan and awards granted thereunder.
Stock Options.    The administrator may grant incentive and/or nonstatutory stock options under our 2011 Plan; provided that incentive stock options are only granted to employees. The exercise price of such options must equal at least the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The term of an option may not exceed ten years. Provided, however, that an incentive stock option held by a participant who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock, or of certain of our subsidiary corporations, may not have a term in excess of five years and must have an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The administrator will determine the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, shares or other property acceptable to the plan administrator. Subject to the provisions of our 2011 Plan, the administrator determines the remaining terms of the options (e.g., vesting). After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, the participant may exercise his or her option, to the extent vested as of such date of termination, for the period of time stated in his or her
 
134
Table of Contents

option agreement. Generally, if termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for twelve months. In all other cases, the option will generally remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. However, in no event may an option be exercised later than the expiration of its term.
Stock Appreciation Rights.    Stock appreciation rights may be granted under our 2011 Plan. Stock appreciation rights allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. Subject to the provisions of our 2011 Plan, the administrator determines the terms of stock appreciation rights, including when such rights vest and become exercisable and whether to settle such awards in cash or with shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, except that the per share exercise price for the shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right will be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant. The specific terms will be set forth in an award agreement.
Restricted Stock.    Restricted stock may be granted under our 2011 Plan. Restricted stock awards are grants of shares of our common stock that are subject to various restrictions, including restrictions on transferability and forfeiture provisions. Shares of restricted stock will vest and the restrictions on such shares will lapse, in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. Such terms may include, among other things, vesting upon the achievement of specific performance goals determined by the administrator and/or continued service to us. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Recipients of restricted stock awards generally will have voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares upon grant without regard to vesting, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Shares of restricted stock that do not vest for any reason will be forfeited by the recipient and will revert to us. The specific terms will be set forth in an award agreement.
Restricted Stock Units.    Restricted stock units may be granted under our 2011 Plan, which may include the right to dividend equivalents, as determined in the discretion of the administrator. Each restricted stock unit granted is a bookkeeping entry representing an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of our common stock. The administrator determines the terms and conditions of restricted stock units including the vesting criteria, which may include achievement of specified performance criteria or continued service to us, and the form and timing of payment. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. The administrator determines in its sole discretion whether an award will be settled in stock, cash or a combination of both. The specific terms will be set forth in an award agreement.
Performance Units/Performance Shares.    Performance units and performance shares may be granted under our 2011 Plan. Performance units and performance shares are awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the administrator are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator will establish organizational or individual performance goals in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or the value of performance units and performance shares to be paid out to participants. For purposes of such awards, the performance goals may be one or more of the following, as determined by the administrator: (i) sales or non-sales revenue; (ii) return on revenues; (iii) operating income; (iv) income or earnings including operating income; (v) income or earnings before or after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or amortization; (vi) income or earnings from continuing operations; (vii) net income; (vii) pre-tax income or after-tax income; (viii) net income excluding amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and/or excluding charges attributable to the adoption of new accounting pronouncements; (ix) raising of financing or fundraising; (x) project financing; (xi) revenue backlog; (xii) power purchase agreement backlog; (xiii) gross margin; (xiv) operating margin or profit margin; (xv) capital expenditures, cost targets, reductions and savings and expense management; (xvi) return on assets (gross or net), return on investment, return on capital, or return on stockholder
 
135
Table of Contents

equity; (xvii) cash flow, free cash flow, cash flow return on investment (discounted or otherwise), net cash provided by operations, or cash flow in excess of cost of capital; (xviii) performance warranty and/or guarantee claims; (xix) stock price or total stockholder return; (xx) earnings or book value per share (basic or diluted); (xxi) economic value created; (xxii) pre-tax profit or after-tax profit; (xxiii) strategic business criteria, consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified market penetration or market share, geographic business expansion, objective customer satisfaction or information technology goals; (xxiv) objective goals relating to divestitures, joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and similar transactions; (xxv) construction projects consisting of one or more objectives based upon meeting project completion timing milestones, project budget, site acquisition, site development, or site equipment functionality; (xxvi) objective goals relating to staff management, results from staff attitude and/or opinion surveys, staff satisfaction scores, staff safety, staff accident and/or injury rates, headcount, performance management, completion of critical staff training initiatives; (xxvii) objective goals relating to projects, including project completion timing milestones, project budget; (xxviii) key regulatory objectives; and (xxix) enterprise resource planning. After the grant of a performance unit or performance share, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such performance units or performance shares. Performance units shall have an initial dollar value established by the administrator prior to the grant date. Performance shares shall have an initial value equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned performance units or performance shares in the form of cash, in shares or in some combination thereof. The specific terms will be set forth in an award agreement.
Automatic Director Grants.    Our 2011 Plan also provides for the automatic grant of nonstatutory stock options to our non-employee directors. Each non-employee director initially appointed to the board of directors after the completion of this offering will automatically receive an option to purchase a number of shares determined by dividing (x) $127,500, by (y) the value, on the date of grant, of an option to purchase one share using a Black-Scholes valuation model or such other valuation method as the administrator determines in its discretion, with the number of shares rounded up to the nearest whole share or a restricted stock unit subject to a number of shares determined by dividing (x) $127,500 by (y) the fair market value of a share on the date of grant, with the number of shares rounded up to the nearest whole share upon such appointment (excluding an employee director who ceases to be an employee but remains a director). This initial award will vest as to 33% of the shares subject to the option on the one year anniversary of the vesting commencement date and 1/36th of the shares subject to the option each month thereafter over the next two years, provided he or she continues to serve as a director through each relevant vesting date. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2013, non-employee directors will automatically receive a subsequent option to purchase a number of shares determined by dividing (x) $85,000, by (y) the value, on the date of grant, of an option to purchase one share using a Black-Scholes valuation model or such other valuation method as the administrator determines in its discretion, with the number of shares rounded up to the nearest whole share or a restricted stock unit subject to a number of shares determined by dividing (x) $85,000 by (y) the fair market value of a share on the date of grant, with the number of shares rounded up to the nearest whole share shortly after each date of our annual meeting of stockholders. These subsequent awards will vest as to 100% of shares subject to the award on the earlier of (1) the one year anniversary of the vesting commencement date or (2) the day prior to the next annual meeting of stockholders; provided he or she continues to serve as a director through the relevant vesting date. All awards granted under the automatic grant provisions will have a term of ten years or such earlier expiration date specified in the applicable award agreement, an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and will be freely transferable to the non-employee directors’ venture capital funds or employers (or an affiliate, within the meaning of Section 424(e) or (f) of the Code, of a non-employee director’s employer). The administrator may change the number, type and terms of future automatic awards granted to our non-employee director under the 2011 Plan. Additionally, non-employee directors are eligible to receive discretionary grants.

Table of Contents

Transferability of Awards.    Unless the administrator provides otherwise, our 2011 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards and only the recipient of an option or stock appreciation right may exercise such an award during his or her lifetime.
Certain Adjustments.    In the event of certain changes in our capitalization, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under the 2011 Plan, the administrator will make adjustments to one or more of the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the plan and/or the number, class and price of shares covered by each outstanding award and the numerical share limits contained in the plan. In the event of our proposed winding up, liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as soon as practicable and all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.
Merger or Change in Control.    Our 2011 Plan provides that in the event of a merger or change in control (other than a winding up, dissolution or liquidation), as defined under the 2011 Plan, each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines, except that if a successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary does not assume or substitute an equivalent award for any outstanding award, then such award will fully vest, all restrictions on such award will lapse, all performance goals or other vesting criteria applicable to such award will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and such award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction. The award will then terminate upon the expiration of the specified period of time. If the service of an outside director is terminated on or following a change of control, other than pursuant to a voluntary resignation, his or her options, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights, if any, will vest fully and become immediately exercisable, all restrictions on his or her restricted stock will lapse, and all performance goals or other vesting requirements for his or her performance shares and units will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and all other terms and conditions met.
Plan Amendment, Termination.    Our board of directors has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the 2011 Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. Our 2011 Plan will automatically terminate in 2021, unless we terminate it sooner.
2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our board of directors adopted our 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, in July 2011 and amended and restated it effective March 5, 2012, that will be effective once approved by our stockholders, which we expect to occur prior to the effectiveness of this offering. Our executive officers and all of our other employees will be allowed to participate in our ESPP. In general, we intend to make offerings under the ESPP that qualify under Section 423 of the Code, but may make offerings that are not intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code to the extent deemed advisable for designated subsidiaries outside the United States. Additionally, we may make separate offerings under the ESPP, each of which may have different terms, but each separate offering will be intended to comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. The following summary of terms of the ESPP is based on the terms of the ESPP as approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors, but the terms are not final until adopted by the board of directors and approved by the stockholders.
A total of 333,333 shares of our common stock will be made available for sale under our ESPP. In addition, our ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2013 fiscal year, equal to the least of:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
333,333 shares;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the first day of such fiscal year; or

 
 	Ÿ	 	
such other amount as our board of directors may determine.

 
137
Table of Contents

Our board of directors or its committee has full and exclusive authority to interpret the terms of the ESPP and determine eligibility.
All of our employees are eligible to participate if they are customarily employed by us or any participating subsidiary for more than 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. However, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase stock under our ESPP if such employee:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
immediately after the grant would own stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our capital stock; or

 
 	Ÿ	 	
holds rights to purchase stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans that would accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 worth of our stock for each calendar year.

Our ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code, and provides for consecutive, non-overlapping six-month offering periods. The offering periods generally start on the first trading day on or after June 1 and December 1 of each year, except for the first such offering period which will commence on the first trading day on or after the effective date of this offering and will end on December 1, 2012. The administrator may, in its discretion, modify the terms of future offering periods.
Our ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, which includes a participant’s regular and recurring straight time gross earnings, payments for overtime and shift premium, exclusive of payments for incentive compensation, bonuses and other similar compensation. A participant may purchase a maximum of 1,250 shares of common stock during each six-month offering period.
Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant are used to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of each six-month offering period. The purchase price of the shares will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the last day of the offering period. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering period, and will be paid their accrued payroll deductions that have not yet been used to purchase shares of common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us.
A participant may not transfer rights granted under the ESPP other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise provided under the ESPP.
In the event of our merger or change of control, as defined under the ESPP, a successor corporation may assume or substitute each outstanding purchase right. If the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the outstanding purchase rights, the offering period then in progress will be shortened, and a new exercise date will be set. The plan administrator will notify each participant in writing that the exercise date has been changed and that the participant’s option will be exercised automatically on the new exercise date unless the participant has already withdrawn from the offering period.
Our ESPP will automatically terminate in 2021, unless we terminate it sooner. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate our ESPP, except that, subject to certain exceptions described in the ESPP, no such action may adversely affect any outstanding rights to purchase stock under our ESPP.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Matters
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which will be in effect upon the completion of this offering, contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Consequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or

 
 	Ÿ	 	
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be in effect upon the completion of this offering provide that we are required to indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under the provisions of Delaware law. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by our board of directors. With specified exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including, among other things, attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these individuals in any action or proceeding. We believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. We also maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification.
In addition to the director and executive officer compensation arrangements discussed above under “Executive Compensation,” the following is a description of transactions since January 1, 2008, to which we have been a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers, beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or entities affiliated with them, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
Alstom Agreements
Partnership Agreement
In connection with our Series D preferred stock financing, in August 2010, we signed a preferred partnership agreement with Alstom to jointly market and bid on projects to design and construct solar

Table of Contents

thermal power plants in the Mediterranean ring, North Africa and the Republic of South Africa. In December 2010, along with an additional equity investment in BrightSource by Alstom, we amended and restated our partnership agreement to further expand our business partnership to include certain other countries in the Middle East. We further expanded the partnership in August 2011 to include India and in March 2012 to include Australia. In February 2012, we amended the partnership agreement to jointly develop a product that uses steam production from a solar field and solar receiver to supplement a gas turbine combined cycle plant or a gas turbine open cycle plant, which we refer to as Integrated Solar Combined Cycle, or ISCC. The partnership is coordinated by a project coordination committee comprised of two members from each party. The partnership agreement has a term of 10 years.
Preferred Supplier Agreement
In connection with our Series D preferred stock financing, in August 2010, we signed a preferred turbine supplier agreement pursuant to which we designated Alstom as a preferred supplier of the next eight steam turbines (or 2,000 MW) to BrightSource facilities (excluding Ivanpah). We expanded our relationship with Alstom in December 2010 by entering into an amended and restated preferred equipment supply agreement dated as of December 27, 2010, to provide that Alstom will also be a supplier of solar receivers and other specified equipment for certain projects in which we are responsible for selecting the suppliers of such equipment or the EPC. In March 2012, we amended the preferred equipment supply agreement to expand the number of preferred supply projects. As amended, BrightSource is obligated under the agreement to grant preferred supply rights to Alstom for twelve preferred supply projects or preferred supply projects with a gross output totaling 3,000 MW, whichever comes first.
In addition, pursuant to the preferred equipment supplier agreement that provides that Alstom will be our preferred supplier of solar receivers for certain projects, in August 2011, we signed a letter agreement regarding the design and development of such subcritical solar receivers. This letter agreement was amended in March 2012 to support the development of smaller subcritical solar receivers. In March 2012, we signed letter agreements regarding the design and development of supercritical solar receivers and steam turbine generators and a combined molten salt and steam receiver. The letter agreements set forth the development program, schedule and project organization and terminate upon completion of the development program.
Ashalim Project
In connection with our submittal of a joint bid with Alstom in response to a tender process conducted by the State of Israel for a 110 MW solar thermal power plant near Ashalim, Israel, we entered into several agreements with Alstom. These include a consortium agreement for the performance of EPC work on the project, and a shareholders agreement regarding governance of the jointly owned project company that would own the project.
Convertible Note
In May 2010, we received proceeds of $15.5 million through the issuance of a convertible note payable to Alstom. The terms of the note provided that it would automatically convert into shares of our Series D preferred stock upon execution of certain agreements at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as Alstom’s investment in our Series D financing, which also occurred in May 2010. In August 2010, we entered into a strategic partnership with Alstom triggering an automatic conversion of the note. As a result of contractual provisions and a pre-defined ownership percentage, we repaid Alstom approximately $2.7 million in principal and accrued interest, and the remainder of the note was converted into 1,908,831 shares of our Series D preferred stock.
Concurrent Private Placement
In March 2012, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Alstom, pursuant to which Alstom will purchase $65.0 million of our common stock, at a price per share equal to the initial public

Table of Contents

offering price, in a private placement to close subsequent to the closing of this offering. In connection with the Alstom private placement, we amended our investor rights agreement to provide Alstom with registration rights with respect to the shares issued in the private placement. We also granted Alstom certain notice rights in the event that we receive an offer from a competitor of Alstom to purchase shares of BrightSource and participation rights in the event that we issue additional shares after our initial public offering, in each case so long as Alstom holds at least 12.5% of our outstanding shares.
Assignment Agreement
On October 24, 2006, BrightSource entered into an assignment agreement with Los Angeles Advisory Services Incorporated, or LAAS. Arnold Goldman, the founder of BrightSource and our current Chairman Emeritus, is the sole member of LAAS’s board of directors and is the beneficial owner of all the LAAS’s outstanding capital stock. Pursuant to the assignment agreement, LAAS transferred certain proprietary technologies, including technologies related to solar thermal energy generation, to BrightSource in consideration for 2,500,000 shares of BrightSource’s common stock, a one-time royalty payment equal to $125,000 payable within three days of the date of the assignment agreement and a monthly royalty payment of $22,000 payable during the 48-month period following the date of the assignment agreement. The amount of royalty payments was determined through negotiations between LAAS and the lead Series A investor, which were conducted in good faith at arm’s-length and which we believe reflected a fair value for LAAS’s proprietary technologies. BrightSource also granted to LAAS a royalty free, non-exclusive license to utilize certain technologies that do not relate to solar thermal energy generation and storage, which license terminates on the earlier of October 24, 2011 and immediately following the termination of Arnold Goldman’s employment without cause pursuant to his contract of employment with BSII.
Morgan Stanley BrightSource Loan
On May 16, 2007, Solar Partners II, LLC, or SPII, one of the project companies we formed to facilitate the development of Ivanpah, and Morgan Stanley BrightSource LLC, or MSBS, entered into a development loan agreement for the first plant of the Ivanpah project. MSBS is one of our investors. SPII, MSBS and Morgan Stanley & Co., Incorporated (an affiliate of MSBS), also entered into a related development letter agreement and an amended and restated limited liability company agreement for SPII, in which MSBS acquired a 50% interest. As of October 30, 2009, the parties to the development letter agreement terminated that agreement. Additionally on that date, SPII and MSBS entered into the first amendment to the development loan agreement so that MSBS had no further obligation to loan money to SPII. We also acquired the membership interest of MSBS in SPII, making SPII our wholly-owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2010, the principal amount outstanding under the development loan agreement was $3,059,000 with $781,000 in long-term accrued interest. In April 2011, we closed the financing of Ivanpah with third parties, and, as a result of this transaction, the development loan agreement ceased to be a primary obligation of the Company.
Series A Warrants
In November 2011, a majority of the disinterested members of our board of directors approved the amendment of warrants to purchase shares of our Series A preferred stock held by certain VantagePoint Capital Partners funds. The warrants amendment extended the exercise period of the warrants through December 15, 2011. The warrants were exercised on December 7, 2011.
Employment of Related Persons
Gil Kroyzer, son of Israel Kroizer, our Executive Vice President of Engineering, R&D and Product Supply, is employed by BSII as Senior Director Modeling and Solar Field Design. Or Kroizer, son of Israel Kroizer, was recently hired by BSII as Solar Field Modeling Expert. Daniel Goldman, son of

Stockholder Agreements
In connection with the sale of our Series A, B, C, D and E preferred stock, we entered into agreements that grant customary preferred stock rights to all of our major preferred stock investors, including holders of more than 5% of our preferred stock at the time of the transactions at issue. The rights include registration rights, rights of first refusal, co-sale rights with respect to stock transfers, a voting agreement providing for the election of investor designees to our board of directors, information rights and other similar rights. In connection with the Alstom and Caithness concurrent private placements, we amended our investor rights agreement to provide Alstom and Caithness with registration rights with respect to the shares issued in the concurrent private placements. We also granted Alstom certain notice rights in the event that we receive an offer from a competitor of Alstom to purchase shares of BrightSource and participation rights in the event that we issue additional shares after our initial public offering, in each case so long as Alstom holds at least 12.5% of our outstanding shares. The amended and restated investors’ rights agreement, dated December 28, 2010, as amended on March 11, 2011 and March 19, 2012, which contains the registration rights and many of the other rights described above, is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.

The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock (after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering) as of March 1, 2012 and as adjusted to reflect the sale of the common stock offered by us under this prospectus by:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
each entity or person who is known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our common stock (on an as-converted basis);

 
 	Ÿ	 	
each of our directors and named executive officers; and

 
 	Ÿ

To our knowledge, except under applicable community property laws or as otherwise indicated, the persons named in the table have sole voting and sole investment control with respect to all shares beneficially owned. The applicable percentage of ownership for each stockholder before this offering is based on 35,139,355 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 1, 2012, after giving effect to a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our common stock to be effected prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and the resulting 1-for-3 conversion ratio adjustment applicable to our convertible preferred stock and the conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering (which includes 3,671,144 additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E preferred stock, as described in “Capitalization,” based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus), together with applicable options and warrants for that stockholder. Percentage ownership of our common stock after this offering also assumes the sale of 3,409,090 shares of common stock to Alstom and Caithness in the concurrent private placements, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options and warrants and other rights beneficially owned are deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of the person holding these options and other rights, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
Upon the completion of this offering, BrightSource will be authorized to issue 750,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share. All currently outstanding shares of preferred stock will be converted into common stock upon the completion of this offering.
Common Stock
As of December 31, 2011, there were 35,139,335 shares of common stock outstanding, as adjusted to reflect (i) a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our common stock to be effected prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and the resulting 1-for-3 conversion ratio adjustment applicable to our convertible preferred stock and (ii) the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock, Series B preferred stock, Series C preferred stock, Series D preferred stock and Series E preferred stock (which includes the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E preferred stock at an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, as described above in “Capitalization”), held of record by 130 stockholders. Options to purchase 3,670,474 shares of common stock were also outstanding as of December 31, 2011. There will be 45,448,425 shares of common stock outstanding (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares or exercise of outstanding options under BrightSource’s stock option plans after December 31, 2011), after giving effect to the sale of the shares offered hereby.
The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. See “Dividend Policy.” In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of BrightSource, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to the prior distribution rights of any outstanding preferred stock. The common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. The outstanding shares of common stock are, and the shares of common stock to be issued upon completion of this offering will be, fully paid and non-assessable.
Preferred Stock
Upon the closing of the offering, all outstanding shares of preferred stock will be converted into 30,069,900 shares of common stock and automatically retired (reflecting a 1-for-3 conversion ratio as a result of the reverse stock split of our common stock). Thereafter, the board of directors will have the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, in one or more series. The board of directors will also have the authority to designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of each such series, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series.
The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of BrightSource without further action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock. In certain circumstances, an issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock. As of the closing of the offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding. BrightSource currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Warrants
The following table sets forth information about outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock as of December 31, 2011. The warrants to purchase shares of preferred stock will convert into warrants to purchase shares of common stock on the completion of this offering on a 1-to-0.3333 basis. Generally, each warrant contains provisions for the adjustment of the exercise price and the aggregate number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant under certain circumstances, including stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations and certain dilutive issuances of securities at prices below the then existing warrant exercise price.

(1)	Warrant expires on the earliest to occur: (i) the specified expiration date, (ii) three years after this offering or (iii) a merger or consolidation involving us in which we are not the surviving entity, or in which our outstanding shares of capital stock are otherwise converted into or exchanged for shares of capital stock of another entity, and in which the holders of the Series D preferred stock or Series E preferred stock receive cash or freely publicly tradable securities in such transaction.
(2)	Warrants expire on the earliest to occur: (i) the specified expiration date or (ii) immediately prior to the closing of the sale, conveyance or disposal of all or substantially all of our property or business or our merger with or into or consolidation with any other corporation (other than our wholly-owned subsidiary) or any other transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of our capital stock is disposed of, excluding a merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing our domicile or to an equity financing in which we are the surviving corporation.
Registration Rights
Upon completion of this offering and the concurrent private placements, the holders of 33,478,990 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 108,590 shares of our common stock (in all cases assuming the conversion of all outstanding preferred stock upon completion of this offering) or their transferees will be entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of such shares under the Securities Act. These rights are provided under the terms of an investors’ rights agreement between us and the holders of these securities. Subject to limitations in the agreement, the holders of at least a majority of these securities then outstanding may require, on two occasions beginning six months after the date of this prospectus, that we use our best efforts to register these securities for public resale if Form S-3 is not available. If we register any of our common stock either for our own account or for the account of other security holders, the holders of these securities are entitled to include their shares of common stock in that registration, subject to the ability of the underwriters to limit the number of shares included in the offering. The holders of at least twenty-five percent of these securities then outstanding (or a lesser percent if the anticipated aggregate offering price, net of underwriting commissions and discounts, would exceed $10,000,000) may also require us, not more than twice in any twelve-month period, to register all or a portion of these securities on Form S-3 when the use of that form becomes available to us, provided, among other limitations, that the proposed aggregate selling price is at least $2,000,000. We will be responsible for paying all registration expenses, and the holders selling their shares will be responsible for paying all selling expenses.
Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, which will be in effect upon the completion of this offering, will contain certain provisions that could
 
149
Table of Contents

have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing another party from acquiring control of us. These provisions and certain provisions of Delaware law, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate more favorable terms with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us.
Undesignated Preferred Stock
As discussed above, our board of directors will have the ability to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us. These and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of our company.
Limits on Ability of Stockholders to Act by Written Consent or Call a Special Meeting
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our stockholders may not act by written consent, which may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions. As a result, a holder controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to amend our bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of our stockholders called in accordance with our bylaws.
In addition, our amended and restated bylaws will provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of the board, the Chief Executive Officer or our board of directors. Stockholders may not call a special meeting, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for holders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.
Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals
Our amended and restated bylaws will establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our board of directors or a committee of our board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
Board Classification
Upon the closing of the offering, our board of directors will be divided into three classes, one class of which is elected each year by our stockholders. The directors in each class will serve for a three-year term. For more information on the classified board, see “Management—Board of Directors.” A third party may be discouraged from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us as it is it more difficult and time-consuming for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors on a classified board.
No Cumulative Voting
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors. Cumulative voting allows a stockholder to vote a portion or all of its shares for one or more candidates for seats on the board of directors. Without
 
150
Table of Contents

cumulative voting, a minority stockholder may not be able to gain as many seats on our board of directors as the stockholder would be able to gain if cumulative voting were permitted. The absence of cumulative voting makes it more difficult for a minority stockholder to gain a seat on our board of directors to influence our board’s decision regarding a takeover.
Amendment of Charter and Bylaws Provisions
The amendment of the above provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will require approval by holders of at least a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. The amendment of our bylaws will require approval by the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute
We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
prior to the date of the transaction, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, calculated as provided under Section 203; or

 
 	Ÿ	 	
at or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting stock. We expect the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of directors does not approve in advance. We anticipate that Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.
The provisions of Delaware law and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended upon the completion of this offering, could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they might also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions might also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
The Transfer Agent and Registrar for the common stock is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The Transfer Agent’s address and telephone number is Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 64854, St. Paul, Minnesota 55164, (800) 468-9716.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise equity capital in the future.
Upon completion of the offering and the concurrent private placements, we will have outstanding 45,448,425 shares of common stock (or 46,483,425 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full), assuming an initial public offering price at the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Of these shares, 6,900,000 shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, unless purchased by “affiliates” of BrightSource as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which generally includes officers, directors and 10% stockholders.
The remaining 38,548,425 shares outstanding, which includes the shares sold in the concurrent private placements, are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. These shares may be sold in the public market only if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration such as Rules 144 or 701 promulgated under the Securities Act, which are summarized below. Sales of these shares in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
We, our executive officers and directors and holders of substantially all of our capital stock will have entered into lock-up agreements generally providing that they will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sales or otherwise dispose of our common stock, or any options or warrants to purchase any shares of our common stock, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive shares of our common stock, owned by them for a period continuing through 180 days after the date of this prospectus (subject to extension), except with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and us. As a result of these contractual restrictions, notwithstanding possible earlier eligibility for sale under the provisions of Rules 144 and 701, shares subject to lock-up agreements may not be sold until such agreements expire or are waived by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and us. Taking into account the lock-up agreements, and assuming Goldman, Sachs & Co., with our consent, does not release stockholders from these agreements, the following shares will be eligible for sale in the public market at the following times:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
Beginning on the date of this prospectus, only the shares sold in the offering will be immediately available for sale in the public market as registered shares.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
Beginning 180 days after the date of this prospectus, approximately 369,443 shares will be eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 701 and approximately 38,178,982 additional shares will be eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144, of which all but 12,628,694 shares are held by affiliates.

In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, and beginning after the expiration of the lock-up agreement (generally 180 days after the date of this prospectus) of a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who has beneficially owned restricted shares for at least six months would be entitled to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of: (i) one percent of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding; or (ii) the average weekly trading volume of the common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the sale. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about BrightSource. Under Rule 144, a person who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of BrightSource at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, is entitled to sell such shares without complying with the manner of sale, public information, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144.

Upon completion of this offering and the concurrent private placements, the holders of approximately 33,478,990 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 108,590 shares of common stock or their transferees will also be entitled to certain rights with respect to registration of their shares of common stock for offer or sale to the public (including the shares issued in the concurrent private placements). If the holders, by exercising their registration rights, cause a large number of shares to be registered and sold in the public market, the sales could have a material adverse effect on the market price for BrightSource’s common stock.
Beginning 180 days after the effective date, any employee, officer or director of or consultant to BrightSource who purchased shares pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract may be entitled to rely on the resale provisions of Rule 701. Rule 701 permits affiliates to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. Rule 701 further provides that non-affiliates may sell such shares in reliance on Rule 144 without having to comply with the holding period, public information, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144. In addition, BrightSource intends to file registration statements under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the effective date to register shares to be issued pursuant to BrightSource’s employee benefit plans. As a result, any options exercised under the Stock Plan or any other benefit plan after the effectiveness of such registration statement will also be freely tradable in the public market, except that shares held by affiliates will still be subject to the volume limitation, manner of sale, notice and public information requirements of Rule 144 unless otherwise resalable under Rule 701. As of December 31, 2011, there were outstanding options to purchase 3,670,474 shares, of which options to purchase 1,897,409 shares were exercisable. No shares have been issued to date under the Company’s 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan or 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. See “Executive Compensation—Stock Plans” and “Description of Capital Stock—Registration Rights.”

CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND ESTATE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS
The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax and estate tax consequences to non-U.S. holders relating to the ownership and disposition of our common stock, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations relating thereto. This summary is based upon the provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof. These authorities may be changed, possibly retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income or estate tax consequences different from those set forth below. We have not sought any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions.
This summary also does not address the tax considerations arising under the laws of any non-U.S., state or local jurisdiction, or under U.S. federal gift and estate tax laws, except to the limited extent below. In addition, this discussion does not address tax considerations applicable to a non-U.S. holder’s particular circumstances or to non-U.S holders that may be subject to special tax rules, including, without limitation:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
tax-exempt organizations;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
partnerships or other entities treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
dealers in securities or currencies;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than five percent of our common stock, except to the extent specifically set forth below;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
persons who hold our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale, or other integrated security transaction; or

 
 	Ÿ	 	
persons who do not hold our common stock as a capital asset (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code).

If a partnership or entity treaty as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, partnerships that hold our common stock, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors.
You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

Non-U.S. Holder Defined
For purposes of this discussion, a non-U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia;

 
 	Ÿ	 	
a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes);

 
 	Ÿ	 	
an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

 
 	Ÿ	 	
a trust (x) whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (y) which has made an election to be treated as a U.S. person.

Distributions
If we make a distribution of cash or other property (other than certain pro rata distributions of our common stock) in respect of our common stock, the distribution will be treated as a dividend to the extent it is paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). If the amount of a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess first will be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the non-U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common stock, and thereafter will be treated as capital gain. Distributions treated as dividends on our common stock held by a non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate if provided by an applicable income tax treaty and the non-U.S. holder has provided the documentation required to claim benefits under such treaty. Generally, to claim the benefits of an income tax treaty, a non-U.S. holder will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN.
If, however, a dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the non-U.S. holder (and, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States), the dividend will not be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax (provided the non-U.S. holder has provided the appropriate documentation, generally an IRS Form W-8ECI, to the withholding agent), but the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the dividend on a net income basis, and at graduated rates, in substantially the same manner as U.S. persons. Dividends received by a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and which are effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business may also be subject to a branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or a lower rate if provided by an applicable tax treaty).
A non-U.S. holder that is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax under an income tax treaty may obtain a refund or credit of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for a refund together with the required information with the IRS.
Gain on Disposition of Common Stock
Subject to the discussion below of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, and backup withholding, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of our common stock unless:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
such non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of such sale or disposition, and certain other conditions are met;

 
155
Table of Contents

 	Ÿ	 	
such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business in the United States (and, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States); or

 
 	Ÿ	 	
our common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest by reason of our status as a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or a USRPHC, at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or the non-U.S. holder’s holding period for our common stock.

A non-U.S. holder that is an individual and who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of such sale or disposition, if certain other conditions are met, will be subject to tax at a gross rate of 30% on the amount by which such non-U.S. holder’s taxable capital gains allocable to U.S. sources, including gain from the sale or other disposition of our common stock, exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources, except as otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty.
Gain realized by a non-U.S. holder that is effectively connected with such non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis, and at graduated rates, in substantially the same manner as a U.S. person (except as provided by an applicable tax treaty). In addition, if such non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or a lower rate if provided by an applicable tax treaty).
Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (all as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). There can be no assurances that we are not now nor will become a USRPHC in the future. If, however, we were a USRPHC during the applicable testing period, as long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, our common stock will be treated as U.S. real property interests only for a non-U.S. holder who actually or constructively holds (at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or the non-U.S. holder’s holding period) more than 5% of such regularly traded stock. Please note, though, that we can provide no assurance that our common stock will remain regularly traded.
Federal Estate Tax
Our common stock beneficially owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States (as defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes) at the time of death will generally be includable in the decedent’s gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise.
Recently Enacted Legislation Affecting Taxation of Our Common Stock Held By or Through Foreign Entities
Recently enacted legislation as part of FATCA generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our common stock paid after December 31, 2012, to a foreign financial institution unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. Secretary of Treasury to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners). The legislation also will generally impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our common stock paid after
 
156
Table of Contents

December 31, 2012, to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification (i) that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners” or (ii) provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners,” which we will in turn provide to the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in our common stock.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Generally, we must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder, the non-U.S. holder’s name and address, and the amount of tax withheld, if any. A similar report is sent to the non-U.S. holder. Pursuant to applicable income tax treaties or other agreements, the IRS may make these reports available to tax authorities in the non-U.S. holder country of residence.
Payments of dividends or of proceeds on the disposition of stock made to a non-U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the non-U.S. holder establishes an exemption, for example by properly certifying the non-U.S. holder’s status on a Form W-8BEN or another appropriate version of IRS Form W-8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding and information reporting may apply if either we or our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax; rather, the U.S. income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund or credit may generally be obtained from the IRS, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.
The preceding discussion of U.S. federal tax considerations is for general information only. It is not tax advice. Each prospective investor should consult its own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of our common stock, including the consequences of any proposed change in applicable laws.

The underwriters are committed to take and pay for all of the shares being offered, if any are taken, other than the shares covered by the option described below unless and until this option is exercised.
If the underwriters sell more shares than the total number set forth in the table above, the underwriters have an option to buy up to an additional 1,035,000 shares from the Company. They may exercise that option for 30 days. If any shares are purchased pursuant to this option, the underwriters will severally purchase shares in approximately the same proportion as set forth in the table above.
The following table shows the per share and total underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters by the Company. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase 1,035,000 additional shares.

Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $             per share from the initial public offering price. If all the shares are not sold at the initial public offering price, the representatives may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.
The Company, its executive officers and directors and holders of substantially all of the Company’s capital stock will have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock, or any options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for or that request the right to receive shares of common stock for a period continuing through 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and the Company. Exceptions include (i) the issuance and sale of shares of common stock in this offering and the concurrent private placements, (ii) grants to employees pursuant to employee equity incentive plans existing on the date of the underwriting agreement, (iii) issuances upon the exercise of stock options or
 
158
Table of Contents

upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of exercisable, convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding as of the date of the underwriting agreement or (iv) the issuance of common stock in connection with mergers or acquisitions of securities, businesses, property or other assets, joint ventures, strategic alliances, equipment leasing arrangements or debt financing up to an aggregate of 5% of the sum of the Company’s fully-diluted shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus plus the shares sold in this offering, provided that any recipient of such common stock agrees in writing to be subject to the lockup restriction. See “Shares Eligible for Future Sale” for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions.
The 180-day restricted period described in the preceding paragraph will be automatically extended if: (1) during the last 17 days of the 180-day restricted period the Company issues an earnings release or announces material news or a material event; or (2) prior to the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 15-day period following the last day of the 180-day period, in which case the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release of the announcement of the material news or material event.
Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering price has been negotiated among the Company and the representatives. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be the Company’s historical performance, estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the Company, an assessment of the Company’s management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses.
An application has been made to list the common stock on the The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “BRSE.”
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering. “Covered” short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from the Company in the offering. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option granted to them. “Naked” short sales are any sales in excess of such option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering.
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.
Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Company’s stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the common stock. As a result, the price of the
 
159
Table of Contents

common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued at any time. These transactions may be effected on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
European Economic Area
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a Relevant Member State), each underwriter has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the Relevant Implementation Date) it has not made and will not make an offer of shares to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the shares which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of shares to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time:
 
 	(a)	to legal entities which are authorised or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorised or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities;
 
 	(b)	to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total balance sheet of more than €43,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than €50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts;
 
 	(c)	to fewer than 100 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive) subject to obtaining the prior consent of the representatives for any such offer; or
 
 	(d)	in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the Issuer of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of shares to the public” in relation to any shares in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the shares to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the shares, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
Each underwriter has represented and agreed that:
 
 	(a)	it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the shares in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and
 
 	(b)	it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the shares in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
The shares may not be offered or sold by means of any document other than (i) in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), or (ii) to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures

This prospectus has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Accordingly, this prospectus and any other document or material in connection with the offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the shares may not be circulated or distributed, nor may the shares be offered or sold, or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to persons in Singapore other than (i) to an institutional investor under Section 274 of the Securities and Futures Act, Chapter 289 of Singapore (the “SFA”), (ii) to a relevant person, or any person pursuant to Section 275(1A), and in accordance with the conditions, specified in Section 275 of the SFA or (iii) otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicable provision of the SFA.
Where the shares are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 by a relevant person which is: (a) a corporation (which is not an accredited investor) the sole business of which is to hold investments and the entire share capital of which is owned by one or more individuals, each of whom is an accredited investor; or (b) a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor) whose sole purpose is to hold investments and each beneficiary is an accredited investor, shares, debentures and units of shares and debentures of that corporation or the beneficiaries’ rights and interest in that trust shall not be transferable for 6 months after that corporation or that trust has acquired the shares under Section 275 except: (1) to an institutional investor under Section 274 of the SFA or to a relevant person, or any person pursuant to Section 275(1A), and in accordance with the conditions, specified in Section 275 of the SFA; (2) where no consideration is given for the transfer; or (3) by operation of law.
The securities have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan (the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law) and each underwriter has agreed that it will not offer or sell any securities, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan (which term as used herein means any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan), or to others for re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to a resident of Japan, except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of, and otherwise in compliance with, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and any other applicable laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.
The underwriters do not expect sales to discretionary accounts to exceed five percent of the total number of shares offered.
The Company estimates that its share of the total expenses of the offering, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $6.1 million.
The Company has agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933.
The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and
 
161
Table of Contents

brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. were lenders under the Company’s credit facility. In connection with the closing of Ivanpah financing in April 2011, the borrowings under the credit facility were repaid in-full and the credit facility terminated. As described under “Prospectus Summary—The Offering,” the terms of our Series E preferred stock provide that the ratio at which each share of Series E preferred stock automatically converts into shares of our common stock in connection with a qualified IPO (for which this offering will qualify) will increase if the initial public offering price per share of common stock in the qualified IPO is below a specified minimum dollar amount, which would result in additional shares of common stock being issued upon conversion of the Series E preferred stock. In the event the actual initial public offering price is lower than $32.49 per share (including any price within the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus), the shares of Series E preferred stock will convert into a larger number of shares of common stock. An affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. owns 2,308,243 shares of our Series E preferred stock. If the initial public offering price is equal to the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, the Series E preferred stock owned by the affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. would convert into 1,136,363 shares of common stock, or 2.5% of our common stock outstanding at December 31, 2011 after giving effect to this offering (including the conversion of all our outstanding convertible preferred stock) and the concurrent private placements. If the initial public offering price is equal to the low end of the range, the Series E preferred stock owned by the affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. would convert into 1,190,476 shares of common stock, or 2.6% of our common stock outstanding at December 31, 2011 after giving effect to this offering (including the conversion of all our outstanding convertible preferred stock) and the concurrent private placements. If the initial public offering price is equal to the high end of the range, the Series E preferred stock owned by the affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. would convert into 1,086,956 shares of common stock, or 2.4% of our common stock outstanding at December 31, 2011 after giving effect to this offering (including the conversion of all our outstanding convertible preferred stock) and the concurrent private placements. Solely for illustrative purposes, if the initial public offering price is $1.00 below the low end of the range, the Series E preferred stock owned by the affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. would convert into 1,250,000 shares of common stock, or 2.8% of our common stock outstanding at December 31, 2011 after giving effect to this offering (including the conversion of all our outstanding convertible preferred stock) and the concurrent private placements, which number of shares and percentage of ownership would further increase if the initial public offering price were even lower than $1.00 below the low end of the range. The shares of common stock into which such Series E preferred stock will be converted are subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(g)(1). The affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (or permitted assignees under the Rule) may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate the shares of common stock, nor will they engage in any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of the shares of common stock for a period of 180 days from the date of effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.
In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the issuer. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
Lazard Frères & Co. LLC referred this transaction to Lazard Capital Markets LLC and will receive a referral fee from Lazard Capital Markets LLC in connection therewith.

CONCURRENT PRIVATE PLACEMENTS
On March 19, 2012, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Alstom pursuant to which Alstom has agreed to purchase $65.0 million of our common stock at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of the prospectus, this would be 2,954,545 shares. The Alstom private placement is expected to close the later of (i) immediately subsequent to the closing of this offering or (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. We will receive the full proceeds and will not pay any underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to the shares that are sold in the private placement. In connection with the Alstom private placement, we expanded our preferred partnership agreement and preferred supplier agreement and the scope of our joint development efforts.
On March 19, 2012, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Caithness pursuant to which Caithness has agreed to purchase $10.0 million of our common stock at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of the prospectus, this would be 454,545 shares. The Caithness private placement is expected to close immediately subsequent to the closing of this offering. We will receive the full proceeds and will not pay any underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to the shares that are sold in the private placement. In connection with the Caithness private placement, we entered into a non-binding term sheet regarding a proposed solar power generation development company. This joint venture would initially develop six solar thermal projects, including the three Rio Mesa and two Hidden Hills projects. Under the term sheet, Caithness would contribute up to 50% of the equity required during development, subject to our achievement of certain milestones. The proposed solar power generation development company is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. We cannot assure you when, or if, such agreements will be executed.
In connection with these private placements, we have amended our investors’ rights agreement to grant Alstom and Caithness registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock they will purchase in the concurrent private placements. We also granted Alstom certain notice rights in the event that we receive an offer from a competitor of Alstom to purchase shares of BrightSource and participation rights in the event that we issue additional shares after our initial public offering.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
BrightSource Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BrightSource Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1. OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY
BrightSource Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) is a leading solar thermal technology company that designs, develops and sells proprietary systems that produce reliable, clean energy in utility-scale electric power plants. The Company’s systems use proprietary solar power tower technology to deliver cost-competitive renewable electricity and high-temperature steam for use in applications such as thermal enhanced oil recovery, or EOR. While the Company primarily sells systems using its proprietary technology, the Company also acts as the system architect for the layout and optimization of the solar field. In addition, the Company provides technical services related to the design, engineering and operation of the Company’s systems and may provide overall project development services. In implementing systems using the Company’s proprietary technology, the Company partners with several parties to develop utility-scale solar electric power plants. These parties include engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, contractors; boiler suppliers; turbine suppliers; and financing parties that may consist of strategic and/or financial investors.
The Company was initially formed on April 5, 2004, as Luz II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and began its operations on May 1, 2006. On August 17, 2006, the LLC was converted to Luz II, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company changed its name to BrightSource Energy, Inc. in May 2007. As part of the conversion from an LLC entity, the Company converted membership units previously issued to investors, and to certain founders and other individuals associated with the LLC, to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series 1 and shares of its common stock. The Company’s operations in Israel, primarily relate to research and development, project engineering services and equipment sales for the Company’s solar thermal systems and related projects.
The Company also has formed U.S. project companies for the development of solar thermal projects. Each of these project companies is independent of each other and can have different investors. For the projects where the Company leads development, the Company expects to initially own 100% of the equity in the projects, but may seek development partners at various stages on specific projects. A project’s assets are typically held by a special purpose, single member limited liability company, in which the Company is initially the sole member, that the Company refers to as a project company. The Company intends to ultimately transfer the majority of the equity in these project companies to third parties while retaining a minority equity interest. Outside of the United States, the Company may or may not have ownership interests in such projects using its systems.
The industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive and is characterized by the risks of changing technologies, market conditions, and regulatory requirements. Penetration into markets requires investment of considerable resources and continuous development efforts. The Company’s future success depends upon several factors, including the technological quality, price, and performance of its products and services relative to those of its competitors, the ability to secure adequate project financing at appropriate terms, the price of electricity in the markets in which the Company operates, access to appropriate sites for its solar thermal systems, and the nature of regulation in those markets.
The Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s future financial position and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to: a limited operating history; the limited history of the Company’s proprietary technology, which may perform below expectations when implemented in the Company’s existing projects; new and rapidly evolving markets; a lengthy sales cycle; federal and state environmental and tax policies; reliance on additional equity or debt issuances at appropriate terms for funding of operations; the development of future solar thermal projects using the Company’s technology; dependence on the development of new technology and services; obligations under various commitments and guarantees; unfavorable economic and market conditions; competition from larger and more established companies; limited management resources; dependence on a limited number of contract

Table of Contents

manufacturers and suppliers; and the ability to execute on the Company’s existing and future pipeline of power purchase agreements and the changing nature of the solar thermal energy industry. Failure by the Company to anticipate or to respond adequately to technological developments in its industry, changes in customer or supplier requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards, or any significant delays in the development or introduction of technology and services, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and operating results.
The Company has incurred net losses of $43.8 million, $71.6 million and $111.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $288.2 million and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $206.5 million.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Basis of Presentation—Prior to 2010 the Company was a development stage company as it was devoting substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business and planned principal operations had not commenced nor generated significant revenue. In 2010, the Company exited the development stage and began its principal operations. Additionally, in 2010 the Company obtained a series of corporate financings, obtained project financing commitments and construction activities commenced on the Company’s first utility scale solar thermal project.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and reflect the results of the Company and its subsidiaries which include wholly-owned project companies and variable interest entities for which the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company did not recognize any components of comprehensive income (loss) therefore, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss.
Use of Estimates—The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results may differ from such estimates. Significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments made by the Company include the determination of the fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants, accrued warranty reserves, fair value of share-based awards issued, valuation of assets acquired, fair value of the deconsolidated subsidiary, allocation of costs to the project companies, evaluation for certain impairments, valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, evaluation and fair value of various guarantees, and the estimated total costs to complete long-term construction contracts.
Reclassifications—The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Specifically, the Company previously reported depreciation and share-based compensation as separate financial statement line items. The Company now allocates depreciation and share-based compensation in the consolidated statement of operations to the respective operating expense line items, based on their nature. Additionally, in 2011 the Company reclassified interest income and equity method loss to “Other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statement of operations. Other income (expense) items are discussed in more detail in Note 13.
Unaudited Pro Forma—The December 31, 2011 unaudited pro forma stockholders’ equity has been prepared assuming that upon the completion of a qualifying initial public offering (i) all the Company’s shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2011 automatically
 
F-8
Table of Contents

converted into 30,069,900 shares of common stock upon the completion of its initial public offering (which includes the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company’s Series E preferred stock, as described in Note 10).
Variable Interest Entities— The Company typically forms special purpose entities to capture all costs of developing a solar thermal project, which it refers to as project companies. During the initial development phases, the Company is typically the sole investor in these project companies and is the primary beneficiary. As a project proceeds, other partners may invest in the project company. As other partners acquire or contribute interests in a project company, the Company reevaluates whether the project company remains a VIE. If the project company is deemed to be a VIE, the Company performs an analysis to determine whether it is the primary beneficiary. If the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it consolidates the project company in its consolidated financial statements. If the Company should determine that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of the project company, the Company will deconsolidate the project company and recognize any gain or loss associated with the deconsolidation event.
Cash and Cash Equivalents—The Company holds and invests its available cash balances in demand deposits and money market funds. The money market funds are considered short-term investments and have original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. These investments are considered highly liquid and are considered cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash—The Company holds cash in restricted accounts pursuant to security provisions associated with certain commercial agreements, such as, equipment purchases, service contracts, operating leases, power purchase agreements (“PPA”) and performance guarantees. As such, the Company has pledged cash in support of letters of credit, escrow agreements, and control agreements with respect to future payments and deposit obligations. The Company classifies its restricted cash as current (applied within the next twelve months) or noncurrent in its consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of when the cash is expected to be contractually released.
Accounts Receivable/Accounts Receivable—Related Party—Accounts receivable are carried at net realizable value and are reviewed for collectibility on an ongoing basis. The Company’s accounts receivable activity to date are derived primarily from the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project and sales of solar thermal systems to the Ivanpah HoldCo, a related party, and Bechtel who is our EPC contractor for Ivanpah. The Company monitors the credit worthiness of its customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company did not recognize any allowances for doubtful accounts.
Deposits—The Company’s deposits consist primarily of payments for long-lead time equipment, interconnection and project development security associated with the Company’s PPAs. Generally, these deposits are refundable should the Company terminate the related agreement. The Company classifies its deposits as current or noncurrent assets based on the expected delivery of equipment or expected timing of the return of deposited amounts. When deposits are applied to purchases of goods, amounts are expensed to “Cost of Revenues” in the period applied.
Concentrations of Credit Risk—Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and money market funds with high quality financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.
Inventories—The Company generally purchases custom-made goods from external vendors which are then sold to and delivered directly to the customer. Given the level of customization required,
 
F-9
Table of Contents

the Company generally prepays the vendor or provides the vendor with a deposit when the orders are placed. These amounts are generally recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as vendor prepayments or prepaid assets , which are included in “Prepaid and other current asset.” When the goods are delivered to the customer, the Company will recognize the prepayments or deposits as “Cost of revenues.” Inventories are primarily composed of materials-in-process that the Company intends to sell to the Ivanpah project companies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out cost method. Inventory mark-downs or write-offs, if any, are recognized in the period in which they occur. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company did not recognize any write-downs of inventory amounts as the Company believes that actual costs for inventories approximate their market values based on existing sales contracts.
Property, Plant and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment, net, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
 
Computer and equipment

  	3-5 years
Software

  	3-7 years
Office furniture and equipment

  	3-7 years
Manufacturing and production equipment

  	2-7 years
Leasehold improvements

  	Shorter of the useful life
or lease term
Construction-in-progress consists primarily of project tooling(s) that is under construction for lease in the Company’s solar thermal projects.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Capitalized Project Costs—The Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with the development of solar thermal projects upon meeting specific project viability criteria. Evidence of project viability includes securing the site by option, lease or acquisition; the evaluation of studies supporting the suitability of a site for the solar thermal project; and an off-take agreement or a viable economic analysis. The Company’s viable economic analysis generally assesses the ability of the project to meet the Company’s required internal rates of return for project investments through expected cash distributions and other economic benefits (e.g., tax benefits) associated with the project, taking into account all capital, development and operating costs of the project, including debt financing costs. Upon satisfaction of these criteria, the Company’s management and project managers determine whether a project has met a project economic viability threshold and assess whether the specific project is probable to progress to full development and will ultimately realize future positive cash flows. Project costs incurred prior to meeting these thresholds are expensed as incurred. Upon meeting these thresholds, costs directly related to project development, including associated overhead, are capitalized. Capitalized project costs do not include administrative costs, marketing costs or other costs not directly associated with the development of solar thermal projects.
Equity Method Investments—The Company accounts for certain investments under the equity method of accounting when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. The Company records its share of the investee’s income or loss (if any) as “Equity method gains and/or losses” on the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company assesses the carrying value of its equity investment whenever an indicator of a loss in value is present. If the carrying value of the equity investment is greater than the fair market value, the Company then determines whether or not the decline in fair market value is temporary. If a
 
F-10
Table of Contents

decline in the fair market value of the investment is deemed by management to be other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to fair value, with the amount of the write-down included in earnings.
Intangible Assets— Intangible assets, net are composed of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
Interest Capitalization—The Company capitalizes interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring or constructing certain assets during the period of time required to make the asset ready for its intended use. The Company capitalizes interest to the extent that the expenditure to acquire or construct the asset has met capitalization criteria and the interest cost has been incurred. The Company capitalized interest related to the Development Loan acquired as part of the Company’s acquisition of Solar Partners II (“SPII”). The total amount of interest capitalized as of December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and nil, respectively.
Project Divestiture—Upon ceasing to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary, whether by sale, receipt of additional investment, sale of equity interests, contribution of assets or other transfer of an interest in a project company, the Company first evaluates whether the transaction should be accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 810-10-40, Deconsolidation of a Subsidiary or Derecognition of a Group of Assets. If the Company has control of land or land rights; the Company further evaluates whether the assets are determined to be within the scope of ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment-Real Estate Sales. As part of this determination, the Company considers both (i) the stage of development of the project and (ii) the composition and the fair value of assets transferred or contributed within the project companies at the date of the transaction to determine whether a significant amount of the fair value is real estate or non-real estate assets. If the assets are determined to be in the scope of the guidance for real estate sales, the related net assets may continue to be presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements until all requirements of ASC 360-20 have been satisfied. If the transaction is not within the scope of ASC 360-20, and the Company no longer exercises control over the project company or assets, the Company will typically deconsolidate the project company and will derecognize the related net assets associated with the project in accordance with ASC 810-10-40.
In cases where the Company transfers control of the entity but retains an investment in the entity, the Company will generally recognize any resulting gain or loss from deconsolidation of the previously consolidated subsidiary in “Loss from operations.”
Deferred Equity Offering Costs—Deferred equity offering costs are defined as costs directly attributable to the Company’s offering of its equity securities. If the equity offering is not successful, the deferred equity offering costs will be recorded as an expense to the consolidated statement of operations in the period that the determination is made. The Company’s capitalized deferred equity offering costs as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 were approximately $0 and $4.1 million, respectively, and are included in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets.
Guarantees—The Company is subject to various guarantees, including guarantees related to its solar field supply contracts, guarantees related to the Company’s equity investment in Ivanpah HoldCo and various guarantees related to its wholly-owned subsidiaries. For guarantees that are not contingent upon a future event, the Company recognizes the estimated fair value of the guarantee at its inception (fair value model), as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. For guarantees that are contingent upon future events, the Company recognizes the estimated liability for the guarantee when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingent loss is estimable (contingent liability model).
 
F-11
Table of Contents

Product Warranties—The Company generally provides warranties related to its solar thermal supply for a period of up to forty-eight months from the date of the project’s substantial completion. Warranty costs covered under the Company’s standard solar thermal supply warranty generally include costs for repair or product replacement. Warranty reserves are recognized when it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to goods or services that have been sold and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. The Company recognizes a provision for warranties based on estimates of future claims. Estimates for claims are generally based on rates common in the industry given the Company’s lack of actual historical experience. The Company continuously monitors product performance for potential returns and failures.
Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability—The Company accounts for its freestanding warrants for shares of the Company’s convertible preferred stock that is contingently redeemable as liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The warrants are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and the changes in fair value, if any, are recognized as other income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of (i) exercise of the warrants or (ii) expiration of the warrants. Upon conversion, the convertible preferred stock warrant will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital.
Fair Value Measurements—The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are required to be recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring or non-recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for asset and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Where observable prices or inputs are not available valuation models are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity.
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term maturities.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets—The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, capitalized project costs and definite-lived intangibles assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the Company recognizes an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
Convertible Preferred Stock—The Company accounts for its convertible preferred stock based on assessments of all terms and features of each of its convertible preferred stock. As part of this analysis, the Company assesses the economic characteristics and risks of its convertible preferred stock, including conversion, liquidation, and redemption features, as well as dividend and voting rights. The Company evaluates whether each series of its convertible preferred stock is more akin to an equity or debt host contract and whether it has features that may require bifurcation as a derivative liability. The Company also evaluates whether its convertible preferred stock is redeemable or has characteristics that are similar to redemption and may meet any of the following characteristics: (i) redeemable at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (ii) redeemable at the
 
F-12
Table of Contents

option of the holder, or (iii) redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the Company. Convertible securities that have or are or act as redemption features and meet any of the three characteristics described above are classified as temporary equity on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Due to specific contingent conversion terms in the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock Series E, the convertible preferred shares are presented as temporary equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. See Note 10 for additional details.
Segment Reporting—Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company currently has one primary operating activity and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer reviews the financial information for this activity as presented on a consolidated basis. Accordingly, the Company has one operating segment as currently defined.
Revenue and Cost Recognition:
Revenue
The Company primarily sells systems using its technology to utility-scale solar thermal power projects or to oil and gas production companies pursuing thermal EOR activities. The Company also generates revenue from development, engineering and operational services provided to the long-term owners of projects using our systems.
Solar Thermal Systems—The Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion method requires estimates of future costs over the full term of the project. Such cost estimates are made by the Company based on prior operations and specific project characteristics and designs. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from performance guarantees and warranties may result in revisions to the costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Estimating the cost of the various guarantees involves a high degree of management judgment. Due to inherent uncertainties in estimating future costs, job cost estimates are regularly reviewed and updated by management. Revenues from cost-plus-fee contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned, measured by the cost-to-cost method. This method is considered the best available measure of progress on these contracts.
Development, engineering and operating services—Development, engineering and other operating services revenues are recognized once the services are provided or product delivery has been made, as applicable.
For the Company’s tooling lease contracts, the Company records revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease upon the assets, placement into service and acceptance by the customer. Tooling assets, included in property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets’ useful life using the straight-line method.

(1)	This revenue relates to Ivanpah. See Note 5 for details of the revenue arrangements.
(2)	Prior to the consolidation of SPII on October 30, 2009, the Company recorded $3.3 million in development and engineering services—related party for the 10-month period ended October 30, 2009, for solar development activities that the Company conducted on behalf of SPII. The development and engineering services—related party that the Company conducted for SPII included, but were not limited to, activities such as land surveys, insolation testing, feasibility, environmental, ground water, fatal flaw and transmission studies, permitting and power purchase agreement negotiations.
(3)	As of December 31, 2011, the Company has not recorded any revenue related to the leased tooling equipment for Ivanpah HoldCo as the assets are pending acceptance by the customer; rather the lease payments that have been received to date have been recognized as deferred revenue—related party and are included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheet. Revenues for 2011 relate to fees earned from the Company’s consulting activities in South Africa.
The gross unfavorable changes in contract estimates were approximately $7.6 million, $18.0 million and $44.3 million for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, and primarily relate to the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project (as discussed below). The gross unfavorable changes in contract estimates for 2011 are comprised of a $31.1 million for Coalinga and $13.2 for Ivanpah. The gross favorable changes in contract estimates were $0, $0 and $6.1 million for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The favorable change in contract estimate for 2011 relates to the Ivanpah project.
Cost of Revenues and Provision for Loss on Contract:
Contract costs includes all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, and depreciation costs. Marketing, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Change orders either initiated by the Company, or by the customer, are evaluated according to their characteristics and the circumstances in which they occur. Change orders that result in a product or service that is significantly different from the original contract or change orders that significantly alter the contract price either without disregard of the original contract or alter the contract price but do not alter the product or services to be provided are considered to be separate contracts.
Provisions for estimated losses relating to contracts are made in the period in which losses are determined or are estimatable. The Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project was entered into at a loss and as such, the Company initially recognized a provision for loss on contract in the amount of $10.5 million which is included as a component of costs of sales. As the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project was a loss contract, the Company recognized revenue and a corresponding cost of sales over the construction period. However, in 2009, 2010, and 2011, the Company recognized additional provisions for loss on contract in the amount of $7.6 million, $18.0 million, $22.5 million, respectively, which represented the increased estimated cost to complete the contract; the project was delivered to Chevron in October 2011. The revisions to the estimated loss before delivery to Chevron primarily relate to redesign work and change orders that could not be passed onto Chevron under the terms of the contract. As part of the original contract, the Company agreed to provide ongoing operations and maintenance for the project through the first year of operations. In 2011, the Company determined that
 
F-14
Table of Contents

the estimated costs of providing the ongoing operations and maintenance services exceeded the expected revenues and as a result, the Company recognized an additional provision for loss on contract in the amount of $2.4 million. In 2011, the Company recognized $6.3 million of warranty expense following the identification of two specific design or component failures for which the Company is liable under its warranty provisions (further discussed in Note 15). The Company has included these warranty expenses in the provision for loss on contract in the consolidated statements of operations. The cumulative provision for loss on the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR contract was approximately $67.3 million through December 31, 2011. Until satisfaction of the twelve month performance test and completion of the warranty period, costs related to this project may increase and accordingly, the Company may incur additional provisions for loss on contract.
Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts on the consolidated balance sheet represent costs incurred in excess of revenues recognized.
Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts on the consolidated balance sheet represents billings in excess of revenue recognized. Typically, billings are made based on the completion of certain milestones as provided for in the contracts and generally the timing of revenue recognition is different from the contractual billing schedules.
Research and Development Costs—The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expenses include personnel and personnel-related costs, costs associated with product design, development and pilot construction and testing, research costs and other consulting and professional services, and allocated facility and related expenses.
Share-Based Compensation—The Company accounts for share-based payment transactions using a fair-value based measurement method. Share-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each option’s fair value as calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share-based compensation awards requires the use of judgment and the input of various assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying share, expected future share price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend rate. The Company recognizes employee share-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures rates are estimated at the time of the grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ significantly from estimates. Forfeiture rate estimates are generally based on actual historical forfeitures.
The Company recognizes nonemployee share-based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument determined by the Black-Scholes option model, using the straight-line vesting attribution model. The fair value of the nonemployee awards is remeasured at each reporting period until services required under the arrangement have been completed, which is the vesting date.
For awards with performance conditions, the Company assesses the probability of the performance condition being achieved and, accordingly, if probable, recognizes the expense during the requisite service period. The Company has not issued a material amount of performance-based awards.
Foreign Currency Transactions—The Company and its foreign subsidiaries incur operating expenses in various foreign currencies primarily the Israeli New Shekel and euro. The Company and its subsidiaries’ functional currency is the U.S. dollar, because the U.S. dollar is the primary currency in which the Company transacts. Foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency. At each balance sheet date, each entity
 
F-15
Table of Contents

remeasures the recorded balances related to foreign-currency transactions using the period-end exchange rate. Gains or losses arising from the remeasurement of these balances are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. In addition, at the settlement date of foreign currency transactions, foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations to reflect the difference between the rate effective at the settlement date and the historical rate at which the transaction was originally recorded.
Income Taxes—Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The Company identifies and re-evaluates material tax positions in all taxing jurisdictions for all open years. Once identified, each tax position is evaluated in a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position taken will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step in the process is to apply measurement principles to tax positions which were not highly certain but which were determined to be more likely than not of being sustained. The Company’s policy is to recognize any interest and penalties that it might incur related to its tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
Net Loss Per Share—The Company applies the two-class method for calculating and presenting net income or loss per share. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between shares of common stock and other participating securities based on their participating rights. Participating rights are defined as securities that participate in dividends with common stock according to a pre-determined formula or a contractual obligation to share in the losses of the entity including share-based awards that have not yet vested and the right to receive the dividend is non-forfeitable and non-contingent or there is a contractual obligation to share in the losses of the entity. Basic net income or loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the Company’s net income or loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock used to calculate the Company’s basic net loss per share of common stock excludes those shares subject to repurchase related to stock options that were exercised prior to vesting as these shares are not deemed to be issued for accounting purposes until they vest. The diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities, including stock options, restricted stock, warrants and convertible preferred stock. The Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for all periods presented as the inclusion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding were anti-dilutive.
The following recently issued accounting standards are presented based on the expected period of adoption by the Company:
First Quarter 2012
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements—In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04 (“ASU 2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will substantially change its consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes.

3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
Level I—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level II—Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level III—Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.
The following presents the fair value measurements of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

(1)	The 2010 and 2011 balances of $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, represent amounts due for the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project. In 2011, the Company determined that due to the delay in the annual performance test, the billing of the outstanding balance would be delayed until 2013, when the annual performance test is expected to be completed. As a result, the Company reclassified the balance to long-term in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011.
 
(2)	Costs incurred and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts—related party relate to the Ivanpah project. This liability balance represents amounts billed and collected by the Company from Ivanpah HoldCo. This liability will be reduced as work is performed under the construction contract. Offsetting this balance at December 31, 2011, the Company has recorded the following: approximately $83.0 million as “Restricted cash—Noncurrent” which represents the escrow amounts for the solar field guarantees as discussed in Note 15 and approximately $14.1 million of contract retentions receivable—related party which are included in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet and are expected to be released to the Company after completion of the Ivanpah project.
The costs to complete of the Company’s uncompleted contracts are subject to estimation. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that estimated contract earnings will be further revised in the near term.
Capitalized Project Costs—The Company’s project costs consisted of the following components (in thousands):

Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011 was $0.8 million, $1.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively; of these amounts, approximately $0, $0, and $0.9 million was included in “Cost of revenues” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.
In 2011, the Company determined that certain of its manufacturing and production equipment formerly used for the Coaling Solar-to-Steam for EOR project was impaired due to the fact that the equipment would not be used in future projects of the Company. As a result, the Company recognized a loss on impairment of approximately $2.0 million representing the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value. The fair values of the assets as of the disposal date were determined to be $0 due to the fact that the majority of the assets were obsolete as a result of technological advances and design improvements. The loss on impairment is currently included in “Cost of revenues” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for 2011.

The Company entered into an Assignment Agreement dated October 24, 2006, with Los Angeles Advisory Services Incorporated (“LAAS”) (the “LAAS Assignment Agreement”), pursuant to which LAAS agreed to transfer and assign to the Company all of its rights to proprietary technologies related to the Company’s business, subject to a limited grant back license as described in such agreement. The Company’s gross carrying amount of the license agreement is based on the sum of the payment obligations discounted to present value at the time of acquisition using the then-current weighted-average cost of capital. The LAAS Assignment Agreement provides for initial payment of $0.1 million

and 48 monthly payments of $22,000 discounted to present value at the time of acquisition using the then current weighted average cost of capital. The payable balance as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, are $0.2 million, and $0, respectively.
Amortization of the LAAS intangibles, which consist of the license agreement as described above, is recognized over the estimated useful life using the straight-line method of amortization as it reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise realized. The asset life used for the license agreement is 20 years.
In 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Bechtel Power Corporation (“Bechtel”), the EPC contractor for the Ivanpah Group, to develop a guide book (“Project Power Book”) for the configuration of the Company’s future solar thermal fields. The costs of the Project Power Book will be forgiven by Bechtel provided that the Company or any of its affiliates enters into an EPC Contract for any solar thermal facility within a three-year period from the effective date of the agreement. If the three-year period lapses or the Company terminates the contract the Company would be obligated to pay Bechtel for services incurred at that time. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the Company has recorded an intangible of $2.78 million and $3.0 million, respectively, with corresponding amounts as “Other long-term liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s Project Power Book is amortized over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method of amortization. The asset life used for the Project Power Book is 5 years, as this reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the Project Power Book are expected to be consumed or otherwise realized.
In February 2012, the Company was relieved of its $3.0 million obligation for the Project Power Book as a result of entering into new master services contracts as described in Note 20. The Company will amortize this deferred gain on a straight-line basis over the term of the new contracts.
Amortization expense for the Company’s intangibles for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 was $34,000, $34,000, and $0.5 million, respectively.
Estimated future amortization expense for the intangible assets as of December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):

5. ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION
2009 Asset Acquisition—The Company’s Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (“Ivanpah Group”) was made up of three separate project companies. Two of the project companies were wholly-owned by the Company. The third project company, SPII, was 50% owned until October 2009. On October 30, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in SPII, from MSBS for $1,000. Prior to October 30, 2009, the Company accounted for SPII under the equity method of accounting, which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations through that date in 2009. Based on the Company’s increased investment in SPII as of October 2009, the Company recognized its proportionate share of the equity method loss of approximately $0.5 million, representing SPII’s net loss for the ten months then ended. As a result of the increased ownership interest the Company held all voting rights and was the sole owner of SPII and, as such, consolidated SPII beginning October 30, 2009. Based on the accounting for business combinations the Company determined the transaction to be a purchase of assets. The Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair value of the acquired assets. The fair value of the net assets and liabilities of SPII at the October 30, 2009 acquisition date was determined to be $2,000. As a result, the purchase did not result in any gain or loss.
Subsequent to October 30, 2009, SPII was included as part of the lvanpah Group and was part of the 2011 lvanpah Transaction as described below.
2011 Ivanpah Transaction—Prior to April 5, 2011, the Company was the sole owner of the three project companies referred to as the Ivanpah Group. The entities included in the Ivanpah Group were deemed variable interest entities, or VIEs, and, as such, were consolidated on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For purposes of consolidation all intercompany balances and transactions were eliminated. In March 2011 the Company formed a new entity, Ivanpah HoldCo for the purpose of facilitating investment by third-party investors in the Ivanpah project and as the holding company for the Ivanpah Group.
On April 5, 2011, the Company entered into a funding agreement with unrelated third-party equity investors whereby the new investors contributed $116.8 million in cash to Ivanpah HoldCo and commitments to fund an additional $299.2 million in base equity. The Company contributed its ownership interest in Ivanpah HoldCo including the net assets of the Ivanpah Group, as well as $30.5 million of additional assets. The value of the assets contributed by the Company was $221.0 million, which exceeded its funding obligation under the agreement of $115 million. As part of this transaction, Ivanpah HoldCo distributed $105.5 million in cash to the Company from the $116.8 million of cash contributed by the new investors to reduce the Company’s invested capital from $221 million to the required $115.0 million.
Simultaneous with this transaction the Ivanpah Group entered into loan agreements totaling $1.6 billion. Upon completion of this transaction Ivanpah HoldCo and the Ivanpah Group were fully funded and were no longer deemed VIEs. As a result the Company’s ownership interest is now subject to a voting interest model and accounted for under the equity method. In conjunction with the solar field supply agreements the Company will provide certain warranties and guarantees. The Company is also obligated to fund certain cost overruns experienced as the Ivanpah project is being constructed. See Note 15 for additional detail regarding the nature and extent of these commitments.
The Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair value of Ivanpah HoldCo as of the April 5, 2011 transaction date. In the Company’s determination of the fair value of Ivanpah HoldCo, the Company considered among other factors, two generally accepted valuation approaches: the income approach and the market approach. The Company selected the
 
F-22
Table of Contents

approaches that it believes are most indicative of the fair value of Ivanpah HoldCo. Based on this analysis, the fair value of Ivanpah HoldCo was determined to be $615.0 million as of the transaction date. As a result, the fair value of the Company’s retained 14% economic interest was approximately $84.0 million, which was recorded upon deconsolidation. Because the amounts initially contributed by the third-party investors are not reflective of fair value, the Company realized an overall loss on the divestiture of the 86% equity interest of $77.7 million. This loss is partially offset by the increase in fair value of the 14% retained interest of $54.9 million. Also upon deconsolidation, the Company has removed historical net assets of $213.0 million, recorded a net loss on deconsolidation of $23.0 million in “Loss on deconsolidation of consolidated subsidiary” in the consolidated statement of operations, and received cash of $105.5 million.
The Company deconsolidated Ivanpah HoldCo as required by the deconsolidation guidance under ASC 810, based upon the early stage of the development of the project and the composition and significant fair value of the non-real estate assets associated with Ivanpah HoldCo at the date of the transaction the assets of Ivanpah HoldCo were not deemed real estate assets subject to the guidance of ASC 360-20.
Although the Company’s ownership interest in Ivanpah HoldCo is less than 20% the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence due to its limited participation rights as an equity investor, thermal system sales agreements and performance guarantees, but not control of Ivanpah HoldCo. The Company, upon deconsolidation of the net assets of Ivanpah HoldCo from its consolidated balance sheet, accounts for its investment using the equity method of accounting.
In addition to the Company receiving the 14% economic interest in Ivanpah Holdco as indicated above, the Company entered into solar field supply subcontracts (“SFSS”) with the EPC contractor to provide materials and supporting services; solar field agreements (“SFA”) with the Ivanpah Owners to supply solar field technologies, engineering and consulting services; a common projects solar field agreement (“CPSFA”) with the Ivanpah Owners to lease certain production equipment; compliance services agreement (“CSA”) and; and the continuing general services agreement (“CGSA”) with the Ivanpah Owners to provide technical assistance and other support. Performance and delivery guarantees are provided under both the SFSS and SFA agreements. The Company has determined that these agreements represent a single, related party arrangement.
The Company separated the contracts into the following accounting units: (1) the equity interest in Ivanpah; (2) a contract accounting unit which includes the sales of materials, supporting service, technologies, engineering, consulting services and related guarantees under the SFSS and SFA( accounted under the percentage-of-completion method); (3) the lease of tooling under the CPSFA (recognized over the term of the lease; and (4) services under the CSA and CGSA (recognized as the services as performed). The Company considered whether a re-allocation of arrangement consideration was appropriate pursuant to ASC 605-25 among these four units of accounting, however, the Company determined that the consideration received for the equity interest in Ivanpah HoldCo, as well as the consideration to be received under the SFA, under the SFSS, and under the tooling equipment lease and services are at market terms.
6. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
SPII
In 2009, the Company held an equity interest of approximately 50% in SPII, which was accounted for under the equity-method of accounting; as a result, the Company recognized a loss of approximately $0.5 million loss. In October 2009, SPII became a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Table of Contents

Ivanpah HoldCo
The Company accounts for its investment in Ivanpah HoldCo under the equity method of accounting as the Company’s interest provides it with the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not the control of, Ivanpah HoldCo. The Company eliminates any intercompany profits or losses in relation to its continuing involvement with Ivanpah HoldCo proportionate to its equity interest.
Due to the timing of receipts of financial information of Ivanpah HoldCo, the Company accounts for its investment on a three-month lag. The Company’s policy is to record the effect of events occurring in the lag period that are known and which could materially affect its consolidated financial statements. To date, Ivanpah HoldCo has not generated any revenues, net income or net loss as it is still a development-stage company.
The summarized financial information for Ivanpah HoldCo as of September 30, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):

The weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt was approximately 7.4% in 2010 and approximately 9.1% in 2011.
Credit Facility—On October 4, 2010, the Company entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with certain of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors
 
F-24
Table of Contents

and other subsidiaries of the Company and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Citicorp North America, Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch financial institutions acting as a group. The Credit Agreement provided the Company with a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate available amount of $75.0 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bore interest at either a base rate or the Eurodollar rate as determined by an administrative agent. The weighted-average interest rate for the Credit Facility was 7.4% in 2010 and 7.8% in 2011. In April 2011, in connection with the closing of the Ivanpah HoldCo financing, as discussed in Note 5, the Credit Facility was repaid in full.
Term Loan—On December 28, 2010, the Company entered into a Loan and Guaranty Agreement (“Loan Agreement”) with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. and Hercules Technology II, L.P. (“Lenders”) pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide the Company with a term loan referred to as the Hercules Term Loan (which was subordinated to the $75.0 million Credit Agreement prior to its repayment and termination in April 2011) in the amount of $11.2 million (“Term A”) and $13.8 million (“Term B”) for an aggregate of $25.0 million. Term A was to be repaid by December 28, 2011 and Term B was to be repaid in two installments; the first occurring on the thirteenth month following the close of the agreement with the remainder to be paid on June 28, 2012. The borrowing rate under Term A was 11.0% and under Term B was 12.8%.
In consideration for the Loan Agreement, the Company provided the Lenders with warrants entitling them to a number of fully-paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s convertible preferred stock. The issuance of the warrants resulted in a $0.8 million discount to the Hercules Term Loan, which represented the estimated fair value of the warrants as of the issuance date.
In March 2011, the Company amended the Hercules Term Loan in anticipation of the Company’s closing of the Ivanpah HoldCo financing, as described in Note 5. The amendment to the Hercules Term Loan was effective upon the discharge of the Credit Agreement and amended the amount the Company must maintain collectively at all times in cash and cash equivalents from at least 60% of the outstanding advances to at least 100% of the outstanding advances until all of the Lender’s obligations are paid in full.
On October 7, 2011 the Company repaid the Hercules Term Loan in full and entered into a new revolving loan with Hercules Technology Growth Capital. In connection with the repayment of the loan, the Company recorded a $0.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt, since the terms under the revolving loan are materially different from that of the term loan. The loss is primarily composed of unamortized loan origination costs, including the discount for the warrants.
Revolving loan—On October 7, 2011, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. and Hercules Technology III, L.P., (collectively, “Hercules”). Under the terms of the loan, Hercules has committed to provide the Company with a revolving facility in the aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million (“New Hercules Revolving Loan”); $25.0 million at the commencement of the loan and an additional $10.0 million after the closing of an initial public offering which results in aggregate proceeds of at least $100.0 million (“Qualified IPO”).
The Hercules Revolving Loan bears a floating interest rate equal to the greater of (a) prime plus 7.25% and (b) 10.5% until such time as the Company completes Qualified IPO. Subsequent to a Qualified IPO, the loan will carry an interest rate of the greater of (a) prime plus 5.75% and (b) 9%. If the Company does not complete a Qualified IPO by March 30, 2012, the New Lenders can elect to receive (a) $750,000 or (b) a warrant to purchase 144,265 shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock or Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.6646 per share. Additionally, the Company will be required to pay an unused line fee of 0.75% per annum on the unused portion of the maximum amount available.

Under the agreement, the Company has pledged all of its equity interest in its subsidiaries as collateral for the loan (except that its pledge of equity interest in non-U.S. entities is limited to 66% of such equity interests), and each future guarantor, if any will be required to execute a similar pledge agreement. The Company and the existing guarantors have pledged certain of its intellectual property and other assets, including, among other things, receivables, equipment, fixtures, intangibles, inventory, investment property, deposit accounts and cash, in factor of Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., as collateral agreement and the Company has entered into a security or deposit control agreements with the collateral agent.
The Hercules Revolving Loan agreement contains covenants substantially similar to those of the Initial Hercules Term Loan including but not limited to; a minimum liquidity requirement that requires the Company to maintain collectively, at all times in cash and cash equivalents, an amount equal to 50% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount, in an account to which the Lenders have an account control agreement; limitations on indebtedness, dividends, and other restricted payments. The loan agreement also contains various customary non-financial covenants with which the Company must comply, including, but not limited to, submitting various financial reports and business forecasts, complying with applicable laws and regulations, notice of litigation, notice regarding material agreements, notice of discharge of the Company’s credit facility, limitations on secured indebtedness, limitations on dividends, and notice in the event of default. As of December 31, 2011, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants.
The Company borrowed $25.0 million at the closing of the New Hercules Revolving Loan and used the proceeds to repay the principal amount of the Hercules Term Loan. In connection with the transaction, the Company incurred approximately $1.2 million in debt issuance costs; these costs were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the loan using effective interest method. The revolving loan matures on November 1, 2012.
Development Loan—Related Party—As part of the Company acquisition of SPII on October 30, 2009, the Company assumed a development loan between SPII and MSBS. The development loan agreement was amended on October 30, 2009 so that MSBS had no further obligation to fund SPII and the existing loan, and the principal amount of approximately $3.0 million remains outstanding until the earliest of the following: (i) substantial completion under the EPC Contract with Bechtel Power Corporation for Ivanpah HoldCo, (ii) SPII of Ivanpah HoldCo is placed in service for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (iii) SPII submits the additional data to the U.S. Treasury that the U.S. Treasury requires to pay a cash grant under section 1603 of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act; but in any event the development loan shall be due no later than February 15, 2013.
As of December 31, 2010 the principal amount outstanding under the loan was approximately $3.0 million. Accrued interest was approximately $0.8 million and included in “Other long-term liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets. The weighted-average interest rate on the development loan as of December 31, 2010 was 4.3%. In April 2011, the Company closed the financing of Ivanpah HoldCo with third parties and, as a result of this transaction, the development loan ceased to be the primary obligation of the Company.
BDC Ivanpah Loan—In April 2011, the Company entered into a loan agreement with BDC Ivanpah, LLC (“BDC Ivanpah”) for $20.0 million. The loan bears interest at 16.5% per annum except, upon the occurrence of an event of default, the interest rate increases to 18.5% per annum. The loan matures on April 8, 2016 and is subject to mandatory prepayments in the event that the Company’s loan coverage ratio falls below 2.25:1. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with the loan coverage ratio and, as such, is not subject to any mandatory prepayments.

CMB loan—On November 21, 2011, the Company entered into a secured Loan Agreement with CMB Infrastructure Investment Group VII, LP, or CMB, pursuant to which CMB agreed to provide the Company with a term loan of up to $90 million (“CMB Loan”). The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5% per annum and requires principal repayments of $5 million per year for each of the years 2014 through 2017. The loan matures on the sixth anniversary of the initial funding.
The CMB Loan is funded by individuals seeking permanent resident status in the United States through the “EB-5” visa program. Under this program, foreign persons making qualified investments that create jobs in the United States can obtain permanent residency. The CMB Loan will be funded when the initial phase of the EB-5 application process is complete, which is expected to occur between April and September 2012. The initial advance on the CMB Loan will be used to repay in full the BDC Ivanpah Loan, as described above, with the remaining proceeds being used by the Company. Due in part to the requirements of the EB-5 program, the Company’s ability to prepay the loan is restricted for forty-two months after the initial funding date.
The Company has provided CMB with a security interest in the cash flow from the Ivanpah project. An escrow account supports the CMB Loan, and any cash flow from the Ivanpah project (including the proceeds of any tax equity financing of our interest in the Ivanpah project) will be deposited into the escrow account and held until the loan is repaid, or used to make interest payments or prepayments of principal.
As of December 31, 2011, the loan had not funded and no amounts were outstanding. In connection with the loan, the Company incurred approximately $0.2 million in loan origination fees which were capitalized in 2011. The Company will be obligated to pay CMB an upfront facility fee in the amount of approximately $0.7 million when the loan funds. Both the loan origination fees and the upfront facility fee will be amortized over the term of the loan beginning on the initial funding date.
The carrying values of the short- and long-term debt instruments approximate their fair values as of December 31, 2011.

From time to time, the Company may enter into letters of credit or provide bank guarantees to third parties. Generally, these arrangements require the Company to set aside cash in support of the potential obligation, which the Company recognizes as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet. For example, as of December 31, 2011, the Company has provided a bank guarantee relating to its proposed Ashalim project for which the Company has set aside approximately $4.0 million in restricted cash. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the Company did not have any material off balance sheet financing arrangements other than those relating to operating leases which are described in further detail in Note 15.

8. CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE
In May 2010, the Company received proceeds of $15.5 million through the issuance of a convertible note payable to ALSTOM Power Inc. (“Alstom”). In August 2010, in connection with Alstom’s investment in the Company’s Series D financing, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Alstom triggering an automatic conversion of the note. As a result of contractual provisions and a pre-defined ownership percentage, the Company repaid Alstom approximately $2.7 million in principal and accrued interest, and the remainder of the note was converted into 1,908,831 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series D. The forgiveness of unpaid accrued interest of $0.3 million was credited to additional paid in capital. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the Company had no convertible notes payable outstanding.

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants
In August 2006, the Company raised $500,000 by issuing convertible notes and a certain number of preferred stock purchase warrants to investors. On October 24, 2006, all of the notes, along with accrued interest, were converted into Convertible Preferred Stock Series A. The preferred stock warrant agreement entitles the warrant holders to purchase from the Company 60,387 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series A at $2.07 per share, at any time on or after the date of the next financing of more than $10,000,000, and on or prior to the expiration date, which is the earlier of (i) August 28, 2011, (ii) sale of the Company, or (iii) the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”), all as further defined under the warrant agreements terms. The issuance of the warrant resulted in an increase to additional paid-in capital of $72,543, representing the estimated fair market value of the preferred warrants. A corresponding amount, representing a discount on the convertible debt, has been amortized over the life of the debt. In November 2011, the Company’s Board approved an amendment to extend the exercise period for the warrants to December 15, 2011.
On December 7, 2011, VantagePoint Capital Partners funds exercised their warrants and paid an exercise price of approximately $0.1 million. In connection with the amendment, the Company recognized a loss of approximately $0.5 million representing the difference in the fair value of the warrants immediately before and after the modification to the warrant agreement. The Company calculated the fair value of the warrants on the date of issue using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility 90%, expected term of approximately two months, risk-free interest rate of 2.07% and dividend yield of 0%. The $0.5 million loss was recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended 2011.

In December 2010, in connection with the Term Loan (Note 7), the Company issued fully paid and non-assessable warrants. The number of warrants issued is equal to the quotient derived by dividing (i) $875,000 prior to June 30, 2011 or (ii) $1,750,000 on or after June 30, 2011 if the Company has not paid the outstanding obligations in full by June 30, 2011, by the exercise price. The exercise price, at the warrant holder’s option, is at a price equal to either (i) $6.7246 per share if the warrant is exercised for shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series D or (ii) the price per share paid in the next institutional equity financing of the Company prior to an IPO. These warrants are exercisable for a period ending upon the earlier to occur of (i) five years from the Effective Date; (ii) three years after the Initial Public Offering; or (iii) a Merger Event in which the holders of the Preferred Stock receive cash or freely publicly tradable securities in such transaction. The Company calculated the fair value of the warrants on the date of issue under the assumption that the warrants would be exercisable for Convertible Preferred Stock Series D (most dilutive) or 130,119 shares using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility 91%, expected term of five years, risk-free interest rate of 2.18% and dividend yield of 0%. The Company recorded the issuance date fair value of the warrants under the with-and-without method resulting in an amount of $0.8 million recorded in long-term liabilities as a discount to the Term Loan proceeds. The fair value of the warrant liability is measured each reporting period and any changes in fair value are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
Series E Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants
In connection with the Company’s issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock Series E, the Company issued warrants to purchase 195,653 shares of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock Series E at an exercise price of $8.6646 per share to the placement agent, see Note 11. The warrants are exercisable immediately and expires five years from the effective date. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants as of the date of issuance to be $1,199,000 which was recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the Convertible Preferred Stock Series E. The fair value on the grant date was based on the contractual term of the warrants of five years, a weighted average risk-free interest rate of 2.14%, expected volatility of 91% and 0% expected dividend yield. The Company has recorded the Series E warrants in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as the underlying stock of the Series E warrants, the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock Series E, has a contingent conversion feature, which could potentially result in the Company issuing a variable number of shares to the Series E warrant holders upon exercise of the warrants. The fair value of the warrant liability is measured each reporting period and any changes in fair value are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
The Company recorded the change in fair value of the Series D and Series E convertible preferred stock warrants in the amount of $0, $0 and $0.9 million gain for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The 2011 gain was offset by a $0.5 million loss recognized for the amendment to the Series A convertible preferred stock warrants, as discussed above. These amounts are included in “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
In 2011, the Company estimated the fair value of the warrants using a combination of the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the probability weighted expected return method, or PWERM, which considers several mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive potential liquidity outcomes and assigns probabilities to each.
For each of the possible events, a range of future equity values was estimated, based on market, income and/or cost approaches over a range of possible event dates, all plus or minus a standard deviation for value and timing. For each equity and value scenario, the rights and preferences of each

stockholder class were considered in order to determine the appropriate allocation of value to common shares. To estimate the warrant value for each scenario involving an initial public offering, a Black-Scholes option pricing model was used based on the estimated common share value for such exit event. For all other scenarios, the intrinsic value of the warrant was used. The value of each common share was then multiplied by a discount factor derived from the calculated discount rate and the expected timing of the event. A risk-adjusted discount rate was applied as the probability weightings in the PWERM address the success rates of each scenario. The value per common share, taking into account sensitivities to the timing of the event, was then multiplied by an estimated probability for each of the possible events. The calculated value per common share under the private company scenario was then discounted for the lack of marketability. A probability-weighted value per share of common stock is then determined. Similarly, the warrant values estimated for each scenario were probability-weighted and discounted to the present.
The assumptions used in the fair value estimate for a given scenario were as follows:

  	 	0.4% - 0.7	%

In 2007, the Company issued approximately 3.0 million shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series A at a price of $2.07 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $6.3 million.
In 2007, the Company issued approximately 7.3 million shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series B at a price of $4.12 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $29.9 million.
In 2008, the Company issued approximately 15.0 million shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series C at a price of $7.65 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $114.5 million.
In 2010, the Company issued approximately 25.8 million shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series D at a price of $6.7246 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $148.5 million. The total issuance costs for Series D was $4.4 million, including placement fees of approximately $3.6 million.
In addition, existing holders of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock, in consideration for, purchasing shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock Series D greater than the preferred stockholders pro-rata shares of stock at the first closing of Series D, were issued approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock. Two shares of common stock were issued for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock Series D purchased in excess of the number required to maintain the preferred stockholders’ pro-rata holdings. The total number of common shares issued was determined by dividing the number of preferred shares outstanding immediately after the first Series D closing. In determining the proceeds attributable to the common shares issued in conjunction with the pro-rata Convertible Preferred Stock Series D the Company allocated the proceeds received using the relative fair value method, taking into account the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of issuance as well as the fair value of the Convertible Preferred Stock Series D. This resulted in an allocation of $20.6 million of proceeds being attributed to the issued common shares from the Series D proceeds.
In December 2010, the Company issued approximately 3.1 million shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series E at a price of $8.6646 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $27.1 million.
In December 2010, the Company entered into an agreement (“Placement Agreement”) with a placement agent (“Placement Agent”) to assist the Company in obtaining financing through a private placement of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock Series E. Under the terms of this agreement, as compensation for its placement services, the Placement Agent was to receive as compensation a fee based on a percentage of gross proceeds invested by the Placement Agent’s investors, (ii) a warrant to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock Series E equal to percentage of the number of shares of such preferred stock invested by the Placement Agent, investors and (iii) a one-time expense fee of $150,000 once a minimum aggregate investment was met. In 2010, the Company did not receive any Series E proceeds as a result of the Placement Agreement.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company issued 20.0 million shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series E for $170.9 million in proceeds, net of $2.0 million in issuance costs including placement fees of approximately $1.8 million to the Placement Agent as described above. Additionally, in 2011, the Company issued 60,387 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock Series A for approximately $0.1 million in proceeds.

*	See discussion below regarding dilutive events
The Company performs assessments of all terms and features of its convertible preferred stock in order to identify any potential embedded features that would require bifurcation or any beneficial conversion features. As part of this analysis, the Company assessed the economic characteristics and risks of its convertible preferred stock, including conversion, liquidation and redemption features (if any), as well as dividend and voting rights. Based on the Company’s determination that each series of its convertible preferred stock is an “equity host,” the Company determined that the features of the convertible preferred stock are most closely associated with an equity host, and, although the convertible preferred stock includes conversion features, such conversion features do not require bifurcation as a derivative liability.
The Company also determined that the Convertible Preferred Stock Series E, while issued at a fixed amount, has a contingent conversion option upon a qualified IPO event which could result in a potential beneficial conversion feature. The Company evaluated the possibility of a beneficial conversion at the issuance date of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock by comparing the fair value of the Company’s common stock on issuance date as compared to the contingent adjusted

Table of Contents

conversion price of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had not recognized the impact of the beneficial conversion feature in its consolidated financial statements as the contingent event had not occurred through that date. The Company has determined that based on an assumed IPO price of $22.00 per share, which represents the midpoint of the estimated price range for the Company’s expected IPO, the Series E Convertible Preferred Stockholders would receive an additional 3,671,144 common shares (plus the 7,697,621 common shares they were previously entitled to) upon conversion of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock. Such additional common shares would trigger the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature of approximately $41.1 million which would be treated as a deemed dividend. This deemed dividend would be recorded as a charge within the equity section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and would increase net loss per share in the quarter in which the offering is completed. The actual deemed dividend will be dependent on the final IPO price.
The Convertible Preferred Stock Series E is classified outside of stockholders’ equity as the Convertible Preferred Stock Series E shares contain contingent conversion features that upon a qualified IPO event could result in the Company issuing a variable number of shares to the Series E holders. The pricing of the Company’s common stock upon a qualified IPO event is considered not solely within the control of the Company.
Conversions are automatic upon the closing of a qualified IPO with aggregate proceeds of at least $50,000,000 (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) or upon the agreement of a majority of the holders of then outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting as a single class.
Liquidation—In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding down of the Company, the holders of all series of convertible preferred stock are entitled to any declared but unpaid dividends, over holders of common stock.

12. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS
2006 Stock Plan—In October 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the 2006 Stock Plan. The 2006 Stock Plan provides for the granting of incentive and non-statutory stock options to employees, officers, directors, and nonemployees of the Company. Incentive stock options may be granted with exercise prices not less than fair value, and non-statutory stock options may be granted with an exercise price not less than 85% of the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock granted to a stockholder owning more than 10% of voting stock of the Company may be granted with an exercise price of not less than 110% of the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant until the common stock is a listed security, at which point the exercise price of such grant shall be not less than 100% of the fair value. The 2006 Stock Plan will automatically terminate in 2016, unless sooner terminated at the discretion of management with the approval of the board of directors. Options granted under the plan shall have a term of no more than 10 years. In the case of options granted to a stockholder owning more than 10% of voting stock of the Company, the term shall be no more than five years.
Employee and nonemployee grants generally vest over a period of 4 to 5 years with a maximum contractual term of generally 10 years.

The Company recognized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances. Excess tax benefits from exercise of stock options, if any, are presented as financing cash flows.
As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately $20.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost (after estimated forfeitures) related to outstanding stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.6 years. Future option grants will increase the amount of share-based compensation expense to be recorded in these periods.

Employee Share-Based Compensation—During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company granted 319,533, 986,936 and 847,983, respectively, stock options to employees with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $9.48, $14.25, and $18.18 per share, respectively. Share-based compensation related to options granted to employees was $1.3 million, $2.1 million and $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011.
Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees are as follows:

Nonemployee Share-Based Compensation—During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company granted options to purchase 15,820, 71,329 and 21,200, shares of common stock, respectively, to nonemployees with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $10.05, $14.34 and $19.29 per share, respectively. Share-based compensation related to options granted to nonemployees was $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011.

Fair Value Assumptions
Risk-Free Interest Rate—The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
Expected Term—The Company estimated the expected term, which represents its best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that it expected the stock options to remain outstanding, of all of its stock options that qualify for such estimation using the simplified method, as provided under authoritative guidance. The simplified method is calculated as the average of the time to vest and the contractual life of the options. The Company deemed it appropriate to use the simplified method as the Company has limited operating experience and share option exercise experience.
Expected Volatility—Since the Company is a private entity with no historical data regarding the volatility of its common stock, the expected volatility used is based on volatility of similar publicly listed companies in comparable industries. In evaluating similarity, the Company considered factors, such as industry, stage of life cycle and market capitalization.
Dividend Yield—The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not plan to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the valuation model.

Table of Contents

Fair Value of Common Stock—The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options has historically been determined by the board of directors with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists who, due to the lack of a public market for the Company’s common stock, have considered factors including valuation of comparable companies, sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties, operating and financial performance, and trends in the broader solar industry in their valuations. The fair market value of the underlying common stock will be determined by the board of directors until such time as the Company’s common stock is listed on an established exchange.
Forfeiture Rate—The Company estimates its forfeiture rate based on an analysis of its actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. The impact from a forfeiture rate adjustment will be recognized in the period of adjustment, and if the actual number of forfeitures differs from the estimate, the Company may be required to record an amount to share-based compensation expense in future periods.
Each of the inputs discussed above is subjective and generally requires significant management judgment to determine.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes, as well as operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the favorable tax attributes in future tax returns, the Company has placed a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $102.3 million of federal, $95.8 million of California and $35.0 million of international available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in 2027 for federal and 2017 for California purposes. The $35.0 million of international net operating loss carryforwards may be carried indefinitely, subject to certain limitations.
As a result of certain realization requirements of ASC Topic 718, the table of deferred tax assets and liabilities shown above does not include certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011 that arose directly from (or the use of which was postponed by) tax deductions related to equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting. Equity will be increased by $0.5 million if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized. The Company uses ASC Topic 740 ordering for purposes of determining when excess tax benefits have been realized.
As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $2.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $0.17 million would affect its effective tax rate as the tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits are based on the recognition and measurement criteria of FASB ASC Topic 740. The Company’s policy is to recognize any interest and penalties that it might incur related to its tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company did not accrue any potential penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible its unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months for tax positions that have been taken, or that may be taken, for periods through December 31, 2011. The Company files income tax returns in

the United States, California, various states, and Israel. Tax years 2007 through 2011 remain subject to examination for federal and state purposes.

Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event the Company has such a change in ownership, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards could be restricted.
The Company does not have undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2011. Therefore, no provision is required on the Company’s undistributed earnings.
15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Product Warranties—The Company generally provides warranties related to its solar thermal supply projects for a period of up to forty-eight months from the date of the project’s substantial completion. The underlying equipment purchased by the Company also has a manufacturer’s warranty which is generally for one year. The Company recognized $0, $0 and $8.3 million of warranty expense in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Warranty expense for 2011 is primarily comprised of the $6.5 million warranty expense recognized for the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project as discussed in Note 2 and $1.9 million of warranty expense for Ivanpah. Amounts recorded for the Ivanpah project and $0.2 million of the Coalinga amounts are based on 1% of the revenues recognized and represent the Company’s best estimate of future warranty costs post delivery of the project.

For the Ivanpah project, the Company has retained extended warranty insurance coverage, which provides for a reimbursement of the cost for the repair or replacement of parts resulting from certain product defects. The Company has prepaid approximately $6.8 million of the insurance premiums relating to this coverage. These amounts are included in “Prepaid and other current assets” or “Other assets” within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011.
Financial Guarantees—In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements with third parties under which the Company guarantees the performance of its subsidiaries related to certain service contracts, which may include services such as development, engineering, procurement of equipment, construction management and monitoring and maintenance.
 
F-41
Table of Contents

As a result of the Company’s 2011 Ivanpah Transaction on April 5, 2011 as described in Note 5, the Company has provided the following guarantees:
Solar Field Guarantees—The Company’s subsidiaries have entered into solar field agreements and solar field supply contracts to provide equipment, technology and services to Ivanpah. Under these contracts, the Company has provided guarantees to support potential delivery and performance damages. The maximum potential amount payable under these guarantees is $165.0 million. The Company accounts for these guarantees under the contingent liability model and related amounts, if any, would be included in the company’s estimated costs to complete. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has not recorded any liability for performance and delivery related guarantees as no potential claims against these guarantees have been identified as being probable.
The Company is required to place cash or common stock in escrow of $108.6 million to support a portion of any potential payments under these guarantees. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has funded into this escrow approximately $83.0 million for these guarantees which are currently included in “Restricted cash—Noncurrent” in the consolidated balance sheet and reserved (but not issued) 2,454,590 shares of common stock. Approximately 30% of this escrow is reserved to cover potential delay damages and is subject to release upon completion of the Company’s solar field supply obligations. The remainder will be released upon determination that system performance and warranty obligations are either not payable because there are no claims or, if there are claims, they are paid directly by the Company rather than out of the escrow. The timing of any release of performance related escrows from these funds will be determined based upon by completion of the ramp-up period for each of the three Ivanpah project companies associated with Ivanpah HoldCo, which occurs over the first three years of operations of each of the three project phases.
Cost Overrun Funding—To the extent the costs of construction of Ivanpah exceed an amount equal to the contingency included in the base equity contribution obligations, the Company and the other equity owners have agreed to fund a 3% overrun contingency or approximately $66.5 million, of the amount, the Company has committed to fund $14.5 million. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has funded approximately $1.9 million towards this overrun contingency reserve. In the event the base equity and funded overrun equity is insufficient to complete the Ivanpah project, the Company must fund all further cost overruns until the Ivanpah projects construction is completed, except to the extent the risk of such construction costs are borne by the contractors under fixed-price contracts. The Company accounts for the cost overrun funding commitment under the fair value model.
The Company has evaluated the construction budgets for those areas that might be impacted by potential project delays or other cost drivers to determine the nature and amounts of any overruns that might be reasonably anticipated on a project of this size and nature. Based upon this analysis, the Company believes that the cost overrun will be less than the $57 million base contingency and the $66 million funded overrun, or $123.0 million, although there can be no assurance that the final amount will not differ. A probability based approach was used to estimate the fair value of this guarantee. Significant assumptions utilized in this estimate include estimated monetary values associated with cost overruns and assumptions regarding the probability of alternative cost outcomes. Based upon this analysis and management estimates the Company has recorded a liability in the amount of approximately $0.3 million as of December 31, 2011. This estimate is subject to change as actual cost and additional information becomes available. Any future increases in the liability would reduce profitability (or increase losses).
Treasury Cash Grant and ITC Indemnity Obligations—The Company has guaranteed certain indemnity obligations to ensure it takes no action that would cause the Treasury Cash Grant to be recaptured by the IRS. This can occur if certain prohibited ownership transfers are made or if investment tax credits are claimed in violation of the loan and funding agreements. The Company, as well as other investors in Ivanpah HoldCo, have each guaranteed these obligations to ensure that, in
 
F-42
Table of Contents

the event an investor should take an action causing such an event to occur, the other investors would be made whole for the loss of the grant. Since the obligation is contingent on the sale of the Company’s equity interest in Ivanpah HoldCo to unqualified defined buyers, this is considered to be within the control of the Company and no amounts have been accrued through December 31, 2011.
Also, if the Treasury Cash Grant is significantly lower than expected such that the DOE’s “debt service reserve” is not funded by the Treasury Cash Grant proceeds, the Company would be required to fund its proportionate share of this debt service reserve, or approximately $57.0 million, with its own cash. The Company is permitted to use up to $32.7 million of the Company’s common stock (subject to a maximum of 1,605,793 shares) to bridge funding gaps if it should so elect. The Company has funded $25.0 million as security for the Treasury Grant and ITC Indemnity Obligations, which is recorded in restricted cash, long-term and reserved, but not issued, approximately 1,605,793 shares of common stock.
Bechtel Deferred Payment Guarantee: Bechtel has agreed to defer payments to be received for services rendered to Ivanpah HoldCo of $10 million until payment related to the Treasury Cash Grant is received. If the Treasury Cash Grant is not received by Ivanpah HoldCo the Company has guaranteed the $10 million payment to Bechtel. The Company has determined the fair value of the guarantee to be approximately $0.2 million as of December 31, 2011. The Company has the right to recover any payment made under this guarantee from Ivanpah HoldCo.
The Company estimated the fair value based on the published default rates for corporate bonds of companies with similar credit ratings and tenors.
Indemnifications—The Company, as permitted under Delaware law, and in accordance with its amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while the officer or director is or was serving at the Company’s request in such capacity. The duration of these indemnifications, commitments, and guarantees varies and, in certain cases, is indefinite. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited, however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. The Company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company accrues for losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from indemnification provisions, when future payment is probable. No such losses have been recorded to date.
Severance Plan—The Company’s foreign subsidiary provides limited non-pension benefits to all current employees who are entitled to benefits in the event of termination or retirement in accordance with the government sponsored programs. These plans generally obligate the Company to pay one month’s salary per year of service to employees in the event of involuntary termination. There is no limit on the number of years of service in the calculation of the benefit obligation. The liabilities for these plans are accounted for using what is commonly referred to as the “shut down” method, where a company records the undiscounted obligation as if it were payable at each balance sheet date. Such liabilities have been presented among “Accrued and other current liabilities,” in the consolidated balance sheets as presented in the table below. Amounts accumulated in the foreign insurance companies are not under the control of the Company, accordingly the amount included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets also under “Accrued and other current liabilities,” represents the unfunded portion.

The aggregate value of these foreign insurance policies as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 was $1.8 million, and $2.5 million, respectively. Severance expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 was $0.5 million, $0.8 million, and $1.2 million, respectively.
Operating Leases—The Company leases certain real property under non-cancelable operating lease agreements in Coalinga and Oakland, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona; Jerusalem and Rotem, Israel. In addition, the Company has entered into apartment leases and vehicle operating lease agreements. These leases require the Company to pay common area maintenance and certain other costs in addition to base rent. In 2011, the Company expanded its leased space in Oakland, California and Israel.

Land Lease Commitments—In the normal course of business the Company enters into land options and lease agreements with third parties to evaluate land for the development of potential solar thermal projects. The land option agreements typically are non-refundable and provide the Company with preliminary site access to perform basic evaluation studies. The land lease agreements provide the Company with expanded access to evaluate the suitability of the site, evaluate property rights, and the ability to perform additional activities to assess the commercial viability of the site. Such activities include, but are not limited to, conducting surveys and other analyses; assessing transmission options; assessing the availability of resources; obtaining clearances from local, federal and other regulatory agencies; and other assessments that are necessary to determine a site is viable. The Company’s typically structures land lease agreements to allow the ability to terminate the lease agreement after a certain period of time if it is determined that the site does not satisfy the Company’s needs.
In October 2010, the Company obtained a Record of Decision (“ROD”) from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) for the Company’s Ivanpah Group. The ROD provides the Ivanpah Group with all of the necessary federal permits to commence construction of the solar thermal facility. As part of the ROD, the Company provided a project performance bond in the amount of $0.4 million, to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions as set forth in the ROD. This bond is classified as a
 
F-44
Table of Contents

long-term deposit on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010. The project performance bond must be maintained in effect until removal of improvements or restoration of the ROD has been accepted by the BLM.
In April 2011, the Company closed the financing of Ivanpah HoldCo with third parties and the DOE, as guarantor, and as a result of this transaction the ROD for Ivanpah HoldCo ceased to be the primary obligation of the Company.
The Company recognized land option payments for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, of $0.9 million, $2.0 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company recognized land lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, of $0.1 million, $3.4 million, and $4.9 million, respectively. In 2011, the Company canceled one of its land leases for a development site in Arizona and as a result, incurred lease termination fees of approximately $3.0 million. These fees are included in land lease expense for 2011. As of December 31, 2011, future minimum rent payments for land leases and options were immaterial.
Power Purchase Agreements—Southern California Edison (“SCE”)—In February 2009, with certain amendments in 2010, entered into a set of agreements related to the development of solar thermal projects with SCE, the output of which will be sold to SCE. All of the PPAs were at market rates when originally entered into with SCE. One of the original PPAs entered into in 2009 was associated with Ivanpah HoldCo and as a result of the 2011 Ivanpah Transaction in April 2011, is no longer the primary obligation of the Company. In October 2011, the Company executed five amended and restated PPAs with SCE. These PPAs were submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) for approval in November 2011; as of December 31, 2011, all five PPAs were pending approval by the CPUC. The Company agreed to post and to maintain a security deposit (“seller security”) during the development and construction phase of the solar projects. As a result of the amendment and restatement of the five PPAs in 2011, total seller security deposits will be approximately $65.0 million. The Company has posted $32.7 million, or 50%, of the required total as of December 31, 2011. The Company will be required to post the remaining 50% of the seller security deposits upon CPUC approval of the PPAs.
As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the Company has recorded $4.6 million and $32.7 million, respectively, of the total seller security deposit requirement under long-term deposits in the consolidated balance sheets.
Power Purchase Agreements—Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“PG&E”)—In April 2009, with certain amendments in 2010, seven of the Company negotiated with PG&E to rescind and replace the set of agreements (collectively, the “PG&E Agreement”) originally entered into in March 2008. These agreements are related to solar thermal projects, the output of which will be sold to PG&E. All of the PG&E Agreements were at market rates when they were originally entered into with PG&E, and all seven PG&E Agreements have been approved by the CPUC.
Under the amended agreements, the Company has agreed to certain pricing changes for future energy output and to post and maintain security deposits during the development and construction phase of the solar projects. Security is to be posted in tranches based upon the achievement of certain milestones, the first of which being the signing of the new PG&E Agreement. The security is to be released as of the commercial operation date of each project provided no damages are owed to PG&E.
As of December 31, 2010, and 2011, $9.1 million and $18.0 million, respectively, is recorded as restricted cash – long-term for the project development security.
Two of the above PPAs are associated with Ivanpah HoldCo, and as a result of the 2011 Ivanpah Transaction in April 2011 as described in Note 5, are no longer the primary obligations of the Company.

In connection with the PG&E Agreement, the Company’s wholly-owned foreign subsidiary entered into a royalty agreement with PG&E, guaranteed by the Company pursuant to which the Company’s foreign subsidiary has agreed to pay certain royalties to PG&E, up to a maximum of $20.0 million, on sales of its integrated solar field system and licenses of its solar field technology. No royalty shall be due with respect to sales of its integrated solar field systems and licenses of its solar field technology as part of the first 100 megawatts of electrical generating capacity of a single project to be designated by the Company’s foreign subsidiary and PG&E. Royalties will accrue on sales of the solar field systems and licenses of its solar field technology upon the first commercial operation date of the project described above.
Purchase Commitments—The Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 has outstanding purchase orders and contracts for goods and services in the amount of $1.7 billion and $236.0 million primarily related to the supply of the projects associated with Ivanpah HoldCo, construction of the Coalinga Solar-to-Steam for EOR project, development activities related to future projects, and general purchase orders for goods and services.

Department of Energy Loan Guarantee—Term Sheet—In February 2010, the United States Department of Energy announced that it had conditionally committed to provide up to $1.37 billion in loan guarantees to support the Ivanpah Group. Under the loan guarantee, the Ivanpah Group was required to meet certain conditions precedent prior the financial close of the loan guarantee. The Company’s Ivanpah Group has recorded in noncurrent assets approximately $7.3 million, in loan guarantee issuance costs, which represents third parties’ due diligence procedures for the loan guarantee as well as DOE facility fees.
In April 2011, the Company closed the financing of Ivanpah HoldCo with third parties and the DOE, as guarantor, and as a result of this transaction the above DOE term sheet for the Ivanpah Group ceased to be the primary obligation of the Company. See Note 5 for additional details.
Legal Matters—The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, wholly-owned project companies, and affiliates are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of
 
F-46
Table of Contents

business, the Company may be named as parties in a number of claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company can incur penalties for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.
The Company records a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates the range of reasonably estimated costs and records a liability based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. These accruals, and the estimates of any additional reasonably possible losses, are reviewed quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In assessing such contingencies, the Company’s policy is to exclude anticipated legal costs. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 the Company has not recorded any accrued liability for legal matters. While there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding or other loss contingencies involving the Company, management does not believe any pending matters will be resolved in a manner that would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has adopted a defined contribution retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers all U.S.-based employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company’s contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the board of directors. There have been no contributions by the Company through December 31, 2011.
17. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company operates in one reportable segment, the design, building and selling of large scale solar thermal systems using the Company’s proprietary solar power technology. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the CEO, who reviews consolidated operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.
The Company’s revenues consist of revenues to customers in the United States.

18. NET LOSS PER SHARE
The Company applies the two-class method for calculating and presenting net income or loss per share. Under the two-class method of computing earnings per share, net income attributable to common stockholders is computed by an adjustment to subtract from net income the portion of current year earnings that the preferred shareholders would have been entitled to receive pursuant to their dividend rights had all of the year’s earnings been distributed. No such adjustment to earnings is made
 
F-47
Table of Contents

during periods with a net loss, as the holders of the convertible preferred shares had no obligation to fund losses. Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus, for periods with net income attributable to common stock, the dilutive effects of stock options. Given the Company has a net loss, the results would be antidilutive for all periods presented.
The Company’s basic net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the Company’s net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock used to calculate the Company’s
basic net loss per share of common stock excludes those shares subject to repurchase related to stock options that were exercised prior to vesting as these shares are not deemed to be issued for accounting purposes until they vest. The diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities, including stock options, restricted stock, warrants and convertible preferred stock. The Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for all periods presented as the inclusion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding was anti-dilutive.
The following table summarizes the Company’s calculation of historical basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to BrightSource Energy, Inc. common stockholders (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):

The Company accounted for the reserves under the guidance for earnings per share, which states that contingently issuable shares shall be included in the computation of basic earnings per share when all of the necessary conditions of the contingency have been met and the shares are deemed issued. As of December 31, 2011, none of the Ivanpah Reserves have been issued.

19. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
As indicated in Note 4, in October 2006, the Company entered into the LAAS Assignment Agreement. LAAS is a major stockholder of the Company and is in turn owned by Arnold J. Goldman, the Company’s Chairman Emeritus and founder, and immediate members of his family.
In October 2006, the Company entered into an employment agreement with John Woolard, the Company’s chief executive officer (“CEO”). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Mr. Woolard may devote no more than 5% of his business time to VantagePoint Capital Partners, a stockholder of the Company, as a venture partner.
In October 2009, the Company entered into an asset acquisition transaction with MSBS for its 50% interest in SPII. MSBS is an investor in the Company and holds equity interest in Series B, Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result of this acquisition, the Company has assumed the liability of the development loan payable to MSBS. The amount of the loan payable was approximately $3.1 million as of December 31, 2010. The amount of interest payable was approximately $0.8 million as of December 31, 2010. In April 2011, the Company closed the financing of Ivanpah HoldCo with third parties and, as a result of this transaction, the development loan ceased to be the primary obligation of the Company. See Note 5 for additional details.
In August 2010, the Company signed a business partnership and preferred equipment supplier agreement with Alstom, a stockholder in the Company. The business partnership is to jointly market and bid on projects to develop and construct solar thermal facilities in Northern Africa, South Africa and Southern Europe. In December 2010, concurrent with an investment in the Series E financing, the Company amended and restated its preferred equipment supply agreement and its business partnership was further expanded to include certain countries in the Middle East. In August 2011, the partnership was further expanded to include India. The preferred equipment supplier agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which the Company would designate Alstom as its preferred suppliers of equipment for certain designated projects utilizing the Company’s solar systems technology. On August 23, 2011, the Company signed a letter agreement regarding the design and
 
F-49
Table of Contents

development of such subcritical solar receivers. The letter agreement sets forth the development program, schedule and project organization and terminates upon completion of the development program. Currently, the business partnership and preferred equipment supplier agreement has no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In April 2011, the Company completed the financing of Ivanpah HoldCo as discussed in Note 5. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company entered into a series of fixed price solar thermal supply and services contracts with this related party. This investment represented an ownership of approximately 14% of the voting interest in Ivanpah HoldCo and was the Company’s only equity interest in that entity. The Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control of, the entity, and therefore the Company accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting. The Company eliminates any intercompany profits or losses in relation to its continuing involvement with Ivanpah HoldCo proportionate to its retained equity interest. Amounts related to the 2011 Ivanpah Transaction are disclosed in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations as related party in 2011.
In November 2011, the Company amended its warrant agreement with VantagePoint Capital Partners for the purchase of Convertible Preferred Stock Series A, extending the exercise period of the warrants to December 15, 2011. On December 7, 2011, VantagePoint Capital Partners exercised the warrants for an exercise price of approximately $0.1 million and received 20,129 shares of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock Series A.
20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through March 30, 2012, the date on which these consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.
The Company’s board of directors approved and adopted the 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan and 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which will both become effective upon the completion of the initial public offering of the Company’s common stock. The Company has 4,333,333 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in relation to these plans.
On January 23, 2012, the Company entered into two master services contracts for engineering and home office services related to the Company’s Hidden Hills Ranch and Rio Mesa Solar projects. The master services contracts provide for total payments of approximately $168.0 million for these services, for the two projects, which will be payable pursuant to a fixed progress payment schedule of approximately $28.4 million in 2012, $84.9 million in 2013, $41.0 million in 2014, $11.1 million in 2015 and $2.6 million in 2016. These payments may be subject to holdbacks by the Company as deemed necessary to ensure performance under the agreement. Additionally, the Company may suspend or even terminate the contracts at its sole discretion upon written notice.
In February 2012, the Company was relieved of its $3.0 million obligation for the Project Power Book, as discussed in Note 4. The Company will recognize this deferred gain on a straight-line basis beginning in 2012 and ending in 2016.
In March 2012, the Company’s Board of Director’s approved grants of 318,805 stock options at an exercise price of $22.02 per share and 15,000 shares of restricted common stock to employees.
In March 2012, the Company entered into stock purchase agreements with Alstom and Caithness, pursuant to which Alstom and Caithness will purchase $65.0 million and $10.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively, at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price, in private placements subsequent to the closing of the Company’s initial public offering.

Additionally, the Company amended its preferred equipment supply agreement with Alstom to expand the number of preferred supply projects and signed letter agreements regarding the design and development of supercritical solar receivers and steam turbine generators.
In March 2012, the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement was amended to allow the Company to borrow the additional $10.0 million, as described in Note 7, either prior to or after the closing of a Qualified IPO. Additionally, the Agreement was amended to indicate that should Hercules opt for a cash payment in lieu of common stock warrants in the event the Company does not complete a Qualified IPO before March 30, 2012, the Company would not be required to pay the amount until the loan’s maturity date. On March 23, 2012, the Company borrowed the additional $10 million.
In March 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock which will become effective prior to the Company’s initial public offering. All share and per share data referenced throughout the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock and the resulting 1-for-3 conversion ratio adjustment to the Company’s convertible preferred stock (including the preferred stock that the preferred stock warrants are exercisable into). On March 23, 2012, the 1-for-3 reverse split of the Company’s common stock became effective.

Item 14.	Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a corporation’s board of directors to grant, and authorizes a court to award, indemnity to officers, directors and other corporate agents.
As permitted by Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the registrant’s certificate of incorporation to be in effect upon the completion of this offering includes provisions that eliminate the personal liability of its directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty as directors. To the extent Section 102(b)(7) is interpreted, or the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended, to allow similar protections for officers of a corporation, such provisions of the registrant’s certificate of incorporation shall also extend to those persons.
In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the bylaws of the registrant to be effective upon completion of this offering provide that:
 
 	Ÿ	 	
The registrant shall indemnify its directors and officers for serving the registrant in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at the registrant’s request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
The registrant may, in its discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
The registrant is required to advance expenses, as incurred, to its directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such director or officer shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 
II-1
Table of Contents

 	Ÿ	 	
The registrant will not be obligated pursuant to the bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person, except with respect to proceedings authorized by the registrant’s board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.

 
 	Ÿ	 	
The rights conferred in the bylaws are not exclusive, and the registrant is authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with its directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.

The registrant’s policy is to enter into separate indemnification agreements with each of its directors and officers that provide the maximum indemnity allowed to directors and executive officers by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and also provides for certain additional procedural protections. The registrant’s directors who are affiliated with venture capital firms also have certain rights to indemnification provided by their venture capital funds and the affiliates of those funds (the “Fund Indemnitors”). In the event that any claim is asserted against the Fund Indemnitors that arises solely from the status or conduct of these directors in their capacity as directors of the registrant, the registrant has agreed, subject to stockholder approval, to indemnify the Fund Indemnitors to the extent of any such claims. The registrant also maintains directors and officers insurance to insure such persons against certain liabilities. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
These indemnification provisions and the indemnification agreements entered into between the registrant and its officers and directors may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of the registrant’s officers and directors for liabilities (including reimbursement of expenses incurred) arising under the Securities Act of 1933.
The underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement provides for indemnification by the underwriters of the registrant and its officers and directors for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 and otherwise.

4. Concurrent Private Placements
 
 	Ÿ	 	
In March 2012, the registrant entered into stock purchase agreements with Alstom and Caithness, pursuant to which Alstom and Caithness will purchase $65.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, of the registrant’s common stock, at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price, in private placements subsequent to the closing of offering.

None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering, and the registrant believes the transactions were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on Section 4(2) thereof, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or, in the case of options and common stock issuances described above, Regulation S thereunder, or Rule 701 thereunder, as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering or transactions pursuant to compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation as provided under such Rule 701. The recipients of securities in such transactions represented their intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were affixed to the share certificates and instruments issued in such transactions. All recipients of securities pursuant to Items 1, 2 and 4 above were accredited or sophisticated and either received adequate information about the registrant or had access, through their relationships with the registrant, to such information.
 
Item 16.	Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules
 
 	(a)	Exhibits
The list of exhibits is set forth under “Exhibit Index” at the end of the registration statement and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
 	(b)	Financial Statement Schedules
Schedules have been omitted because the information required to be set forth therein is not applicable or is shown in the registrant’s consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.

Item 17.	Undertakings
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:
(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.
(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
(3) For the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, if the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.
(4) For the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:
(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;
 
II-4
Table of Contents

(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;
(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
