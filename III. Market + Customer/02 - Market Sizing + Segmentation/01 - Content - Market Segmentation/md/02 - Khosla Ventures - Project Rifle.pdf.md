1 RIFLE overview
2 RIFLE in action: Market strategy analysis
3 Expansion strategy
4 Financial services segmentation and targeting
5 An example of RIFLE in practice


RIFLE is a quantified decision
making framework 
Appropriate for major decisions
• Provides a rigorous means of prioritizing among similar options
• Done well, RIFLE leads to improved decisions that are broadly supported
• In general, involves 100+ hours of work and expensive resources per use



Rifle improves do-or-die market decisions
INTUITION 
RIFLE ANALYSIS
MARKET RIFLE
What market segments should we be in?
Focus on top 2,000 accounts; expand to complementary markets
Narrow focus to 30 of top 200; stay in core market for 2+ years
ACCOUNT RIFLE
Which accounts should we target?
Great financial services targets:
[Company 1], [Company 2]
None of the above are appropriate:
better are [Company 3], [Company 4]
CHANNEL RIFLE
What channel strategy, what partners?
Leverage large existing sales forces of channel partners to expand sales
Direct sales assisted by partners much more likely to succeed

Market strategy analysis
• Establish clear alternatives
• Establish targeting and prioritization framework
• Get buy-in on the framework; know how it will be applied
• Execute the analysis and don’t screw it up!


Targeting the right market segments
Market RIFLE methodology summary
• Goal #1: Market leadership
• Goal #2: Expand in a disciplined, highly leveraged way
• Goal #3: Identify and exploit network effects


Quantitative market comparison
“RIFLE-izing” key characteristics
• Evaluate and score each market on these six characteristics
• Use simple 0-5 scale with typical s-curve value function for all characteristics 
(except market size, which is in $Bn)


Market rifle given current data

Establish clear alternatives
• Which verticals (brokerage or credit cards?)
• Which accounts?


Establish targeting and prioritization framework
• 13 carefully selected criteria based on win-loss analysis, customer interviews
• Thoughtful weighting is as important as the criteria



Get buy-in on the framework
Know how it will be applied
• Get buy-in on the framework before doing the analysis
• Application: A strategy presentation or an ongoing process?


Execute the analysis…
And don’t screw it up!
• Incorrect or misleading information is worse than nothing
• Getting good data requires creativity

Incorrect or misleading information is worse than nothing
Get meaningful data
• Don’t trade precision for correctness
• Analyst numbers can be useful but often are wildly off
• Consider weighting data by confidence in source
• Don’t be seduced by large sample sizes: 20 random and representative inputs beat 2,000 biased ones


Getting good data requires creativity and persistence
Get meaningful data
• Extrapolate from high confidence, easy to find data
• Example: Revenue opportunity by company
• Be creative on where to get data
• Customers, potential customers, employees, former employees, advisors, network (remember, sometimes just 20 high quality responses are meaningful)
• Make it as easy as possible to gather clean data
• Beware of leading questions, decouple weighting from data gathering
