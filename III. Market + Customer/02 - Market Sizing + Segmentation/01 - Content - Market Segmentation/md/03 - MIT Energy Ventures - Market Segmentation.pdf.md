 The Journey for the Holy Grail of Specificity
 Brainstorm for Potential Markets
 Analysis on Potential, Technical, Business and Personal Fit
 1. Deeper analysis of finite number of most promising market segments. Choose one of the market segments as First Order Beachhead
 2. Beachhead Market is chosen. First Order Beachhead Market is further segmented upon closer analysis
 3. A Target Customer Profile is developed further, sharpening the Focus, likely to be a further subsegment of market
 4. With clear definition of refined beachhead market and target customer, now do a Total Addressable Market (TAM) calculation
 5. Now we get very specific by finding and deeply understanding one real representative customer in our Target Market. This specificity will be our reference point for product development & marketing going forward

Core challenges of market entry
1. Electricity market is highly regulated (State and Federal) and extremely risk averse.
2. No clear acquisition mechanisms for primary customers (Utilities).
3. Entrepreneur’s paradox: Investors want to hear about large untapped markets, but as an entrepreneur you want to get product to market, likely in a niche, high-margin application.

Case Study: Ambri
Early Markets
– High electricity prices, mostly from diesel generation (remote/island grids), but also from significant congestion.
– Significant renewable generation
– Single end user: Vertically integrated utilities, large C&I/DOD

Target Customer Profile
I can generally see them and describe them to you but they are not in completely clear focus yet


Build a Persona
 It must be a real person
 Be visual
 Understand All Dimensions: Rational, Emotional and Social
 Priorities
 What do they fear most in the world?
 What motivates them more than anything else?
 What “water holes” do they go to?
 i.e., where do they congregate with others like them?
 Do this as a team – it will help unify your team and will get everyone
on the same (and proper) wavelength

• Medford High to Middlesex Community College
• Moved to Winchester
• Family with 2 kids (12, 15)

Fundamentals

• Know the basics of the overall energy space

vs. heavy, sour vs. sweet, Henry Hub…
• Know the terms in your part of the space: do people talk in metric tonnes, barrels, or gallons…or all three
• Know enough about your customers other options
– Direct and indirect competitors

Tradeshows + Conferences
