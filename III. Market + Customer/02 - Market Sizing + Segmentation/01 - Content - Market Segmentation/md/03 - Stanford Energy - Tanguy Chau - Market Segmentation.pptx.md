Agenda
* Why is market segmentation important
* How this applies to your startup
* Targeting the right market
* Appendix


What constitutes a market segment?
Collection of buyers and sellers that through their actual or potential interactions determine the price of a product or a set of product?

Examples
Industry
Real Estate
Your product
SFH in SF
Same market segment?
- SFH in San Carlos?
* Condo near Stanford?
* Commercial RE in SF?


Why is this important?
1. Know who your actual & potential customers and competitors are
* Misconception of the market versus reality

2. Impact public policy decisions
* Allow / challenge M&A

3. Prioritize your efforts & own a segment
* Find product market fit

Steps to market segment analysis
1. Establish clear alternatives
2. Establish targeting & prioritization framework 
3. Get buy-in on the framework; know how it will be applied
4. Obtain reliable data


Example: Your company sells voice response software for the Financial Services industry
0%
100%
Market Share
Total Market Potential ~$525M/yr
Industry Share


1. Establish clear alternatives
Which verticals ...which accounts?
Retail Banking
~$180M / yr
34%
Credit and Charge Cards
~$215M / yr
41%
Mortgage Credit   ~$25M / yrs
5%
Retail Brokerage   ~$40M / yr
7%
Investment Services   ~$35M / yr
7%
Life Insurance / Diversified Financial Services   ~$30M / yr
6%


2. Establish targeting and prioritization framework
* 13 carefully selected criteria based on win-loss analysis, customer interviews
* Thoughtful weighting is as important as the criteria

Criteria: (1) not captive to other telcom (2) did not buy IVR recently (3) big enough (4) other criteria

Example in practice
Approach taken to isolate application areas for growth
1. 
Standard taxonomy of markets and applications based on [Company1] capabilities
Number of applications ~1,500
Decision factors
2. Prioritize markets
Priority markets and their applications
75
* Market size, growhth, and profitability
* Industrial nature of application
3. Prioritize technical fit
Technically similar applications
30 - [Company1] only
15 - [Company1] + [Company2]
* Best technical fit
4. Prioritize for attractiveness
Most attractive applications
5
* Application market size and growth
* Product profitability
5. Deep five


Result: market for a next gen. power converter
Multiple Billion $ End Markets

Higher Power Consumer
Portable Electronics
$3.8 Billion Notebook Adapters (45-75W)
$4.0 B Mobile Devices (10-20W,, increasing w/ fast charge)
$2.0 B Gaming Laptops & Desktops (~150W power)
$0.6B Gaming Consoles (~200W power)
$2.0 B LED lighting
$6.2 B TVs (250W+ power)
$10.0 B Servers, E-bikes, EVs (500W+ power)
* Compelling/visible product
* Funds FINsix ASIC
* Volumes drive supply chain

Capturing value
Target a market segment where you CREATE and CAPTURE a lot of value

Perfect competition vs. monopoly
Small perceived difference because companies are incentivized to lie about their position
Perfect competition
“we are in a narrow market of our own … at the intersection of different markets”
“we are in a huge market defined by the union of many separate markets”
Monopoly
 Shrink their market to make it appear differentiated
Examples:
LED companies
Solar  technologies
Biofuels
 Expand their market to make it appear more competitive
Tesla
Google
Antitrust cases


Narrative of competitive companies
Xicato
* Remote phosphor LED module
* Higher “Quality of light”
  * Is the “Quality of light” a real market?
  * How big is it beyond possibly hospitality, museum and retail?
  * Is quality of light THE key attribute that consumer want and care about, or is it cost reduction?


Narrative of differentiated companies 
Tesla
* Small exclusive high-end electric car market
* High price point with profits made (>$100k)
* Attractiveness created brand ambassadors
vs.
Coda Automotive
* Large highly competitive economy car market
* Low price point far from profitable (~$30k)
* Looked terrible, drove even worse


Start slow: Focus and dominate a niche market first
Size of market segment
Find product market fit: win in a small segment where you can own the customer and make outsized profits before tackling the large competitive markets


Recognizing a competitive market
MiaSole

The trap of thinking


Takeaway for Cleantech 2.0
* The macro needs for energy solutions are real
* Lingering aversion to invest in capital intensive and long timeline projects
* Don’t be merely a market participant, be the dominant player
* Vision might be big but focus and dominate a niche market first
