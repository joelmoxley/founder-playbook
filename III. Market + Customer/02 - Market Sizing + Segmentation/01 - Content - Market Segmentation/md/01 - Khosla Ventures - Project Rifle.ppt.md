What is Rifle?
Quantified decision making framework
Provides a rigorous means of prioritizing among similar options
Done well, leads to improved decisions that are broadly supported
Appropriate for major decisions
In general involves 100+ hours of work & expensive resources per use



Rifle Improves Do-Or-Die Market Decisions 
“Market Rifle” – what market segments should we be in?
Intuition: focus on top 2,000 accounts; expand to complementary markets
Rifle analysis: narrow focus to 30 of top 200; stay in core market for 2+ years 
“Account Rifle” – which accounts should we target?
Intuition: great financial services targets: [Company 1], [Company 2]
Rifle analysis: none of the above are appropriate: better are [Com. 3], [Com. 4]
“Channel Rifle” – what channel strategy, what partners?
Intuition: leverage large existing sales forces of channel partners to expand sales
Rifle analysis: direct sales assisted by partners much more likely to succeed

Rifle In Practice: Get Meaningful Data
Incorrect or misleading information is worse than nothing
Don’t trade precision for correctness
Analyst numbers can be useful, but often are wildly off
Consider weighting data by confidence in source
Don’t be seduced by large sample sizes 
20 random & representative inputs beats 2,000 biased ones
Getting good data requires creativity & persistence
Extrapolate from high confidence, easy to find data
Example: revenue opportunity by company
Be creative in where to get the data
Customers, potential customers, employees, former employees, advisors – network, network (remember, sometimes just 20 high quality responses are meaningful)
Make it as easy as possible to gather clean data
Beware leading questions, decouple weightings from data gathering
