This presentation from the Energy Ventures course at MIT helps entrepreneurs assess the effectiveness of their economic operation by looking at COCA (cost of customer acquisition), LTV (life time value of a customer), IRR (Internal Rate of Return), and WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital).

Calculate the COCA

More Precisely…
* Example: Our new venture will sell a widget, and to successfully acquire a new customer it takes one of our sales people 1/20 of their time for 6 months.
* Let’s assume we pay the sales person $150K per year if they make 100% of their assigned quota. We will assume they make their quota.
* Then the sales person’s expense to close this deal might be seen as:
$150K* (6 months/12 months)*(1/20) = $3,750
* But there is more …

Additional Sales Costs…
* The sales rep has to be assigned their full costs beyond salary
* This could include: auto, real estate, administration, benefits, administration allocation, phone, internet, computer, etc.
* After we do a lot of digging and calculating, we estimate this to be $1,000.
* Then incidental costs associated with this account of travel, lodging, entertainment, demo units, tech support, etc. need to be included.
* After doing a lot of receipt checking and the like we estimate this to be $1,500
* Then the COCA = $3,500 + $1,000 + $1,500 = $6,250, right?

WRONG!
$6,250
~20X

How is that?
* Initial calculation did not include the conversion rate of 5% for the sales rep
* So the rep has to track 20 prospects for every sale and incurs the costs of these non-performers as well
* The sales cycle of 6 months is probably well below average
* There were many other resources that went into making the sales rep successful – e.g., website, sales support, advertising, tradeshows, help of executives, etc.
* Logically the bottoms up methodology should work if you took a long time and got to understand all of the costs but that is very difficult and costs are generally missed or even double counted
* The good news is that there is a much easier way that is more accurate …

Calculating the COCA Correctly
* Determine all your marketing and sales cost for your company for a set time period.
* That time period is related to the length of your sales cycle.
* It should be at least 2 times your sales cycle.
* Include not just the expenses for your marketing and sales group but also, if it is significant, an allocation of the executives and/or any other resources involved in sales & marketing.
* We will call this number TMSE(t) for Total Marketing and Sales Expense for a time period t.


Calculating COCA Correctly (cont.)
* Next, you determine if there is a substantial amount of the TMSE(t) that is dedicated for customer retention, e.g., customer support on going customers and we will call this IBSE(t) for Install Base Support Expense for time period t.
* We will then determine the number of new customers we close in the same time period and we will call this NC(t) for New Customer in the time period t.

Calculating COCA Correctly (cont.)
* Then the equation to calculate the COCA for any given period is:

COCA(t) = TMSE(t) - IBSE(t) NC(t)


It is Very Important to View COCA Over Time
* It will start out very high and then it should go down over time

COCA Key Factors
* Direct Sales vs. Telemarketers
* High Touch vs. Automated
* Conversion Rate
* Cost of Leads
* Quality of Leads
* Moving them Down through the Sales Funnel
* Design of Your Business Model
* WOM
* Focus => Decrease Sales Cycle

Direct Sales COCA Example

Calculate the LTV

Conceptually
* How much a new customer is worth to your venture over the life time with you
LTV = ∑ NPV (Profits for 5 years)
* Key considerations
  * Gross Margins (Pricing & Costs)
  * Cost of Capital
  * Retention Rate
  * Ability to Upsell or Capture Value in other Dimensions
  * Note that Profit is what matters and not Revenue
  * Skok’s Law: LTV must be at least 3X COCA
  
 LTV Example: Helios
 Life Time Value of Acquired Customer
 
 Example: Helios LTV
 Revenue Per Year (Assumes 5% Yearly Price Increase) =
 Gross Margin Profits from Revenues =
 Net Present Value at Above Cost of Capital =
 NPV of Profit Stream or LTV per Fleet =
 Pricing (Unit Price)
 Average Yearly Revenue per Fleet in Yr 1
 Gross Margin
 Price Increase Per Year
 Life of Product
 Retention Rate
 Cost of Capital for Company (est)
 
 
 Another Example
* Discount factor is a larger issue, as gross margin is further out
* Account changes in product price over time (in this case down)
* Also changes in margin (in this case up)

Adding the Energy Perspective

IRR > WACC
IRR: Internal Rate of Return
• “Unlevered”
• Impacted by lots of variables
• Variables that can change significantly over time
WACC: Weighted Average Cost of Capital
• For the project/product
• Include debt and equity costs
• Can be highly impacted by tax policy

You make $ of the spread
So ideally
IRR >> WACC

Focus on IRR
• But that’s hard (lots of variables)…
Easy to track
– Efficiency
– Cost per kW of panels
Site specific Harder to predict and track
– Cost per kW of balance of plant and installation
– Cost of operation
– Resource quality
– Longevity of project
– Tax incentives
– Energy sales
– REC sales
– Cost of sales (now higher than cost of panels for residential market!)
– Others…
– …and they change over time
