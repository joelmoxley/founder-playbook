This presentation provides a framework to identify and draw down risk associate with a technology over the course of future milestones. It involves assigning a scaled risk measure to each identified risk and aiming for a targeted lower risk value at each future milestone.

Risk Matrix

Purpose
* quantify the level of risk existing in a technology
* ensure that all milestones are focused on reducing risk
* identify those milestones most important to reducing risk
* communicate the reduction in risk versus time and cost


General Approach
1. identify major technical risk areas and failure modes by technology component
2. assign an initial absolute level to each risk
3. lay out a milestone schedule
4. assign a level of risk reduction associated with successful completion of milestone
5. track risk reduction versus time and expenditures


Risk Matrix
Identify Major Technical Risk Areas

First, the critical technical risks or failure modes are identified and categorized by product component. Groups of components can also have additional risks or failure modes.
Each risk is assigned a weighting factor (0 to 10) based on its criticality and relative importance to component performance.

several alternative designs or workarounds exist
an alternative design is likely, failure is not catastrophic
single-string component, product fails if this mode occurs, no known workarounds
Each component or component group can also weighted by its relative importance to product success.


Risk Matrix
Assign Initial Risk Levels
An initial, absolute level (0 to 100) is assigned to each risk based on level of confidence in preventing the failure mode at a manufacturing level.
demonstrated in-house; manufacturing steps known
key employee has demonstrated elsewhere
demonstrated by others elsewhere
not demonstrated by anyone, anywhere

The total initial level of risk of a component is the weighted average of the risk levels of the failure modes.



Risk Matrix
Milestone Schedule
Major project milestones (from Gantt chart) are listed.
Each milestone is expected to reduce risk in one or more categories.



Risk Matrix
Risks and Milestones
Risks and milestones are laid out in a matrix. Each milestone reduces the risk of a particular failure mode by some percentage.
When a milestone is achieved, the absolute risk associated with a component falls.
This translates into a reduction in the overall product risk (average of all component risks)


Risk Matrix
Charts
For any component (and for Product Risk), Risk Reduction can be plotted vs time and milestones.
Expenditures might also be plotted versus time on the same charts.
