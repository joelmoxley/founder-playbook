First, A Quick Survey…

Mission: Finding The Big Idea

It’s Simple, Right?
1.  Come Up With  A Killer Idea….
2.  Recruit (Zealotous) Team to Build “It”…
3.  Take “It” to the bank!

A Few Questions About “It”
* What problem will “It” solve?
* What kind of people will buy “It”?  
* How many people will buy “It”?
* Who will sell “It”?
* How much will people pay for “It”?
* How much will “It” cost to make?
* Who else makes something like “It”?
* Where will you get the money to make “It”?

v1.0:  KISS
An Automatic Back Scratcher
Flame from lamp (A) catches on curtain (B) and fire department sends stream of water (C) through window. Dwarf (D) thinks it is raining and reaches for umbrella (E), pulling string (F) and lifting end of platform (G). Iron ball (H) falls and pulls string (I), causing hammer (J) to hit plate of glass (K). Crashof glass wakes up pup (L) and mother dog (M) rocks him to sleep in cradle (N), causing attached wooden hand (O) to move up and down along your back.

Oasys
Energy and Resource Recovery


Engineered Osmosis (EOTM)
How it works
* Water is separated from the feed stream by a natural osmotic pressure – EO™ is an unpressurized desalination process
* The “draw” solution is designed to have a high osmotic pressure, but be easily removed through simple heating, producing potable water of high quality (same quality as RO)
* The membrane is nearly identical to that used in RO today and does not require specialized manufacturing
* EOTM can be integrated into power generation facilities without any reduction in performance or modifications to existing infrastructure, such as cooling towers and condensers

Energy and Resource Recovery


Oasys
Osmotic Application Systems
Engineered OsmosisTM (EOTM) is a new platform for recovering low quality heat to produce valuable energy resources; potable water, process water, electric power and energy storage
* Overview
  * EOTM utilizes low grade heat to generate high hydraulic pressures – “osmotic pressure”
  * Eliminates the need for large amounts of electricity for treating and desalinating water
  * Recovery of wasted energy / immediate increase in energy utilization and efficiency 
  * Lowest cost structure available for producing potable water from a variety of non-potable sources
* Oasys products
  * Reuse – single stage wastewater reuse to process water and indirect potable reuse
  * Desalination – Ultra low cost seawater desalination
  * Energy – power generation and utility-scale osmotic hydro-electric storage
* Commercialization
  * Pilot plant nearing completion - now being scaled to commercial demonstration product
  * 100-500 m3/day integrated skids for customer testing ready Q3 ’10
  * Company is seeking industrial and strategic partners for commercialization and scale-up



Water Markets
- Oasys is targeting three core markets
  * Desalination - $10B
  * Wastewater - $100B
  * Power Generation and Grid Storage - $1T
- Initial market entry points
  * Desalination – concentrating brine to existing increase plant capacity
  * Wastewater – Recovering industrial wastewater for reuse
  * Power/Storage – heat recovery osmotic storage device (DOE funded)
- Company is focused on markets with low barriers to entry
  * High demand for better water utilization
  * High demand for a disruptive approach, risk tolerance
  * Industrial customers, not municipalities
  * Small scale, “bolt-on” products, with reduced scope and ease of integration
  * Limited competition exploiting unique capabilities of EOTM

Cost Advantage
Technology
Total Water Cost ($/m3) 10c/kWh)
EOTM represents the lowest possible water treatment cost structure in the industry
This number will be significantly higher in markets where electricity is expensive
MED is energy inefficient, requires parasitic steam
Most energy efficient process available
* Recently completed detailed side by side cost estimate by TetraTech1
  * Cost differential:
    * 1/10 the electrical energy of RO separation
    * Capital savings of 20-30% over RO
    * >60% reduction in operating costs over RO
    * Significantly more thermally efficient than MED, at much lower temperature
* EOTM cost advantage grows with increase in cost of electricity prices


Oasys Market Entry Point
Evaluation indicates that seawater brine recovery is best product entry point
* RO bolt-on for brine recovery is an ideal entry point:
  * Company remains focused on core capability and largest market opp
  * Seawater desal is the best application of the technology
  * Gen I membrane is capable of treating brine at a 50% cost advantage
  * Bolt-on model limits risk to the customer – easy adoption
  * Market can be addressed at small scale initially
  * Company can use a “service” model to maximize profits / reduce customer impact / accelerate adoption
  * Value proposition is very clear – lowest cost expansion of existing facilities
  * Oasys plant can fall “within the fence” – no new permits required
  * Lux has validated the availability of waste heat within existing RO plants
* Product can be introduced early to drive revenues prior to greenfield execution
* Profitable small installations can be leveraged to move to larger scale
* Drives home the company’s mission of “Energy and Resource Recovery”



A Few Take Aways…
* You are not the target demographic
  * Know your target audience, ask them, then listen
* Don’t over-engineer, better to over market
  * What is your engineering to market research spend ratio?
* Fail early, fail often, fail cheaply – then succeed!
  * Get into the market as soon as possible
* Version thoughtfully, and regularly
  * Share product roadmaps with your customers (carefully)
* It’s not (only) about product features…
  * Don’t forget the “other” 3Ps 
* Know the competition as well as yourself
  * Sun Szu rocks
