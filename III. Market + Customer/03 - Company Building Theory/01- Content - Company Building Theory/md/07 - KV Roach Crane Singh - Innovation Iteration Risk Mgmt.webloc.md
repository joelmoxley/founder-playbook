ring I think it's what certainly the first time I've been here so I'm not quite sure why they asked an awning gasps old oil and gas go to talk to an audience like this on innovation but hopefully you'll see some of the reason why first day I work at calera and a huge vision and a great opportunity huge opportunity taking co2 and making cement out of it so we actually can do this and the issues for us are can we do it at scale and can we do it economically and reproducibly so those are some of those challenges so the whole idea is to have a huge solution for co2 so we have a pretty successful platform we can make cement and we can do it reliably and we've got a very clever way of making using electrochemistry in a novel fashion to create base to be able to assist the absorption it's a curious absorption system we're trying to move that platform out to grow that technology to make it more applicable to more space but there's a there's a belief within the company there's a whole bunch of different things we can do which are entirely different than the staff currently hired with the expertise we've got so we're trying to look outside the existing expertise using an expertise base that is comfortable in their own in their own space that presents quite a challenge so moving on to the process the this I don't want to take too long anyone is add anything to do with GE or major companies will recognize this process putting ideas in a hopper going through internal systems to check them out the last bits a little a little different we're going to talk to you a little bit about what we're doing internally and yesterday one of the presenters Scott said from into it they're doing exactly the same thing but then the next bit we're looking outside the company in a fairly clever way via the internet which is presenting us a much much larger set of people to look at the problem so so then you have this large machine that large companies like but with very really quite a small company so what we're trying to do is leave our the internal expertise in a pretty clever way to look at the problem in a completely different way and also use external innovation techniques to do that so the internal we've got some really talented people they've been picked because they're really talented but they're really talented in specific areas we're trying to ask them to look outside those areas so how do you best do that and in addition to that we're putting alongside that some external techniques to be able to widen that that opportunity set out to look at those solutions so firstly this is exactly what Scott was talking about what they did it into it built a web-based system ourselves called it blue planet lounge everybody has access everybody has an ability to look at everybody else's problems and see everything that's put on there that's working we've got a company out of around 80 or 90 people there's 70 people who've used it but really there's around 30 people who regularly use it so we're quite happy with it we've got some pretty good ideas and and of course the beauty of this is one person who have an idea on let's say I'll clearly the other one on a product and someone else looks at it and says no no the real value of that is putting it together and we've got a couple of examples of that going forward now and that's really working pretty well we would like to get more engagement for all of the company but getting 35 out of 80 people really isn't too bad to start with we by the way I've been in the company about six months this initiative is probably around four months old in addition to that we're looking at using the internet based search mechanisms with two companies Gentry is the company that are all about problem formulation they come and spend a long time defining what your challenges up they do it with your staff and then they have a network that they then put that problem out to this companies based in Boston and they have a huge linkage to Russia and around two and a half thousand registered solvers looking at problems we're just starting that process there we've met with them once and they're in for two days starting tomorrow and and thursday in the company the other one we're a little further down the track on is innocentive and I'm a few people this morning and they've looked at using this whereby you define the problem with them and they they put it up on their internet they have a link to nature as well and that process is ongoing so gen 3 I've really already told you this slide so I've got a bit ahead of myself this one is a little more expensive than the other route and there's enough up front expenditure whereas InnoCentive is really all a based about success you define with the incentive group what sort of prizes you'll give if you end up with success as defined by the criteria you start with and that's the incentive approach that we've been running this now in a sense of around 12 weeks and we've got the first set of challenges back and we have I believe 250 solvers registered who have given over the any IP to us for anything they find if we end up giving them the price so so that's a that's a pretty a pretty interesting way of levering a very small company with a limited scientific staff now the issue will be what the quality of those results are and also how quickly we can get through evaluating them and here are the three challenges they're pretty big challenges for the company you know novel novel ways to to make bicarb novel ways of converting the the carbonic acid from an aqueous process into carbonate and then one of our big challenges is the process we knew we use to make base makes an acid so it's how do you use that acid which is unfortunately in a dilute and dirty state and that one is receiving the most attention and we are pretty optimistic about some of the work that's going on in that space from these searches so really it's all about a very small company leaving the expertise internally to look at the problem in a different way both internally and externally and that summarizes what we're doing and I'm very happy to say I'm one and a half minutes under type thank you very much nope sorry it is still yours oh yeah I just rushed through that some backup in case we got some questions I'm not quite sure how that's working and I think somebody is so much I get this figured out I could just start talking open to suggestions here so I'm Steve Kramer um lightsail energy and we're developing grid-scale energy storage systems there we go that used compressed air as the storage medium and effectively what we make is a very large very efficient air compressor that sort of jewels varnish looking machine up there is kind of a first product and although the looks kind of Victorian the technology really requires a lot of innovation and as I'm sure everybody in this audience doesn't doesn't need to hear from me that the more innovative your technology is the more iterations it's going to take to get it right and we recognize that right from the beginning and the node recognized it as well and I remember about a year or so ago we were in a status meeting with him and he said almost casually what you guys should do is figure out how to iterate ten times faster and we you know we nodded politely and wrote that down but it did start working on me and I started thinking about you know well so what is the problem why is iterative development normally slow and I think the big answer is is that you know you design something you build it you test it you look at the results you think about the results you use you know your conclusions from that process to inform the next design and so forth and so it's an extremely serial process that's rational it's fairly efficient but it's very slow so we asked ourselves what can we do to really speed it up and so two ideas the first one is exactly what Tim Brown said yesterday which is you want to actually engineer the development process itself so you want to think about how you actually do this development and what he didn't say at least not explicitly is that you're not going to get the process right the first time that there's sort of a meta meta iteration required where you really need to look at how it worked and you know where your pipeline stalled and you know where you where you went off into the weeds and then refine the process until you can basically build a pipeline that's that runs really smoothly and the pipeline is the second idea that you want to develop in parallel you want to paralyze as much as possible which is not always that logical because if you think about it so for example for our valve designs we are currently testing our first generation our second generation is being assembled in going through unit tests the third generation now is being said is going through simulation CFD simulation and the first generator the fourth generation just came off the you know came off the design table which means we actually haven't even gotten the results from testing our first one before we've designed our fourth generation is that going to be wasteful maybe but the point is if it isn't and usually it isn't usually you get you know you have a pretty good idea of what you need to do next the next and next those things are coming out of the pipeline every couple of weeks instead of every few months so we stole a lot of ideas as you probably guess from the people who you know that saw the classic CPU cache theory that first off you know analogously with having the the memory right next to the processor so that it's accessible very quickly you want to be able to do as much as possible of your iteration process in house and not contracted out you want to look ahead you want to guess what subsequent iterations are going to need and get stuff ready for those alright so that's fairly abstract let me give you take you quickly through a case study here so one thing we need to do is the design water spray system so we spray water into our compression chamber it absorbs a lot of the heat makes the process much more efficient we're a bunch of physicists we've never designed spray nozzles or anything remotely like it in our lives so we asked one of our advisors and he sent us off to a very highly regarded consulting firm that shall remain nameless and they they spent about six weeks came back with a design for a spray system I'll talk about in just a moment and it just it just didn't make any sense what their design was was could not be built and we said oh no you have to wait another six weeks to get you know to get to get a new version so we decided we just we needed it right in days instead of weeks and so we decided to bring it all in house we looked at what's involved in each step so design simulation fabrication unit tests in other words test just the nozzles without the whole system and then ultimately if that works and they match up with the simulation then you put it in the full in the full system first thing we did is we look at each of those steps found out where the bottlenecks were some of the steps are a lot longer than others we try to make every step the same length of time no more than two days and that way the pipeline could run very smoothly so starting with the design we made a lot of different spray nozzles that's our rogues gallery of early designs on the upper upper picture one thing we realized pretty quickly is you had to engineer the you know the thing that holds those things they're all different sizes and shapes and and that was very inefficient so we started making a consistent size a standardized package that they that they go into and then I mentioned about refining the iterative process the final thing here you see on the you're right I guess is a carrier that the nozzle screw into so it's extremely fast to try new ones rather than having to pull the whole thing in and out simulation actually ended up being the bottleneck it actually took longer to simulate the behavior of a nozzle than to build another one and test it out but we really needed there was a lot of value in the simulation too so we bought a lot of high-end computing resources are able to do ten simulation simultaneously and that then sort of brought everything in line with everything else the real key though being able to fabricate these things in-house really no substitute for a computer our control mill if you're making stuff like this this way you can we can make fifty variants that very methodically went through you know a large parameter space we can make multiples we can have extras ready to go in later we also built the lab just to test nozzles it was very expensive but it was designed specifically for very high throughput operation and could not possibly have gotten as far as he did without it and then finally in system testing mostly involved coming up with clever ways of cycling everything through that you're looking right down into our compression cylinder there that all the nozzles finally installed in operating so in terms of the results we did create a pipeline that was that was that could operate very smoothly when it needed to it can produce a new design every two days instead of every six weeks and the consultant mentioned earlier their original design had 720 novels with the pressure behind them of a thousand psi and what we're running now and by the way we're not done yet is 32 now is a 200 psi so that's a 100x improvement to the design which we did in under four months so I think that that that shows you the value of you know really thinking about how you go about doing this and yeah and suddenly threw out a lot of nozzles and so forth but ultimately you know it we saved the organization's time we saved a lapse time overall by quite a bit and that's really our highest value resource great let's play the presentation is up here there we go ok so I'm jagdeep singh I'm honor and CEO of a very early stage science project that's in the energy storage space and the risk is extremely high in fact we had a board meeting last week one of our investors besides the note is KP and they told us that we are the highest risk project in their portfolio hopefully the highest return as well but highest risk and so risk is something we've been thinking a lot about and this is my fourth start up now with vinod and you know it encourages us to think a lot about risk so I think a lot of this is techniques that I've used in the past to manage risk that have actually worked out really well in terms of outcome so it's fun to share with you kind of the way that that we've dealt with risk in the past so the basic goal of course is is the idea is to try and build an entire execution plan around managing risk and the reason is essentially value creation at a startup level is really synonymous with systemic risk reduction and in the end job of the CEO can be thought of as the chief risk manager your your job really is to think about everything that can go wrong and make sure that that you've adequately addressed all those possibilities and and are knocking them off one by one so the basic process pretty straightforward obviously you want to have you obviously have a business goal you're trying to accomplish and based on that goal you want to first start by identifying all the key risks and prioritizing all the key risks and this involves sitting on with your core management team the core technical team taking through every single thing go wrong and and basically listing all those risks out step two is identify what it takes to to eliminate those risks so for every single risk other some experiments are there some models you know what do you need to know or do in order to take that risk off the off the list step three then once you have that list is literally to build your execution plan by literally taking that list of risk mitigation steps and putting it on a schedule with deliverables and timelines and so on and step four is obviously use that plan as your execution sort of you know blueprint and execute to what you've what you've laid out there so just a little more detail on each of these steps in terms of defying the risks the key questions of courses are related to one of the key unknowns that could result in failure failure being defined as not meeting your goal and the goal could be in the near term a technical result longer term you know business goal margin goal revenue goal and so on but in the end risk obviously comes in all flavors technical marketing financing and so on you want to prioritize and rank order these risks so you don't want to randomly attack the risk but you totally want to you want to focus on the biggest things that can go wrong up front and I think when I mentioned this yesterday as well but if you fail you want to fail early there's a lot less damage done by failing early and by failing you know in two or three or four years after you've spent tens of millions of dollars and wasted a lot of your time and your people's time and so on and then you want to try and put some some level of quantification of each risk this is obviously the subjective but you want your team to brainstorm and say which of the if we accomplished you know elimination of risk number two for example how much would we reduce the overall risk ahead of us where to go from one hundred percent to eighty percent when they go down to fifty percent and so on and just think it through this it's always going to be subjective but thinking through it helps you as a team agree on what you think the most important risks are and of course is dimensionally focus on the biggest risk first because that's that's really a way to minimize a waste of time so this is just one example of how you would put all these all these lists together are the different categories of risk for example in our case this conceptual risk what if the whole concept is flawed there's fabrication risks what if you can't make a sufficient level of uniformity or control and so on order to hit the the numbers that you have this market risks there's a competitive risk customer risk and so on and you want to literally go through all the risks identify what the category is the issue is and then and then try and get some sense of the level how important is this risk ie how serious are the consequences of this risk materializing and what's the probability of that risk materializing and use that to kind of we use a simple red yellow green kind of methodology but in the end it combines the the magnitude the risk with the probability of the rest basically step 2 then is identifying the steps to mitigate these risks do you need to know to take that risk off the chart what do you some experiments you can do there's some models are there some deals do you need some IP from some supplier there's some customer validation that you need in order there is a lot of other things you could do to eliminate the risks identify each of those steps these steps then are going to become the basis for your plan so you learn LG step you define what the mitigation levels are and do that for all the myths on the chart and then you basically build your plan around that bliss once you have that list of risk mitigation steps that effectively is the input to your schedule you literally go out and you say you know what what when can we accomplish this the step who do we need to accomplish this step what do we need with a capital how can minimize the burn rate you know one and then you put all together into a chart this is an actual chart that we use and I don't want to go into more detail later but but suffice to say that you got all the all the risks basically line up to specific decision points and and risk reductions and then you can literally plot risk reduction against cash burn and you obviously want to make sure that that risk reduction the reduction chart curve and the cash burn curve are sort of inverses so in our case risk reduction drops along a certain access based on certain results and the cash burn goes up and to some extent you want to make those things inverse proportional you can't all this control though my last company for example use a chart like like this so you put a fast forward here seems to be stuck on this chart the folks the control room can can forward one slide that would be episode ago yeah so this is a chart that we actually use in my last company in panera and what you can see here is that and this burn rate here is in is in millions so what you can see is the risk isn't coming down very much for the first several months it's still very close to a hundred percent over eighty percent certainty but the burn rate is you know to you know two and a half million dollars a month so you know you there's some cases in which basically you you in our case we couldn't do a lot of this production until we built the fab produce real parts though there was a certain burn associate so you have but you know at least those are the few months in which you kind of in the white knuckle period if you will unfortunately we were able to pull this off and the company went public and so on but but you ideally want to keep your cash burn you know push the cash burn out relative risk reduction curve and then step 4 of course is you you want to execute execution involves you know delivering on the on the milestones that you have on that chart and then updating the risk matrix this will clearly change as you knock off those risks you're going to basically change the miss matrix in the schedule you want to keep that up to date and as risk is reduced value is going to be created and when you go to your next round of financing for example you're going to be able to say you know we have the following risks that we were worried about when we did the first round on the second round and these books are out of the way so you know we believe the company's worth more and that makes sense people I think generally understand that and apparently that's just a very useful way to keep the team focused on what really matters and not stuff that's sort of um you know peripheral there's a lot of things you can do before you ship product at the end the day but some of them are mission critical and it can kill you now and some of them are sort of would be nice this way you can kind of keep the team will you focus on what really matters and with that i think i'm also on schedule and turn back to smear
