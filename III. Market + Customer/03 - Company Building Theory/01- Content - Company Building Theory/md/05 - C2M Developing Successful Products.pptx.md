Risks & priorities 


Innovation Through Partnership
Often innovation is inspired by a perceived market application opportunity*
An existing unfulfilled need or an emerging customer creation opportunity  
Innovation Partnership
* Lead User Innovation is an exception


Commercialization Strategy
Exploration of market and business model opportunities
Characteristics of markets, users and stakeholders
Market asset structure
The requirements for application of technology to market context
Commercialization Strategy


Market opportunities are realized through a product



Successful Products 
Match technology to the needs and wants of product stakeholders in the market-space and in the application (use) environment
Create compelling & differentiated value experience
Attributes of successful products:
Serve an attractive market
Profitable
Competitive advantage
Accessible (channels)
Manufacturable
Serviceable
Concurrent with complementary products
Sustainable



Who are the stakeholders?
The firm (its strategic objectives & constraints)
Shareholders  
Customers (end users) 
Channel players

Product Realization Path-finding
Pathfinding hones the direction of research, product concept, and product platform
* Deep dive iterative process of matching technology to market context: 
  * Understand customers/users, use environment and validate the product concepts 
  * Bi-directional evolution in emerging markets and applications where user needs are not established
  * Product Path Finding

CleanTech-to-Market Path
Identify the critical factors that drive the technical and commercial feasibility of C2M
Product Realization Path-finding
Exploration & Feasibility 
Technical and commercial feasibility of alternate application scenarios and design concepts is essential before investment in product development.
Multitude of market opportunities and applications, and technological & market uncertainties require risk assessment and priority setting.


Complementary Technologies & Products
Technologies and products that users must have to make your product fulfill their needs and meet the intended functions
Concurrent development of complementary products
