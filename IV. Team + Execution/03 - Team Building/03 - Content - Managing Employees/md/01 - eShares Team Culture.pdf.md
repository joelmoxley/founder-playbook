The eShares 50-year vision.



Our Organization



eShares is managed like a professional sports team, not a startup or a company.



Show up on time. Every day. We start at 8:30am.



Practice get better
* Individual skill is the only thing that matters.
* Practice. Get better at what you do.



No titles just positions
* We are all defined as eShares employees.
* We play positions like “Sales”, “Product”, “Dev”.
* We are not defined with titles like “Vice President” or “Senior Analyst”.



“Org chart” is our current formation.
* The “org chart” changes depending on the goals of the organization.
* We change the org chart frequently (sometimes every month).
* People move groups and change managers frequently.
* People are tied to positions, not titles.



Teams are limited to 8
* Amazon calls it the “two-pizza rule.”
* Nobody is allowed to have more than 8 direct reports.
* If a team has to grow past 8, then it splits.
* It is impossible to “empire-build.”



We operate in public for everyone to see



Success isa grind
* 90% of success is a grind.
* Practice, training, and conditioning is repetitive and hard.
* Doing the hard work is what makes you (and the company) more valuable.



How we work (as individuals)



We are software people (even if you are not an engineer)
* Watch Jeff Lawson

Discussion


Do things that don’t scale
* Read “Do things that don’t scale: http://paulgraham.com/ds.html
* Learn by doing. There are no shortcuts.
* Intuition matters. Develop it quickly and early.

Create Leverage
* Efficiency is not the same thing
* Efficiency is minimizing effort for a given impact.
* Leverage is maximizing impact for a given effort.
* CREATE LEVERAGE in everything you do


Learn or Leverage
Do you know what to do?
No Yes
Do things that don’t scale
Create leverage
“Learn” vs “execute”



Iterate Quickly
* Meerkat’s frantically dig, but every 20 minutes they stop to look around.
* Stop and ask “am I heading in the right direction?”
* Get feedback early and often
* Everyone waits too long to get feedback. DON’T WAIT.


Timebox
* Commit to spend X minutes to accomplish something. You are finished after X time.
* Timebox everything.
* Timebox things you love so you don’t spend too much time on them. Leverage is maximizing impact for a given effort.
* Timebox things you hate so you spend enough time on them.


Timebox Scheduling
* Your calendar is a timeboxing scheduler. Timebox everything.
* What do you do? = Where do you spend your time?
* e.g. 2 hrs/week-> Marketing, 4 hrs/week-> Sales, 8 hrs/week-> Training, etc…
* Schedule time to work on important problems


Ask for help
* Help is, by definition, asymmetrical.
* Most people are afraid to ask for help. Don’t be afraid.
* Demand that your colleagues “Always be helpful.”



Always be helpful
* We are helpful. To each other, to customers, to partners, to everyone we interact with.
* Remember ABH - Always Be Helpful
* NEVER be annoyed when somebody asks you for help (no matter how small)
* Helpfulness is core to who we are.
* Those who are not helpful will be fired. This is not a joke.


Breadth vs.Depth
* Start new projects breadth-first.
* Solve the broad easy problems first. Then dive into the details. Helpfulness is core to who we are.
* The 80%-20% rule is almost universal.
Breadth-first
Depth-first


Managing Up
* He who does the work has the leverage.
* Credibility (i.e. being right) matters.
* Win arguments with data, not opinions.


Nurture Ideas
1. The immediate reaction is to kill a new idea. Instead, nurture it.
2. Evaluate ideas with rigorous debate.
3. Do not evaluate ideas on who had the idea.


Do or Kill
1. We work in 1-week sprints. Do a task this week, next week, or kill it.
2. Don’t be afraid to kill tasks. If they’re worth doing they will resurface.
3. When you can, do things now.


The Shower Principle
* Read the Top Idea in Your Mind: http://paulgraham.com/top.html
* “It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.”
* What are you thinking about in the shower?



Business Principles


Inside Out vs. Outside In
1. The Artist’s Dilemma.
2. Customers don’t tell us what to build.
3. The role of product is to build a solution. The role of business to teach the world how to use that solution.



Craftsman vs. Factory Workers

Competition is for losers
* Peter Thiel - Competition is for losers
* http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec05/



Innovators Dilemma
* “An innovation that is disruptive allows a whole new population of consumers access to a product or service that was historically only accessible to consumers with a lot of money or a lot of skill.”
* http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/11/04/understanding-how-theinnovators-dilemma-affects-you/



“What will change in the next 10 years?”
“That’s a good question. But a better question is: What’s not going to change in the next 10 years?” -
Jeff Bezos



Network Effects
* Networks grow exponentially
* They are defensible
* USV investment thesis - https://www.usv.com/post/investment-thesis-usv
* The dentist story - http://avc.com/2014/07/thedentist-office-software-story/



How we work Part 2 (as a team)



Is your business in shape to compete?
>Read more

Loosely coupled. Highly aligned.


Team Morning Meetings
* Meet with your team at 8:30am every M, W, F
* Use this time to solve problems and brainstorm ideas
* Raise issues, debate ideas, uncover problems, find solutions
* Don’t be shy
* Pay attention - this is where we learn



Company Show & Tell
* Company Show & Tell is T and Th at 8:30am
* Show work-in-progress, let people know what you are working on Raise issues, debate ideas, uncover problems, find solutions
* Do not wait until it is “finished” to share
* Learn from others
* Pay attention - this is where we learn

American Idol
* Happens twice every day for an hour.
* By the time a feature gets to American Idol, it should be ready to ship.
* The most effective teams are the teams in American Idol every day.
* Ship lots of small features, not a few big features.


Team Offsites
* Step back from what we do, and think about how we do it.
* Everyone comes away with something they’ve finished, or something they plan to finish in the next week.
* Show and tell the offsite the next week.


Cagematches
* Not a meeting. Goal is to solve a problem or tackle a big project.
* Can be an hour. Can be a week.
* Most companies have cubicles because “working” is something you do alone. At eShares we work together.



Why so many meetings?
* We move extremely fast on product and business
* Our biggest challenge is quickly disseminating information to everyone
* Our biggest risk is people working on the wrong things
* The antidote is TimeBoxing spending time together
* Individual success is proportional to ability to learn from others
* We give you opportunities everyday to do so


1-on-1s
* Every 2-3 weeks with your direct manager
* Go for a walk. 30-40 minutes.
* Have fun. This is your time.
* Talk about what’s on your mind. Doesn’t have to be work related.


Why 1-on-1s?
* TimeBox building relationships
* An organization is a network
* Network strength is proportional to # of connections and quality of those connections
* Strong relationships is our competitive advantage


What do I talk about during 1-on-1s?
* Complaints. Get it off your chest.
* Successes. Brag about yourself.
* The weekend. What are you doing?
* Questions. What random question have you wanted to ask?
* Anything that is on your mind. It is all fair game.


What does the manager do in 1-on-1s?
* The manager’s rules for 1-on-1s are:
* Shut-up and listen
* Seriously. Shut-up. Even if it is awkwardly silent.
* Do not offer advice, feedback, or lessons. Do not ask for it either.
* Just get to know the person you are talking to

Compensation


Discussion: How should a company set compensation?


Market basedcompensation
Market Value is determined by:
1. What could person get elsewhere?
2. What would we pay for replacement?
3. What would we pay to keep person?
This is conditional within our corporate peer group and the role.

Example: A Big Law Attorney can make $X at a law firm but wants to do Business Development at a startup. We would not use $X as market value for that attorney but instead what he or she would make doing business development at a startup.



Mark employees to market
1. Most companies assess market value at hiring time.
2. We use regularly scheduled review periods as opportunity to “mark-to-market” every employee.
3. Goal is to keep each employee at 75th percentile of market for that person
4. That means 1 out of 4 companies would pay them more than we would: So why don’t people leave for a 100th percentile company?


Non financial compensation
1. Great leadership: helpful, mission-driven, transparent, collaborative
2. People love coming to work: autonomous, fun, team-focused
3. Everyone feels heard: daily meetings, town halls, open office
4. Most importantly, increase our employee’s market value: 1-1s, training, mentorship, challenging work

Reason eShares Employees Stay
Financial Compensation
Non-Financial Compensation



Why not pay top of market
1. We must earn our talent (we can’t “buy” it)
2. The best people deeply value non-financial compensation (often more than financial)
3. Employees that optimize for top-of-market pay are often mercenaries and difficult to align

The first review is 9 months after start date
Then every 12 months after that
Start Date 
9 months 
21 months 
33 months
Why 9 months for the first review?
We can address a change from the starting salary of the candidate more quickly if need be.



When do we review compensation?


Our benefits philosophy
* Offer benefits to encourage behavior we feel is important
* Avoid making everything free as it encourages waste (i.e. there should be some cost to the decision maker)
* Most benefits are a percentage contribution of your cost by the company (often 50%/50% but sometimes different.


Benefit List
* 80% Employer Contribution for Healthcare
* 401K Matching 2:1 (i.e. eShares contributes $1 for every $2 you put in your 401K) up to $2K
* 50% reimbursement of gym membership
* $50 flat-fee for cell phone reimbursement
* Free catered lunch
* Team building events
* Onsite Haircuts


Career Tips


Three Stories
• https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc


Wax on wax off
1. Do the hard work
2. Develop your skill set
3. One day you will wonder “how did I just do that?”


Expected career path


Actual career path #1


Actual career path #2



Key Concepts
* Change in responsibility happens before change in compensation (leading indicator)
* However, responsibility and compensation are much more loosely correlated than you would think
* In general, companies are very bad at determining the immediate value of a person at a point in time
* But the market is good at determining the value of a person’s career
* Usually Responsibility ≠ Compensation at a point in time but…
* The Total Responsibility converges to The Total Compensation over a career (The area under the respective curves)
* To increase compensation, increase responsibility


Discussion: How do you measure a CEO?


How do you measure a CEO
1. Does the CEO know what to do?
2. Can the CEO get the organization do what s/he wants?
This is a good measure for everyone.
The organization could be just YOU.
The organization could be the department you manage.
This is how trust is earned and responsibility is given.


Three rules for work
1. Enjoy it
2. Get better at it
3. Learn from it
If these are not true, tell your manager.
If the two of you can’t make these true, then quit
