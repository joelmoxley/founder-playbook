Hiring
* At early stage, team is everything.  Once you have the resources, hiring is one of the biggest, hardest, and most important parts of your job as founder/executive
* Building a top team is your responsibility – not just your direct reports but across the org chart
* Easy to underestimate amount of effort required
* If hiring lifts a bottleneck, prioritize over all else


Sourcing Talent
* Vast majority of your hires at early stage will and should come from internal network
* Create, compile, and cultivate your shared network – keep adding as you meet people you respect/like/trust
* Identify, track, and constantly contact the top nodes (academic groups, industry experts, etc.)


Reaching Out to Your Network
* Keep it short/clean  move details to link or attachment
* Highlight info that will entice the people you are targeting
* Ask for redistribution
* Referral bonuses are cheap and can increase good will among your network


Facilitating/Tracking the Process
* Each lead represents an enormous amount of time and energy
* When possible, create communication templates & have someone else be you for initial interactions 
* Develop a process or use an app to facilitate, track, and stay focused
* Make process as streamlined as possible
* Various apps out there to manage process
* Communications / recruitment hit list will be different for different positions
* Your board will appreciate stats on efforts


Staying on Point
Visa Issues Recruiter hired


Staying on Point
* Put your resources where your risks are!
* Match hiring needs to major risk areas, not arbitrary roles
* Review and adjust you hiring needs/goals on a regular basis


The Courting Ritual
* Attract first, decide later.  Evaluate the candidate, but always sell the company (both implicitly and explicitly).
* You want everyone who walks through the door to want more than anything to work with you.
* Communicate with the candidate – don’t assume you know what they are thinking or doing


Evaluating the Candidate
* Never hire for experience over intrinsic ability, unless making that compromise is the only way to retire a key risk.
* Know whether you are hiring for an independent brain or dependent hands – generally a binary choice.
* Interview is like a first date – limited insight into long-term fit. Trusted network referrals are best indicator.
* Trust your gut and keep your standards high – a team with a vacancy is better than same team with B player – hard to keep standards under pressure to hire.


Typical Process
Review application materials
1. Were they referred/recommended by trusted source
2. Do they have experience we said we needed
3. Worth a phone screen?
4. If yes, send template email to auto schedule 30 min phone screen

Phone screen
1. (8 mins) your pitch: background on company/opportunity and answer their key questions 
2. (8 mins) their story: background, trajectory, and why they think this would be a fit
3. (8 mins) your critical questions: on their background, motivations, experience, expertise, etc.
4. (3 mins) discuss any key constraints: e.g. geography, visa, compensation.
5. (3 mins) wrap up: when possible, make real-time call on (A) not good fit, (B) invite for interview, (C) phone call w/ cofounder
6. Take notes, especially on pros/cons & anything you might want to probe further in future interactions

Interview
1. Schedule interview, arrange travel for them, send agenda in advance 
2. 1:1 meetings with all founders & key team members + some less formal interactions over lunch or dinner
3. Presentation by candidate when appropriate as an opportunity to test experience, thought process, etc.
4. Always be selling, try to portray natural culture/mode, ask for some work product if appropriate, tee up your team members in advance or in real time to probe specific characteristics of candidate, whenever possible make call in real time on (A) we’ll get back to you or (B), we think you’d be a great fit and would like to do some final diligence with your references and/or have you talk to our bad ass board member/advisor.

Reference checks (ideally 360º)
1. If they came through a trusted, experienced referral and all other aspects were positive, then reference checks are primarily to gain additional knowledge on strengths/weaknesses before you hire them.
2. If they did not come through a trusted referral, be sure to do both formal and backdoor checks.


Closing the Deal
* Ideally you have a compensation range already pre-approved by board of directors (if needed) 
* As with anything, you want to get to a win-win.
* Remember that value is set by the market and next-best alternative. That said, compensation is not necessarily the biggest driver for your candidate’s choice. That’s why you need to always be selling.
* Psychology and expectation-setting are key to making sure your candidate feels as good as possible about the offer
* Recruitment doesn’t stop at the offer: make sure they are excited on day one and beyond – small efforts make huge impact


Not done yet…
* Recognize mistakes quickly, and immediately prepare to fix them…but give folks a chance.  
* Listen to your gut.  If it feels wrong, it probably is.
* Celebrate the team internally and externally – leverage it as an asset to your brand.
