Typical Patterns of Team “Issues” and What to Do
Pattern
Prevention/Solution
Don’t meet enough 
Set regular meeting schedule (time/date/location) early on. If people avoid meetings because they are a waste of time, improve meetings vs. not having them..
Procrastinators 
Self-identify early if you are a procrastinator and give permission for teammates to call you on it early. Plan ahead on deliverables so you do have time to do the team work portions of the assignment.
Dueling dictators 
If this occurs, other team members call it out early and constructively. Lead with curiosity vs. judgement/shaming to find the causes and the solutions. Sort out style from substance issues.
Divide and blunder 
When delegating work, ensure planning includes both process and time for integration of work products. Talk through hand-offs fully so all those involved know timing, content and quality requirements.
Delegators dilemma 
Ensure team roles include balanced amounts of leading and doing of the work. Rotation of roles helps avoid people getting “stuck” in a specific role for longer than they might like.
Idea-of-the-week 
Create good decision criteria in advance of having to make difficult decision with imperfect information. Talk to your GSIs about their experience re: making tough choices.
Socialitis 
Being successful is the best kind of fun to have. Figure out how to be both supportive and respectful AND have highstandards, be disciplined and rigorous. They don’t have to be mutually exclusive.
Social loafers 
Differentiate between chronic social loafing and someone needing a break . Talk early and often about availability. Agree at the beginning on how to handle people not meeting commitments.
Team Darwin 
Every once in a while you find yourself on a team that seems hell bent on self-destruction. Do two things. Don’t panic. Don’t just hang in there - instead get help early. The program needs you.
Don’t know each other well enough 
Spend the time to get to know each other socially early on. Teams that are all work and no play are brittle - they can break under stress. Socialize a few times during the semester. You’ll be glad you did.
Lack of clear SHARED goals 
Ensure you know each other’s individual goals for the class, that you have a common set of goals for the objectives of the class, and that you are aligned with your client’s goals and the program’s goals.
Un-addressed style clashes 
Style clashes are normal. And, they also need to be addressed. Be curious about the needs driving the style choices being made. Usually there is a good instinct that can be honored in some other way.
Teams doing the wrong work 
Teams are not good at doing everything - choose carefully what is work done best by team, by sub-group or by individuals. E.g. - writing and editing are NOT team sports.
Meetings that waste team members’ time 
Have an agenda. Circulate it in advance. Have clear tasks, assignments and accountabilities. Have a time keeper, a note taker and a facilitator role for each meeting and rotate throughout the semester. Start on time. End on time. 
Avoiding feedback
Agree from the beginning that the part of the purpose of your team is to help every member become a greater expert on clean tech and a better leader and team player. Then agree on how to give each other feedback informally throughout the semester as an intentional contribution to each person’s development. Keep it light, but keep it real.


Mid-semester Feedback Process
* Survey gets distributed electronically
* Fill it out, print out your copy (2/28)
* Come to feedback session with your team (3/9, 11am to 1pm)


Team Contracting (aka goal setting)
* Complete the contracts outside of class
* Typically takes some individual think time + about 90 minutes of team discussion time. Its worth the time investment. Trust us.
* Create a format and modify content so that it works for your team.
* Turn them in when ready.
* For team fitness “exercise”, check in with each other periodically to see how tell you are sticking to your team contract and/or if some aspects of it need to be modified to match new circumstances.


What should I do if...?
...if something is happening that you would just like some expert advice on, or an issue crops up that seems too difficult to handle easily within the team, just ping Umanity, that is why we are here.
