WHEN DIVERSITY HELPS Start-ups
Multiple meta-analyses have now shown that the effects of team diversity are contextually driven
Diversity helps when:
* The differences are complementary and bring unique perspectives on the task
* There is an overarching common goal and identity and shared set of values
* The team is willing to believe in the value of diversity



WHEN DIVERSITY BACKFIRES in STARTUPS
Demographic Faultlines: 
Hypothetical dividing lines that may split a team into subgroups 

Bottom line: Faultlines hurt collaboration in teams!

Male, marketing

Take-aways: Who to hire for your start-up

Functional diversity is good for performance
Beckman, Burton, and O’Reilly (2007) found that functional diversity helped young high-tech firms (N=161) get funding and complete IPOs

But look beyond expertise fit; also consider personality and value  fit
Every team needs stars AND team players

Helpful individual traits in start-ups:
Experience
Flexibility and tolerance for ambiguity
Risk-tolerance 
Willingness to mentor and be a team player
Resilience
Commitment to hard work
Self-starting
Passion for your business

...and according to recent research, don’t shy away from pessimism! Start-ups are often over-confident!



Diversity: Describe Your Start-up
What are the most visible forms of diversity (or similarity) in the start-up?
Are there fault lines?
How is the team composition influencing interactions in the start-up?
What can the start-up do in order to improve its composition or the culture around it?



02 Hiring in Start-up Teams



Hiring the dream team
Thomas Goetz, CEO and Co-founder, Iodine
“Many entrepreneurs describe recruiting as the most difficult, most important thing they do. Their stories typically involve unicorn chases, the quest for candidates worthy of their company. 
But few admit to the other side of that equation: how hard it is to persuade the best prospects to stake their careers on your idea.
 In other words, it's one thing to find those unicorns. But it's quite another to talk them into following you into the thicket.”



Hiring the dream team for your start-up
Tips and Best Practices to Lure Unicorns:
Sell your mission (your passion!) and why it matters
Make the most of the start-up culture
Offer incentives – money, prestige, flex work, etc
Facilitate personal development 
Promote the ability to define and craft role and to grow with the company
