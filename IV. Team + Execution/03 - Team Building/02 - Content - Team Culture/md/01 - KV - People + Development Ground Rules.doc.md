People and Development Ground Rules 
[Authored in 1999 by David Weiden; “divlet” refers to small AOL division]

1.  Personal goals and relationships are more important than work 
*	There's time for personal issues.  If you need to miss work on occasion for personal reasons you should do so and not fear that your work evaluation will suffer.  Note however that you've chosen a demanding profession so you'll need manage your personal life so that you are able to achieve excellent results at work. 
*	Don't take work too seriously and have respect for people.  It is mandatory to treat everyone with dignity and respect.  While it is perfectly acceptable to have healthy and even passionate debate and disagreement about ideas, nothing at work is worth yelling or personally attacking other people. 
2.  Everyone agrees to enjoy the job and maintain sustainable workload 
*	Fun makes sense.  You spend a lot of your life working, so work should be fun.  Fun is good thing in itself and ultimately this will make you more productive at work anyway, so why not? 
*	Maintain sustainable workload.  You will be happier and ultimately more productively if you pace yourself and don't burn yourself out.  Also, there are no requirements in terms of minimum hours.  That being said, there are high expectations in terms of output, and for everyone so far this requires hard work in terms of intensity and time. 
*	It's up to your manager AND YOU.  Enjoying work and maintaining an acceptable workload is primarily up to you -- if you're not having fun or are working too much, say something, decide to change what's bothering you, ask for cooler assignments, etc. 
*	Vacations.  Vacations are aggressively supported in this group.  Others in your group will chip in and help you get out of town or hang out at home or whatever. 
3.  Personal development is a top priority 
*	This divlet strives to provide outstanding career opportunities and personal development.  Some of the ways to accomplish this include: 
   
  *	Partner with your manager.  Being proactive and honest with your manager about what you want to work on, what your aspirations are, other opportunities that interest you, etc. will allow them to best help you.  Also, you should feel free to have these discussions with other mentors or managers. 
  *	Ultimately, your own career success is up to you.  Good managers and peers will help you succeed, but you're in charge.  It's up to you to work with your manager and peers and peers to make sure you understand your options and opportunities, development areas, etc.  In the words of Jim Barksdale, "your career is not a team sport." 
  *	Clear objectives and feedback.  Generally the most successful employees want clear objectives and lots of feedback because it is easiest to succeed under these conditions.  You and your manager may use some combination of written objectives, self-assessments, and career plans. 
  *	Focus on development and promotions will follow.  A mistake some people is to focus on titles and promotions rather than on underlying development.  Focus on improving your skills and track record and promotions will follow. 
4.  Communicate proactively and honestly 
*	Be honest and direct.  Let's not beat around the bush.  It's much better to hear bad news than not hear it, get straight answers to questions, know exactly where you stand, etc.  Consequently, be prepared to give and receive blunt communication.  For example, if there's a problem with your project, don't say it's going fine.  If your manager annoyed you yesterday when they cut you off at a meeting, tell them.  If you're left off a project you want to be on, say so. 
*	Be proactive.  If you have an idea / comment / suggestion, please make it, don't assume others are clairvoyant.  Also, it's up to you to involve others as appropriate in decisions before they're made, update them on potential problems, etc.  Also, proactively raise problems and potential problems.  It's never bad to raise a potential issue.  It's completely unacceptable to know something could turn into a disaster for weeks but not say anything and then blindside your manager after it's already a crisis. 
*	Ask for help.  It regularly makes sense to ask others for help.  In this group, asking for help is cool and a sign of strength, not weakness.  Don't spin your wheels – ask for help! 
*	Be clear when you want information to stay private.  In general everything you say or write is public, forward-able material unless you specifically say otherwise.  Be sure to be clear about this. 
5.  Play to win 
*	Set big goals and go after them aggressively.  If you want to come to work, punch the clock, go through the motions without passionate concern for your impact on the company, you're at the wrong place.  Here we set huge, exciting goals that will delight customers and shatter the competition and we are determined to accomplish them.  Everyone can have a significant impact on these goals in many different ways ranging from identifying and fixing a broken process to pitching in on a customer request. 
*	Take risks and accept some mistakes.  Given how aggressive our business goals are, you should expect to stretch and take some risks to hit them.  Part of taking risks is making mistakes.  Making mistakes is ok, it is part of the learning process, just make sure that you learn from your mistakes and don't make the same mistake twice.  This doesn't mean that we should be reckless, we should take calculated risks. 
6.  Be disciplined 
*	We try to keep administrative overhead to a minimum.  If you think the requirements are dumb that's fine, and it's ok to discuss not doing them or doing them in some alternative way with your manager.  Ignoring them is not acceptable. 
*	Specific expectations are determined by individual groups, but probably include the following: 
 *o	Give advance notice for vacations or absences.  In general you are expected to be at work during roughly normal working hours -- however, it's 100% fine for you to either take vacations or work at home. 
 *o	Give special attention to email marked IMPORTANT or URGENT.  If you need to be sure someone in the group reads or responds to you quickly, mark you email accordingly. 
 *o	Check voicemail, email and Calendar daily.  You are expected to check your email and voicemail daily and respond to urgent messages.
