PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project consists of the construction of a building to accommodate a repeater station, with cable head-end, on the current [SPECIFY] system of [COMPANY NAME]
The building, having an approximate gross area of [NUMBER] square feet, will be constructed on a property of approximately [NUMBER] sq. ft., at the intersection of [FULL ADDRESS] [STATE/PROVINCE]. 
The characteristics of the basic building are as described in the documents remitted by [COMPANY NAME] on [DATE] a copy of which is found in the schedule hereto; such document has been annotated in accordance with the instructions received on [DATE].

The construction cost of such building is evaluated at approximately [AMOUNT], all taxes included.
The preparation of plans and specifications is expected to begin as soon as possible in order to proceed with tender calls and contract awards during the winter of [NUMBER] in order that the site work may be performed from [DATE] to [DATE]
 
SCOPE OF SERVICES AND METHODOLOGY

Manager proposes to Owner to perform the planning and design of its repeater-station construction project in accordance with the project-management method and to perform the construction work in accordance with the construction-management method.
Project management integrates under the same entity all specialists who will be participating in the project execution, from the preliminary planning to project commissioning. This group directs the instructions and requirements of Owner toward a single spokesperson, thereby improving the quality of the coordination and the rapidity of execution.

Construction management enables the work to be performed more economically and feasibly, Owner acting as Contracting Authority through Manager, its representative, and each specialized contractor performing its work directly for Owner, without the intermediary of a general contractor.

In addition, overall management (project and construction) enables the planning, design, tender call and execution stages to be carried out by overlapping of activities, contrary to the classic method of project execution whereby the activities are performed in succession, one stage to be terminated before another begins. This deliberate overlapping of activities enables the work to be undertaken within the shortest possible time.

Manager includes a multidisciplinary staff of professionals and technicians and can hence assume full responsibility for the mandate, from the planning stage to the completion of the work and commissioning.

Manager offers to perform the mandate comprehensively by providing to Owner the services of architects, engineers, technicians, designers, draftsmen and all other support staff in the area of project management, architecture, engineering and construction management.

"	Construction Management
"	Site organization
"	Selection and hiring of site personnel
"	Contract awards to contractors
"	Work management
"	Scheduling
