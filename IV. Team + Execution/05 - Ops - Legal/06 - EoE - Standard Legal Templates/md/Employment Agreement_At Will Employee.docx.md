21.	COVENANTS INDEPENDENT

Each restrictive covenant on the part of the Employee set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as a covenant independent of any other covenant or provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement which the Corporation and the Employee may have, fully performed and not executory, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by the Employee against the Corporation whether predicated upon another covenant or provision of this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Corporation of any other covenant.


22.	PROPRIETARY CREATIONS 

All processes, inventions, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other intangible rights (collectively the "Inventions") that may be conceived or developed by Employee, either alone or with others, during the term of Employee's employment, whether or not conceived or developed during Employee's working hours, and with respect to which the equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of Company was used, or that relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the Invention to the business of the Corporation or to Corporation's actual or demonstrably anticipated research and development, or that result from any work performed by Employee for Corporation, will be the sole property of Corporation, and shall be considered “works for hire”, and Employee hereby assigns to the Corporation all of Employee's right, title and interest in and to such Inventions. Employee must disclose to Corporation all inventions conceived during the term of employment, whether or not the invention constitutes property of Corporation under the terms of the preceding sentence, but such disclosure will be received by Corporation in confidence. Employee must execute all documents, including patent applications and assignments, required by Corporation to establish Corporation's rights under this Section.


23.	DIVISIBILITY OF COVENANT AREAS AND PERIODS

If any portion of the restrictive covenants contained herein is held to be unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, each covenant shall be considered divisible both as to time and geographical area; and each [NUMBER] month of the specified period shall be deemed to be a separate period of time and each [NUMBER] mile radius segment of the geographical area shall be deemed to be a separate geographical area, so that the maximum lesser time and geographical area shall remain effective so long as the same is not unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy.


24.	INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE RELIEF 

Employee and Corporation recognize and expressly agree that the extent of damages to Corporation in the event of a breach by Employee of any restrictive covenant set forth herein would be impossible to ascertain, that the irreparable harm arising out of any breach shall be irrefutably presumed, and that the remedy at law for any breach will be inadequate to compensate the Corporation. Consequently, the Employee agrees that in the event of a breach of any such covenant, in addition to any other relief to which Corporation may be entitled, Corporation shall be entitled to enforce the covenant by injunctive or other equitable relief ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.


25.	VENUE; COURT PROCEEDINGS 

The Employee and the Corporation hereby agree that the venue of any action, proceeding, counterclaim, cross claim, or other litigation relating to, involving, or resulting from the enforcement of this covenant shall be in [STATE/PROVINCE]. In any action or proceeding by Employee relating to or involving the enforcement of the covenant, and any counterclaim, cross claim or other litigation which may be asserted or brought against Corporation, the Employee hereby expressly waives any and all right to a trial by jury with respect to the action, proceeding or other litigation resulting from or involving the enforcement of this covenant. Further, in any action or proceeding by Corporation to obtain a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction, Employee hereby agrees that the Corporation shall not be required to post an injunction bond in excess of the principal sum of [AMOUNT] in order to obtain a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction. Should the Corporation's action for a temporary restraining order and/or motion for preliminary injunction be granted in whole or in part and should Corporation be ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining a permanent injunction to enforce the covenant, Employee hereby waives any and all rights Employee may have against Corporation for any injuries or damages, including consequential damages, sustained by the Employee and arising directly or indirectly from the issuance of the temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction.
26.	INDEMNIFICATION 

The Employee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Corporation and its officers, directors, shareholders and employees harmless from and against any loss, claim, damage or expense, and/or all costs of prosecution or defense of their rights hereunder, whether in judicial proceedings, including appellate proceedings, or whether out of court, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, attorneys' fees, and all costs and expenses of litigation, arising from or growing out of the Employee's breach or threatened breach of any covenant contained herein.


27.	ACKNOWLEDGMENT 

The Employee acknowledges that when this Agreement is concluded, the Employee will be able to earn a living without violating the foregoing restrictions and that the Employee's recognition and representation of this fact is a material inducement to the execution of this Agreement and to Employee's continued relationship with the Corporation.


28.	SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS 

All restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.


29.	LIMITATIONS ON AUTHORITY

32.	INVALID PROVISION; SEVERABILITY

The invalidity or unenforceability of a particular provision of this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions hereof, and the Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provisions were omitted.



33.	MODIFICATION

34.	APPLICABLE LAW AND BINDING EFFECT; NO WAIVER

35.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT 

This Agreement contains the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, amendment, modification, or discharge is sought.
