RECIPIENT can disclose the INFORMATION to its directors, officers, employees and to its subsidiaries or its affiliates directly concerned with the evaluation of the INFORMATION only after such directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates have undertaken, in writing, to comply with the obligations undertaken by RECIPIENT under this Agreement. Unless it receives written permission from INFORMANT to disclose, in whole or in part, any Confidential Information to a third party, RECIPIENT shall maintain in confidence, not disclose and not authorize anyone to disclose such Confidential Information. RECIPIENT agrees not to use nor authorize anyone to use any Confidential Information for any purpose not authorized in writing by INFORMANT.

8.	Upon receipt of a written request from INFORMANT, RECIPIENT shall promptly return to INFORMANT all Confidential Information disclosed by the INFORMANT, including all reproductions and copies thereof together with all material and documents generated by RECIPIENT containing such Confidential Information or references thereto from which references to the substance of such Confidential Information can be implied or understood.
