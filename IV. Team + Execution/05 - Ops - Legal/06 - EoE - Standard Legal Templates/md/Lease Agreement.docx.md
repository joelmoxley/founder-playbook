21.	LANDLORD’S REMEDIES

In the event that: 

a.	Tenant shall on three or more occasions be in default in the payment of rent or other charges herein required to be paid by Tenant (default herein being defined as payment received by Landlord ten or more days subsequent to the due date), regardless of whether or not such default has occurred on consecutive or non-consecutive months; or 

b.	Tenant has caused a lien to be filed against the Landlord's property and said lien is not removed within [NUMBER] days of recordation thereof; or 

c.	Tenant shall default in the observance or performance of any of the covenants and agreements required to be performed and observed by Tenant hereunder for a period of [NUMBER] days after notice to Tenant in writing of such default (or if such default shall reasonably take more than [NUMBER] days to cure, Tenant shall not have commenced the same within the [NUMBER] days and diligently prosecuted the same to completion); or 

d.	[NUMBER] days have elapsed after the commencement of any proceeding by or against Tenant, whether by the filing of a petition or otherwise, seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under the present or future Federal Bankruptcy Act or any other present or future applicable federal, state or other statute or law, whereby such proceeding shall not have been dismissed (provided, however, that the non-dismissal of any such proceeding shall not be a default hereunder so long as all of Tenant's covenants and obligations hereunder are being performed by or on behalf of Tenant); then Landlord shall be entitled to its election (unless Tenant shall cure such default prior to such election), to exercise concurrently or successively, any one or more of the following rights: 

i.	Terminate this Lease by giving Tenant notice of termination, in which event this Lease shall expire and terminate on the date specified in such notice of termination, with the same force and effect as though the date so specified were the date herein originally fixed as the termination date of the term of this Lease, and all rights of Tenant under this Lease and in and to the Premises shall expire and terminate, and Tenant shall remain liable for all obligations under this Lease arising up to the date of such termination, and Tenant shall surrender the Premises to Landlord on the date specified in such notice; or 

ii.	Terminate this Lease as provided herein and recover from Tenant all damages Landlord may incur by reason of Tenant's default, including, without limitation, a sum which, at the date of such termination, represents the then value of the excess, if any, of (a) the Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent, Taxes and all other sums which would have been payable hereunder by Tenant for the period commencing with the day following the date of such termination and ending with the date herein before set for the expiration of the full term hereby granted, over (b) the aggregate reasonable rental value of the Premises for the same period, all of which excess sum shall be deemed immediately due and payable; or 

iii.	Without terminating this Lease, declare immediately due and payable all Minimum Rent, Taxes, and other rents and amounts due and coming due under this Lease for the entire remaining term hereof, together with all other amounts previously due, at once; provided, however, that such payment shall not be deemed a penalty or liquidated damages but shall merely constitute payment in advance of rent for the remainder of said term. Upon making such payment, Tenant shall be entitled to receive from Landlord all rents received by Landlord from other assignees, tenants, and subtenants on account of said Premises during the term of this Lease, provided that the monies to which tenant shall so become entitled shall in no event exceed the entire amount actually paid by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to the preceding sentence less all costs, expenses and attorney's fees of Landlord incurred in connection with the reletting of the Premises; or

iv.	Without terminating this Lease, and with or without notice to Tenant, Landlord may in its own name but as agent for Tenant enter into and upon and take possession of the Premises or any part thereof, and, at landlord's option, remove persons and property there from, and such property, if any, may be removed and stored in a warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of, and for the account of Tenant, all without being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage which may be occasioned thereby, and Landlord may rent the Premises or any portion thereof as the agent of Tenant with or without advertisement, and by private negotiations and for any term upon such terms and conditions as Landlord may deem necessary or desirable in order to relet the Premises. Landlord shall in no way be responsible or liable for any rental concessions or any failure to rent the Premises or any part thereof, or for any failure to collect any rent due upon such reletting. Upon such reletting, all rentals received by Landlord from such reletting shall be applied: first, to the payment of any indebtedness (other than any rent due hereunder) from Tenant to Landlord; second, to the payment of any costs and expenses of such reletting, including, without limitation, brokerage fees and attorney's fees and costs of alterations and repairs; third, to the payment of rent and other charges then due and unpaid hereunder; and the residue, if any shall be held by Landlord to the extent of and for application in payment of future rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder. In reletting the Premises as aforesaid, Landlord may grant rent concessions and Tenant shall not be credited therefore. If such rentals received from such reletting shall at any time or from time to time be less than sufficient to pay to Landlord the entire sums then due from Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall pay any such deficiency to Landlord. Such deficiency shall, at Landlord's option, be calculated and paid monthly. No such reletting shall be construed as an election by Landlord to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such election has been given to Tenant by Landlord. Notwithstanding any such reletting without termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for any such previous default provided same has not been cured; or

v.	Without liability to Tenant or any other party and without constituting a constructive or actual eviction, suspend or discontinue furnishing or rendering to Tenant any property, material, labor, Utilities or other service, whether Landlord is obligated to furnish or render the same, so long as Tenant is in default under this Lease; or
vi.	Allow the Premises to remain unoccupied and collect rent from Tenant as it comes due; or 

vii.	Foreclose the security interest described herein, including the immediate taking of possession of all property on or in the Premises; or 

viii.	Pursue such other remedies as are available at law or equity. 

e.	Landlord's pursuit of any remedy of remedies, including without limitation, any one or more of the remedies stated herein shall not (1) constitute an election of remedies or preclude pursuit of any other remedy or remedies provided in this Lease or any other remedy or remedies provided by law or in equity, separately or concurrently or in any combination, or (2) sever as the basis for any claim of constructive eviction, or allow Tenant to withhold any payments under this Lease.


22.	LANDLORD'S SELF HELP

Provided, however, that Landlord may cure any such default as aforesaid prior to the expiration of said waiting period, without notice to Tenant if any emergency situation exists, or after notice to Tenant, if the curing of such default prior to the expiration of said waiting period is reasonably necessary to protect the Leased Premises or Landlord's interest therein, or to prevent injury or damage to persons or property.
