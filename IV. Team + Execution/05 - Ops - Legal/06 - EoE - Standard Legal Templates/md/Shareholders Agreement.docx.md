The Company shall notify each Shareholder within [NUMBER] days following the expiration of the [NUMBER]-day period described above of the amount of Offered Securities which each Shareholder may purchase pursuant to the foregoing sentence, and each Shareholder shall then have [NUMBER] days from the delivery of such notice to indicate such additional amount, if any, that such Shareholder wishes to purchase.

Upon the closing, which shall include full payment to the Company, of the sale to such other person or persons of all the Refused Securities, the Shareholders shall purchase from the Company, and the Company shall sell to the Shareholders the Offered Securities in respect of which Notices of Acceptance were delivered to the Company by the Shareholders, at the terms specified in the Stock Offer. 

d.	In each case, any Offered Securities not purchased by the Shareholders or other person or persons in accordance with Section 4(c) may not be sold or otherwise disposed of until they are again offered to the Shareholders under the procedures specified in Sections 4(a), (b) and (c).
