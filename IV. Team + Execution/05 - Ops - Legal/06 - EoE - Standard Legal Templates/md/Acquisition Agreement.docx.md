The Company understands that the Purchaser Preferred Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the [YOUR COUNTRY] [YEAR] Act and are being issued in accordance with a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the [YOUR COUNTRY] [YEAR] Act, which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of the Company’s representations as expressed herein.

c)	Rule [NUMBER]. The Company acknowledges that the Purchaser Preferred Shares must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the [YOUR COUNTRY] [YEAR] Act or an exemption from such registration requirement is available.

The Company is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of Purchaser or any of its agents and understands that the Company (and not Purchaser) shall be responsible for the Company's own tax liability (if any) that may arise as a result of the investment in the Purchaser Preferred Shares.

f)	Transferability. The Company agrees, acknowledges and understands that, without the consent of Purchaser, the Purchaser Preferred Shares may not be sold, pledged, transferred or otherwise disposed of, provided that such restrictions shall not prevent the Company from converting the Purchaser Preferred Shares to shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Determination whereupon such shares may be transferred subject to applicable securities law restrictions.

g)	Legends. The Company acknowledges and understands that the securities of Purchaser issued hereunder shall bear the following legends (and any other legends required under state securities laws in the opinion of legal counsel for Purchaser):

THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER TO THE EFFECT THAT ANY PROPOSED TRANSFER OR RESALE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE [YOUR COUNTRY] ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE [YOUR COUNTRY] STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

9..6	Procedures for indemnification

If any action, suit or proceeding shall be commenced against, or any claim or demand be asserted against, the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, in respect of which the Company or Purchaser is entitled to demand indemnification under Section 9 of this Agreement, then as a condition precedent thereto, the party seeking indemnification ("INDEMNITEE") shall promptly notify the other party ("INDEMNITOR") in writing to that effect, and with reasonable particularity and with reference to the applicable provision(s) of this Agreement. 

The Indemnitor shall have the right to assume the entire control of the defense, compromise or settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim and including the selection of counsel, subject to the right of the Indemnitee to participate (at its expense and with counsel of its choice) in the defense, compromise or settlement of such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand, and in connection therewith, the Indemnitee shall cooperate fully in all respects with the Indemnitor in any such defense, compromise or settlement. 

The Indemnitor will not compromise or settle any such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. So long as the Indemnitor is defending in good faith any such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall not settle or compromise such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnitor or its agents all records and other materials in the Indemnitee's possession reasonably required for contesting any third party claim or demand. 

If the Indemnitor shall fail to promptly and adequately defend any such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand, then the Indemnitee may defend, through counsel of its own choosing, such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand and (so long as Indemnitee gives the Indemnitor at least [NUMBER] days' notice of the terms of the proposed settlement thereof and permits the Indemnitor to then undertake the defense thereof if Indemnitor objects to the proposed settlement) to settle such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand and to recover from the Indemnitor the amount of such Losses.

A claim or claims for indemnification under this Section 9 must be brought, if at all, at any time within [NUMBER] year after [DATE], provided however, that any claim or claims for indemnification for breaches of the representations and warranties made by the Company in Sections 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9 may be brought at any time within [NUMBER] years after [DATE], and any claim or claims for indemnification resulting from breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants made herein involving intentional fraud or willful misconduct may be brought at any time until the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions) has expired.

9..8	Indemnification payments

a)	Payments made by the Company to Purchaser in satisfaction of its indemnification obligations under this Section 9 shall, at the option of the Company, be made either (a) in cash or (b) in shares of Purchaser Common Stock, with each share valued at the Purchaser Average Price.

b)	Payments made by Purchaser to the Company in satisfaction of its indemnification obligations under this Section 9 shall, at the option of Purchaser, be made either (a) in cash or (b) by adjusting the Conversion Price, as defined in the Certificate of Determination, so that upon conversion of the Purchaser Preferred Shares into shares of Purchaser Common Stock, The Company will receive an additional number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock, with each share valued at the Purchaser Average Price, that have a value equal to the amount of the indemnification payments due to the Company from Purchaser.

9..9	Sole remedy

Except with respect to the covenants contained in Sections 6.1, 7.3 and 7.5, for which injunctive relief shall be available, the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 shall be the sole remedy with respect to any claims arising under this Agreement.
