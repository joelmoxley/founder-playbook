3.5.	The Corporation shall immediately after the Conversion Date deliver to the debenture holder following the exercise of its conversion right a certificate for the Shares registered in the name of the debenture holder for the number of Shares to which the debenture holder is entitled.

3.6.	Should the debenture holder opt to convert the entire amount contemplated in Section 3.1, the delivery pursuant to subsection 3.4 of the certificate for the appropriate number of Shares registered in the debenture holder’s name shall constitute the performance of all the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Debenture, such that all amounts due and payable pursuant to this Debenture shall be deemed to have been paid.

3.7.	Should the debenture holder opt to convert less than the entire amount contemplated in Section 3.1, then upon the conversion of the present Debenture, the debenture holder shall be entitled to receive a new debenture upon the terms and conditions herein contained for the balance of the Principal not converted.
