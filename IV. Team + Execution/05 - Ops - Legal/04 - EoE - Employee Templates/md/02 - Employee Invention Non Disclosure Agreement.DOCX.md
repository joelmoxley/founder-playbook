[COMPANY NAME]
INVENTION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Invention and Non-Disclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”) made this [____] day of [_____________], 20[  ], is by and between [_____________], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and [____________] (the “Employee”).
In consideration of the employment or continued employment of the Employee by the Company, the Employee and the Company agree as follows:
1.	Condition of Employment.
		The Employee acknowledges that Employee’s employment and/or the continuance of that employment with the Company is contingent upon Employee’s agreement to sign and adhere to the provisions of this Agreement.  The Employee further acknowledges that the nature of the Company’s business is such that protection of its proprietary and confidential information is critical to the survival and success of the Company’s business.  
2.	Proprietary and Confidential Information.
(a)	The Employee agrees that all information and know-how, whether or not in writing, of a private, secret or confidential nature concerning the Company’s business or financial affairs (collectively, “Proprietary Information”) is and shall be the exclusive property of the Company.  By way of illustration, but not limitation, Proprietary Information may include discoveries, ideas, inventions, products, product improvements, product enhancements, processes, methods, techniques, formulas, compositions, compounds, negotiation strategies and positions, projects, developments, plans (including business and marketing plans), research data, clinical data, financial data (including sales costs, profits, pricing methods), personnel data, computer programs (including software used pursuant to a license agreement), customer, prospect and supplier lists, and contacts at or knowledge of customers or prospective customers of the Company.  The Employee will not disclose any Proprietary Information to any person or entity other than employees of the Company or use the same for any purposes (other than in the performance of Employee’s duties as an employee of the Company) without written approval by an officer of the Company, either during or after Employee’s employment with the Company, unless and until such Proprietary Information has become public knowledge without fault by the Employee.  While employed by the Company, the Employee will use the Employee's best efforts to prevent unauthorized publication or disclosure of any of the Company’s Proprietary Information.
(b)	The Employee agrees that all files, documents, letters, memoranda, reports, records, data, sketches, drawings, models, laboratory notebooks, program listings, computer equipment or devices, computer programs or other written, photographic, or other tangible or intangible material containing Proprietary Information, whether created by the Employee or others, which come into Employee’s custody or possession, shall be and are the exclusive property of the Company to be used by the Employee only in the performance of Employee’s duties for the Company and shall not be copied or removed from the Company premises except in the pursuit of the business of the Company.  All such materials or copies thereof and all tangible property of the Company in the custody or possession of the Employee shall be delivered to the Company, upon the earlier of (i) a request by the Company or (ii) termination of Employee’s employment for any reason.  After such delivery, the Employee shall not retain any such materials or copies thereof or any such tangible property.
(c)	The Employee agrees that Employee’s obligation not to disclose or to use information and materials of the types set forth in paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) above, and Employee’s obligation to return materials and tangible property, set forth in paragraph 2(b) above, also extends to such types of information, materials and tangible property of customers of the Company or suppliers to the Company or other third parties who may have disclosed or entrusted the same to the Company or to the Employee in the course of the Company’s business.
3.	Developments.
(a)	The Employee has attached hereto, as Exhibit A, a list describing all discoveries, ideas, inventions, improvements, enhancements, processes, methods, techniques, developments, software, and works of authorship, whether patentable or not, which were created, made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Employee prior to the Employee’s employment by the Company and which are owned by Employee, which relate directly or indirectly to the current or anticipated future business of the Company, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder (collectively, “Prior Developments”); or, if no such list is attached, Employee represents that there are no Prior Developments.  Employee agrees not to incorporate any Prior Developments into any Company product, material, process or service without prior written consent of an officer of the Company.  If Employee does incorporate any Prior Development into any Company product, material, process or service, Employee hereby grants to the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid right and license to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, import, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works, display, perform, transmit, distribute and otherwise exploit such Prior Development and to practice any method related thereto.
(b)	The Employee will make full and prompt disclosure to the Company of all discoveries, ideas, inventions, improvements, enhancements, processes, methods, techniques, developments, software, and works of authorship, whether patentable or not, which are created, made, conceived or reduced to practice by Employee or under Employee’s direction or jointly with others during Employee’s employment by the Company, whether or not during normal working hours or on the premises of the Company (all of which are collectively referred to in this Agreement as “Developments”).  The Employee acknowledges that each original work of authorship which is made by the Employee (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of Employee’s employment with the Company and which is protectable by copyright is a “work made for hire,” as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act. [The Employee agrees to assign and does hereby assign to the Company (or any person or entity designated by the Company) all Employee’s right, title and interest in and to all Developments (other than Prior Developments listed on Exhibit A, if any) and all related patents, patent applications, copyrights and copyright applications.  However, this paragraph 3(b) shall not apply to Developments which do not relate to the business or research and development conducted or planned to be conducted by the Company at the time such Development is created, made, conceived or reduced to practice and which are made and conceived by the Employee not during normal working hours, not on the Company’s premises and not using the Company’s tools, devices, equipment or Proprietary Information.  The Employee understands that, to the extent this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of any state which precludes a requirement in an employee agreement to assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this paragraph 3(b) shall be interpreted not to apply to any invention which a court rules and/or the Company agrees falls within such classes.  The Employee also hereby waives all claims to moral rights in any Developments.]   
(c)	The Employee agrees to cooperate fully with the Company, both during and after Employee’s employment with the Company, with respect to the procurement, maintenance and enforcement of copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights (both in the United States and foreign countries) relating to Developments.  The Employee shall sign all papers, including, without limitation, copyright applications, patent applications, declarations, oaths, formal assignments, assignments of priority rights, and powers of attorney, which the Company may deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in any Development.  The Employee further agrees that if the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure the signature of the Employee on any such papers, any executive officer of the Company shall be entitled to execute any such papers as the agent and the attorney-in-fact of the Employee, and the Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each executive officer of the Company as Employee’s agent and attorney-in-fact to execute any such papers on Employee’s behalf, and to take any and all actions as the Company may deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in any Development, under the conditions described in this sentence.
4.	Obligations to Third Parties.
The Employee represents that, except as the Employee has disclosed in writing to the Company on Exhibit A attached hereto, the Employee is not bound by the terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party to refrain from using or disclosing any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information in the course of Employee’s employment with the Company, to refrain from competing, directly or indirectly, with the business of such previous employer or any other party or to refrain from soliciting employees, customers or suppliers of such previous employer or other party.  The Employee further represents that Employee’s performance of all the terms of this Agreement and the performance of Employee’s duties as an employee of the Company do not and will not conflict with or breach any agreement with any prior employer or other party (including, without limitation, any nondisclosure or non-competition agreement), and that the Employee will not disclose to the Company or induce the Company to use any confidential or proprietary information or material belonging to any previous employer or others.
5.	United States Government Obligations.
The Employee acknowledges that the Company from time to time may have agreements with other persons or with the United States Government, or agencies thereof, which impose obligations or restrictions on the Company regarding inventions made during the course of work under such agreements or regarding the confidential nature of such work.  The Employee agrees to be bound by all such obligations and restrictions which are made known to the Employee and to take all action necessary to discharge the obligations of the Company under such agreements.
6.	Miscellaneous.
(a)	Equitable Remedies.  The Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of the Company and are considered by the Employee to be reasonable for such purpose.  The Employee agrees that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement is likely to cause the Company substantial and irrevocable damage which is difficult to measure.  Therefore, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to such other remedies which may be available, shall have the right to obtain an injunction from a court restraining such a breach or threatened breach without posting a bond and the right to specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement and the Employee hereby waives the adequacy of a remedy at law as a defense to such relief.
(b)	Disclosure of this Agreement.  The Employee hereby authorizes the Company to notify others, including but not limited to customers of the Company and any of the Employee’s future employers or prospective business associates, of the terms and existence of this Agreement and the Employee’s continuing obligations to the Company hereunder.
(c)	Not Employment Contract.  The Employee acknowledges that this Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment, does not imply that the Company will continue Employee’s employment for any period of time and does not change the at-will nature of Employee’s employment.
(d)	Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any corporation with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to the Company’s assets or business, provided, however, that the obligations of the Employee are personal and shall not be assigned by Employee.  The Employee expressly consents to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement for the benefit of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to whose employ the Employee may be transferred without the necessity that this Agreement be re-signed at the time of such transfer. 
(e)	Severability.  In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.
(f)	Waivers.  No delay or omission by the Company in exercising any right under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of that or any other right.  A waiver or consent given by the Company on any one occasion is effective only in that instance and will not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right on any other occasion.
(g)	Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the [State/Commonwealth of _________] (without reference to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof).  Any action, suit, or other legal proceeding which is commenced to resolve any matter arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement shall be commenced only in a court of the [State/Commonwealth of _________] (or, if appropriate, a federal court located within [___________]), and the Company and the Employee each consents to the jurisdiction of such a court.  [The Company and the Employee each hereby irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement.] 
(h)	Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the Employee and the Company relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.  This Agreement may not be modified, changed or discharged in whole or in part, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Employee and the Company.  The Employee agrees that any change or changes in Employee’s duties, salary or compensation after the signing of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.
(i)	Captions.  The captions of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, limit or affect the scope or substance of any section of this Agreement.

CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2870
INVENTION ON OWN TIME – EXEMPTION FROM AGREEMENT
THIS IS TO NOTIFY EMPLOYEE, in accordance with Section 2872 of the California Labor Code, that:
a)	Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:
(1)	Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer, or
(2)	Result from any work performed by the employee for his or her employer.
b)	To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.
The foregoing limited exclusion does not apply to any patent or invention covered by a contract between the Company and the United States or any of its agencies requiring full title to such patent or invention to be in the United States.
