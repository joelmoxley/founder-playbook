[COMPANY NAME]
[NON-COMPETITION AND] NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT 
This [Non-Competition and ] Non-Solicitation Agreement (this “Agreement”) made this [____] day of [_____________], 20[  ], is by and between [_____________], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and [____________] (the “Employee”).
For good consideration and in consideration of the employment or continued employment of the Employee by the Company, the Employee and the Company agree as follows:
1.	[Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.   
(a)	Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation .  While the Employee is employed by the Company and for a period of one (1) year after the termination or cessation of such employment for any reason, the Employee will not directly or indirectly:
			(i)	in the geographical areas that the Company does business or has done business at the time of the Employee’s termination, engage or assist others in engaging in any business or enterprise (whether as owner, partner, officer, director, employee, consultant, investor, lender or otherwise, except as the holder of not more than 1% of the outstanding stock of a publicly-held company) that is competitive with the Company’s business, including but not limited to any business or enterprise that develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, sells or provides any product or service that competes with any product or service developed, manufactured, marketed, licensed, sold or provided, or planned to be developed, manufactured, marketed, licensed, sold or provided, by the Company while the Employee was employed by the Company; or
			(ii)	either alone or in association with others, solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or take away, the business or patronage of any of the actual or prospective clients, customers, accounts or business partners of the Company which were contacted, solicited, or served by the Company during the Employee’s employment with the Company; or
			(iii)	either alone or in association with others (i) solicit, induce or attempt to induce, any employee or independent contractor of the Company to terminate his or her employment or other engagement with the Company, or (ii) hire or recruit, or attempt to hire or recruit, or engage or attempt to engage as an independent contractor, any person who was employed or otherwise engaged by the Company at any time during the term of the Employee’s employment with the Company; provided, that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the recruitment or hiring or other engagement of any individual whose employment or other engagement with the Company has been terminated for a period of six months or longer.
(b)	Extension.  If the Employee violates the provisions of any of the preceding paragraphs of this Section 1, the Employee shall continue to be bound by the restrictions set forth in such paragraph until a period of one (1) year has expired without any violation of such provisions.
(c)	Notice of New Business Activity.  The Employee agrees that during the non-competition and non-solicitation period, the Employee will give notice to the Company of each new business activity the Employee  plans to undertake, at least (10) business days prior to beginning any such activity.  The notice shall state the name and address of the individual, corporation, association or other entity or organization (“Entity”) for whom such activity is undertaken and the name of the Employee’s business relationship or position with the entity.  The Employee further agrees to provide the Company with other pertinent information concerning such business activity as the Company may reasonably request in order to determine the Employee’s continued compliance with his/her obligations under this Agreement.]
2.	Miscellaneous.
(a)	Equitable Remedies.  The Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of the Company and are considered by the Employee to be reasonable for such purpose.  The Employee agrees that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement is likely to cause the Company substantial and irrevocable damage which is difficult to measure.  Therefore, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to such other remedies which may be available, shall have the right to obtain an injunction from a court restraining such a breach or threatened breach without posting a bond and the right to specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement and the Employee hereby waives the adequacy of a remedy at law as a defense to such relief.
(b)	Obligations to Third Parties.  The Employee represents that, except as the Employee has disclosed in writing to the Company, the Employee is not bound by the terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party to refrain from competing, directly or indirectly, with the business of such previous employer or any other party, or to refrain from soliciting employees, customers or suppliers of such previous employer or other party.  The Employee further represents that his/her performance of all the terms of this Agreement and the performance of his/her duties as an employee of the Company does not and will not conflict with or breach any agreement with any prior employer or other party (including, without limitation, any non-competition agreement).  
(c)	Disclosure of this Agreement.  For a period of one year after the termination or cessation of the Employee’s employment for any reason, the Employee agrees to notify any potential, prospective employer or prospective business associate, of the terms and existence of this Agreement and the Employee’s continuing obligations to the Company hereunder.
(d)	Not Employment Contract.  The Employee acknowledges that this Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment, does not imply that the Company will continue his/her employment for any period of time and does not change the at-will nature of his/her employment.
(e)	Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any corporation with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to the Company’s assets or business, provided, however, that the obligations of the Employee are personal and shall not be assigned by him or her.  The Employee expressly consents to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement for the benefit of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to whose employ the Employee may be transferred without the necessity that this Agreement be re-signed at the time of such transfer.  
(f)	Interpretation.  If any restriction set forth in Section 1 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.
(g)	Severability.  In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.
(h)	Waivers.  No delay or omission by the Company in exercising any right under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of that or any other right.  A waiver or consent given by the Company on any one occasion is effective only in that instance and will not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right on any other occasion.
(i)	Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the [State/Commonwealth of __________] (without reference to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof).  Any action, suit, or other legal proceeding which is commenced to resolve any matter arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement shall be commenced only in a court of the [State/Commonwealth of __________] (or, if appropriate, a federal court located within [____________]), and the Company and the Employee each consents to the jurisdiction of such a court.  [The Company and the Employee each hereby irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement.] 
(j)	Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the Employee and the Company relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.  This Agreement may not be modified, changed or discharged in whole or in part, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Employee and the Company.  The Employee agrees that any change or changes in his/her duties, salary or compensation after the signing of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.
(k)	Captions.  The captions of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, limit or affect the scope or substance of any section of this Agreement.
