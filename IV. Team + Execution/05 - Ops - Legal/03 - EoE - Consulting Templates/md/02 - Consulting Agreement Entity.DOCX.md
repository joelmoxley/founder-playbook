The Consultant and its Employees agree, therefore, that, in addition to any other remedy it may have, the Company shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance of this Agreement by the Consultant and its Employees and to seek both temporary and permanent injunctive relief (to the extent permitted by law) without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond.

18.	Non-Assignability of Contract.  The Consultant shall not have the right to assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties without the express written consent of the Company.  Any non-consented-to assignment or delegation, whether express or implied or by operation of law, shall be void and shall constitute a breach and a default by the Consultant.
19.	Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the [State/Commonwealth of __________] without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction.

21.	Interpretation.

22.	Survival.  Sections 4 through 23 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
23.	Miscellaneous.
23.1	No delay or omission by the Company in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right.  A waiver or consent given by the Company on any one occasion shall be effective only in that instance and shall not be construed as a bar or waiver of any right on any other occasion.
23.2	The captions of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, limit or affect the scope or substance of any section of this Agreement.
23.3	In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.
