2.	Compensation. Advisor shall not be entitled to receive cash compensation; however, Advisor shall be entitled to receive the equity compensation indicated on the signature page hereto at an exercise or purchase price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock, which will be documented in the applicable Stock Option Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement to be entered into by Advisor and the Company as contemplated on the signature page hereto.

In connection with any reasonable travel and related expenses incurred in the course of performing services hereunder in which Advisor desires to be reimbursed,  Advisor shall provide written notice to the Company in advance describing the nature and maximum amount of such expense (email notice shall be sufficient).

4.	Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall continue until terminated by either party for any reason upon five (5) days prior written notice without further obligation or liability. 

5.	Independent Contractor. Advisor’s relationship with the Company will be that of an independent contractor and not that of an employee. Advisor will not be eligible for any employee benefits, nor will the Company make deductions from payments made to Advisor for employment or income taxes, all of which will be Advisor’s responsibility. Advisor will have no authority to enter into contracts that bind the Company or create obligations on the part of the Company without the prior written authorization of the Company.

6.	Nondisclosure of Confidential Information.

a.	Agreement Not to Disclose. Advisor agrees not to use any Confidential Information (as defined below) disclosed to Advisor by the Company for Advisor’s own use or for any purpose other than to carry out discussions concerning, and the undertaking of, the Services.

Upon request by the Company, any materials or documents that have been furnished by the Company to Advisor in connection with the Services shall be promptly returned by Advisor to the Company.

b.	Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any information, technical data or know-how (whether disclosed before or after the date of this Agreement), including, but not limited to, information relating to business and product or service plans, financial projections, customer lists, business forecasts, sales and merchandising, human resources, patents, patent applications, computer object or source code, research, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, marketing or finance to be confidential or proprietary or which information would, under the circumstances, appear to a reasonable person to be confidential or proprietary. Confidential Information does not include information, technical data or know-how that: (i) is in the possession of Advisor at the time of disclosure, as shown by Advisor’s files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; or (ii) becomes part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a direct or indirect result of any improper inaction or action of Advisor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Advisor may disclose Confidential Information with the prior written approval of the Company or pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body.

Advisor’s obligation to assist the Company shall continue beyond the termination of Advisor’s relationship with the Company, but the Company shall compensate Advisor at a reasonable rate after the termination of such relationship for time actually spent at the Company’s request providing such assistance. 

10.	Company’s Right to Disclose.  The Company shall have the right to disclose the existence of this Agreement, Advisor’s status as an Advisor, and to include Advisor’s name, image and profile in various promotional materials, including, but not limited to, executive summaries and the Company’s world wide web page.

11.	No Conflicts. Advisor represents that Advisor’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement and provision of Services hereunder will not violate any duty which Advisor may have to any other person or entity (such as a present or former employer), and Advisor agrees that Advisor will not do anything in the performance of Services hereunder that would violate any such duty. In addition, Advisor agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, Advisor shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any direct competitor of the Company which Advisor is also performing services. It is understood that in such event, the Company will review whether Advisor’s activities are consistent with Advisor remaining as an advisor of the Company. 

12.	Miscellaneous. Any term of this Agreement may be amended or waived only with the written consent of the parties. So long as you continue to serve as an advisor to the Company, you hereby consent to the Company including your name on its marketing materials, Web site or private placement memo, or offering materials as an advisor of the Company.

The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State listed on the signature page, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.
