4. Hiring and Firing
5. Governance & Corporate Formalities

    * All work done for the company belongs to the company, including all IP
    * All company information to remain confidential
    * Require listing of prior inventions

Facebook

3 – Issuing Equity
Stock = Control and Economic Interest  
* Allocate stock based on relative contribution (unequal split is okay)
  * Don’t assume that everyone will stay forever.

  * Do you need a stockholder agreement?
  * Do you want employment contracts?

Issuing Equity (cont.)
Equity Compensation  
* Options, warrants, restricted stock are important “currency” for start-ups low on cash, but . . .
* Be mindful of your cap table; once a stockholder, a stockholder for life
* Be aware of tax consequences
  * Generally, exercise price for options must be “fair market value” on date of grant; if not, can affect recipient AND the Company



4 – Hiring & Firing
Hiring
* “Employee” vs. “Independent Contractor”
  * IRS 20-factor test
* “Exempt” vs. “Non-exempt”
  * Exempt: executive, professional, administrative and computer professional
  * Non-exempt: entitled to overtime
* Outsourced HR Services: Trinet, ADP, Sequoia, & Finance Services
* Invention Assignment Agreements & Specific Option Promises

Firing
* Remember to buy back unvested shares 
* Don’t pay severance without a release of claims



5 – Governance & Corporate Formalities
* Corporation is a separate person
  * To get limited liability, owners must honor the formalities

* Piercing Corp. Veil (disregarding corp. entity)
  * Court will pierce veil when owner abuses corp. form
    * Operating corp. in purely individual capacity
    * Co-mingling of funds
    * Not holding board meetings or preparing meeting minutes
    * Undercapitalization



6 – Securities Laws
