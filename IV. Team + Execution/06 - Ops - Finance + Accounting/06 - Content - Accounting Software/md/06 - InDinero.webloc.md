Our Story.

When we started inDinero back in 2009, we knew that we wanted to build a company that would be dedicated to helping business owners and entrepreneurs. From starting our own businesses in the past, we knew that running the back-office was a major distraction, and working with technically challenged accountants was no fun at all. Of all industries out there, accounting and tax was one of very few that had yet to be modernized. And even today, we find it odd that there are still accountants who run QuickBooks out of their basement!

From then on, we've had our hearts set on building a company that would stand for helping fellow entrepreneurs. We didn't just want to build accounting software... we wanted to completely change the way that business owners think about their operations, and taking care of all of their back-office affairs is our way of doing that.

Today, inDinero supports hundreds of businesses across the United States, and we're on a mission to support them as they grow.

Dazzling Our Clients

Have you ever been in a tough situation where you were reliant on the assistance of a stranger, only to have them completely take the weight off your shoulders and make the problem disappear?
That’s our goal, every time.

Rethinking the Obvious

How do successful people work out problems and blaze trails? They question the things others have widely accepted. We encourage our team members to poke holes in stale processes because “but we’ve always done it this way” is a great way to repeat age old mistakes.

Radical Candor

Feedback isn’t easy for everyone, but it's a necessary part of building a strong team and healthy place to work. Radical Candor sits at the intersection of caring personally and challenging directly, so the intention is always humble and helpful, the delivery is immediate, and the content doesn’t personalize.
