Wave engineers make free software

We're hiring in Toronto Finance software for small businesses

In 2010, as a scrappy bootstrapped startup, we made our entrance with an industry-changing application: free, easy online accounting software made for small businesses.

From that foundation, we’ve grown to a full suite of award-winning financial services and software.

We’ve hand-picked the top talent in engineering, design, data science, customer success and more, to build one of the most exciting Fintech companies anywhere.

Based in Toronto’s Leslieville neighborhood, the Wave team is more than 130 people strong and growing fast.


We’re solving problems for small business owners and freelancers on every continent.


We take pride in our accomplishments, in our teamwork, and in the company culture we’ve created together. Learn more about the Wave team, or better yet, join us.
