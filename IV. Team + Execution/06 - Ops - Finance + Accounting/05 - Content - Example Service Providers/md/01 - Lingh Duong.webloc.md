Linh Duong

When I took my first accounting class in college I knew exactly what my career path would be. Before starting Bettelon, Duong & Parrish LLP, an accounting and tax firm in Palo Alto, I had worked at several local CPA firms and hi-tech start- up companies in the bay area where I gained valuable experience in the area of accounting, tax and finance.

What I value the most in my career as a CPA is the relationship that I have developed with my clients over the years. I thoroughly enjoyed assisting them with proper planning which enabled them to make the right financial decision. I also tried to navigate them through our complex tax law and helped them solve their unique tax issues and prepared their tax returns. My clientele consist of individuals with domestic or international tax issues, trusts, estate and small businesses, including hi-tech start-ups. To be able to take the worries off our clients' minds relating to tax matters is my goal.

Besides playing with the numbers and the tax code, I also like to paint and draw and enjoy swimming. I am married and have 3 children.
