Newton is the brainchild of recruiting professionals who launched the product in 2009 after having run hundreds of high-performance recruiting programs across the US. Their goal wasn’t to revolutionize recruiting, it was to create an ATS that was easy-to-use, easy-to-implement, and affordable for any size of company regardless of how fast they were growing.
