II. Getting Started as a Corporate Entity

A . Obtain a Federal Tax ID and State Employer Number

To obtain a Federal Tax ID number, complete and file IRS Form SS-4 (http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/lists/0,,id=97817,00.html). Obtain a State Employer Number by completing and filing the appropriate form. A link to downloadable forms for any state can by found at: http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/link/forms.html (for California, file Form DE-1 with the Franchise Tax Board).

B . Establish a Full-Service Commercial Banking Relationship

Establish a full-service commercial banking relationship encompassing commercial checking, on-line balance tracking, and electronic funds transfer services. Also, establish a money market account into which cash in excess of 30 days requirements can be invested to earn interest income. In most cases, all of these services can be obtained from one institution. It is extremely important to establish a disciplined approach to managing cash resources. For a Sample Investment Policy Guideline, see the Appendix.

C . Set Up Your Payroll Service

Contract with an on-line payroll service that will establish regular payroll processing, tax reporting, automatic deposits of amounts 
withheld from employee paychecks, and other specialized reporting services. Leading service providers include Intuit, ADP, and Paychex.

D . Develop Internal Controls

Establish basic policies and procedures as the initial step in creating a system of internal control. Include:

1. Cash management and control policy identifying:
a) Recommended check signers and authorization levels. See Check Signing and Wire Transfer Authorization Policy in the Appendix..
b) Segregation of duties surrounding cash-related transactions such as: A/P vouchering, issuance of checks, reconciliation of the monthly bank statements, custody of petty cash, issuance of customer sales invoices, and posting of customer cash receipts.
2. Recommended purchasing policy, and guidelines and procedure for the issuance of purchase orders (POs), including approval authorization guidelines and signature controls, tracking and approval of materials received, and completion of services in accordance with authorized POs. See Sample Purchase Order Policy in the Appendix.
3. Recommended travel authorization and expense reimbursement policies. See Sample Travel Authorization and Expense Reimbursement Policy in the Appendix.
4. Recommended capital equipment and investment policy. See Sample Fixed Asset Capitalization Policy in the Appendix.
5. Guidelines for engagement of independent contractors for temporary or project-related resources. Consult legal counsel and accounting professionals to insure compliance with employer payroll tax guidelines. The goal is to avoid misclassification of payments to contractors and insure that unanticipated payroll taxes and workers’ compensation insurance liabilities are not incurred.

E . Signature Authorization Policy

Establish a signature authorization policy approved by the Board of Directors, setting approval guidelines and limits for: purchasing, staff additions, compensation, travel, and other contract commitments.
1. Communicate this policy in writing to key personnel.
2. Identify each person in the authority matrix based on existing staff.
3. Update at regular intervals.

III. Installing Essential Accounting and Finance Infrastructure

A . Accounting Software

Set up the basic accounting and finance infrastructure on a traditional PC based or web-enabled accounting software solution, to include:
1. A General Ledger with a chart of accounts tailored to a typical semiconductor company. See Sample Chart of Accounts in the
Appendix.
2. Cash Management function with on-line tracking and other bank-related information.
3. An Accounts Payable module linked to a vendor master and open PO file, as well as open-item tracking and aging analysis functions.

B . Basic Accounting Policies and Procedures

Establish the basic accounting policies and procedures for the following:
* Fiscal accounting calendar.
* Payroll.
* Accounts payable.
* General ledger maintenance.
* Cash management.
* Accounts receivable.
* Fixed assets and depreciation. See Sample Fixed Asset Capitalization

Policy in the Appendix.

C. Financial Reporting Policy

Establish financial reporting policy, including:

1. Recommended report formats:
* P&L. See Sample Monthly P&L Report in the Appendix.
* Balance sheet. See Sample Monthly Balance Sheet in the Appendix.
* Analysis of cash flow. See Sample Monthly Analysis of Cash Flow in the Appendix.
* Operating expense by function.
* Plan comparisons and analyses, such as actual versus plan/budget with “waterfall” tracking and concise narrative explanations of significant variances. See Sample Monthly Waterfall Reporting in the
Appendix.
2. Reporting frequency and time deadlines:
3. Typically, key metrics such as cash status and operating results are reported at least monthly at staff meetings, in order to accommodate questions and feedback dialogue in real time. A well-organized accounting cycle will allow reporting of final data with comparisons to plan/budget within 10 calendar days from the end of the prior accounting period.
4. Control and distribution of confidential data.
5. Supporting detail/sub-ledgers and reconciliation integrity.

D . Staffing

Evaluate the complexity and workload associated with the accounting function. Decide whether to recruit and hire a qualified staff or select an outsourced service provider (a typical staff matrix is shown in the Timeline Overview). This is an iterative, qualitative process, with daily requirements evolving in concert with the growth and development of the business.

E . Hiring a CPA Firm

Solicit, evaluate, and select a licensed certified public accounting (CPA) firm to conduct annual audits of financial records and systems of internal controls. If the accounting and control environment is sufficiently complex, a formal RFP process may be justified to insure that all relevant issues are clearly communicated for prospective service providers.

Wherever possible, the CPA firm should be qualified to assist the company in the preparation and timely filing of annual income tax returns and benefits plan compliance reports.

The appointment of the CPA firm must be approved by the Board of Directors (subject to ratification by shareholder vote in most cases). 

Solicit competitive bids from multiple firms. Negotiate a predetermined fee for these services on an annual basis. If budgets and staffing allow, the audit firm should perform a review (at least once per year) of the financial reports, systems, and controls. Pertinent observations should be documented in a letter to the CEO and Board of Directors. When the company’s business approaches the scale sufficient to begin considering a filing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), the independent auditor reviews should be increased to quarterly.

F . Control of Fixed Assets

Establish physical control of the Company’s fixed assets:
1. Each purchased item at or above capitalization cost levels and with qualifying useful life shall be entered in a fixed assets log or database when placed in service. Costs incurred for capital equipment requiring assembly of multiple components, special site preparation, or freight must be collected in a temporary cost ledger and consolidated as one item at completion for the purpose of physical control and tracking.
2. Affix individual pre-numbered tags or labels to each capitalized item.
3. Maintain a database log that records issuance of fixed assets by tag number, as each asset is placed in service, and lists original cost and person responsible for each item.

G . Employment Policy

Establish a fundamental employment policy and guidelines for engagement of independent contractors. Seek expert advice from a tax accountant and obtain rules and criteria used to determine employee versus independent contractor status.

1. Utilize legal guidance to insure proper classification of wages, payroll taxes, and workers’ compensation insurance coverage.
2. For temporary and part-time employees, set guidelines for eligibility under group insurance and other benefits.

H . Control of Stock Certificates

Establish and maintain control of the issuance of the company’s capital stock certificates and maintain secure audit-able records.
1. Seek advice of Corporate Counsel to initiate printing and control of stock certificates.
2. Maintain a stock book of record, indicating owner names, addresses and denomination of each share certificate.
3. Compile a capital stock capitalization summary table by class, indicating total issued and outstanding shares as well as shares reserved for issuance under stock option plans. This compilation must be regularly updated to ensure it is accurate and audit-able at all times.
4. Draft a detailed employee incentive stock option plan in compliance with Articles of Incorporation/Bylaws, to be approved by the Board of Directors and ratified by shareholder vote.
5. Obtain approval of the Board of Directors, or the Compensation Committee comprised of outside directors, prior to granting of employee stock options.

IV. Implementing Company-wide Financial Planning Discipline

A . Strategic Plan

Develop a summary-level five-year Strategic Plan for update and approval annually by the Board of Directors.
1. Start with the company’s initial seed-level funding proposal to create a more comprehensive planning document. Include a description of the proprietary IP, and product differentiation that will create or expand upon a measurable market opportunity.
2. Focus on refining the company’s vision and major overriding objectives to be achieved in the five-year time horizon.
3. State the principal strategy to deliver results, given a well defined set of assumptions or anticipated market conditions.
4. Develop financial projections consistent with the main components of the Strategic Plan outlined above.

B . Annual Operating Plan

Develop an Annual Operating Plan (See Sample Annual Operating Plan Timeline in the Appendix), with an integrated methodology linking annual objectives to those established in the five-year Strategic Plan.
1. Gather market intelligence from reliable third-party sources, prepare the current situation analysis, and define multiple planning scenarios.
2. Define the annual corporate objectives and principal strategy, building consensus at all levels.
3. Once top-level goals are set, develop cascaded goals for each functional responsibility or line organization, with commitments from responsible staff.
4. Develop detailed staffing plans, operating expense budgets, sales projections, product shipment projections, and manufacturing and
fulfillment cost projections.
5. Consolidate and finalize the financial plan linked to the execution of strategy and attainment of objectives.
6. Conduct internal executive review and approval, and then submit to the Board of Directors for review, approval, and adoption.
7. Integrate detailed financial budgets and operating targets into regular financial reporting methodology as a basis for actual performance measurement and feedback.

V. Facilities and Security Arrangements in Support of Business Expansion

A . Office Space

Determine office and operations space requirements sufficient to support the company’s operations for at least 24 months. A general guideline is to allow about 250 square feet for each employee, with separate consideration for lab space, warehouse, and shipping/receiving dock.

B . Leasing

Select a location and negotiate a lease for an appropriate term. If financing of tenant improvements is required, select the lowest cost alternative (explore options for landlord financing with costs amortized into the lease payment versus external financing sources). Other critical negotiation points in commercial lease agreements are likely to include:
1. Term and options to extend, conditions of early termination, and ability to sublease.
2. Lease costs, subject to cost of living adjustment.
3. Tenant/landlord responsibility to maintain and pay the costs of liability insurance. This insurance should cover damage to the building and personal property from all risks, subject to possible exclusions for flood, earthquake, acts of God, etc.
4. Tenant/landlord responsibility for regular building maintenance and landscaping expenses.
5. Parking privileges, signage, multiple tenant building access, and other parcel-specific issues.

C . Corporate Document Control

Maintaining sound record keeping and file retention discipline are both extremely important. Conducting annual audits, defending litigation claims or threats, supporting investor due diligence, and filing for an Initial Public Offering are examples of major corporate milestone activities that will require efficient and extensive access to critical files and records. Begin by establishing secure physical files on the premises and assign an employee as custodian of key records such as: material agreements, certified Board of Directors meeting minutes, capital stock records, confidential HR files, licenses, etc.

D . Risk Management

1. Solicit quotes, and acquire property and casualty insurance coverage at appropriate levels and deductibles. Coverage limits and premium costs are ostensibly tied to the value of the Company’s tangible assets and revenue run-rate. Review coverage limits and deductibles for general liability and business interruption coverage at least once per year. Consult with the insurance broker or utilize outside experts to guarantee a thorough and comprehensive analysis.

2. Implement data protection measures including daily backup of computer files, and remote storage of backup media containing copies of critical data such as financial records, computer source code, and design files.

VI. Expanded Financial Management of Operations and Related Issues

The following must be developed and implemented prior to the Company reaching the initial commercialization and revenue phase:

A . Pricing Policy

Establish pricing policy and controls for products and services. Key points to consider include:
* Issuance of a standard pricing schedule (may require internal and “external” lists that can be viewed by customers).
* Override procedure and approval authority for special cases.
* Overlay of competitive pricing status compiled by marketing staff.
* Underlying cost dynamics compiled by finance staff as key ingredients to the decision process.

B . Customer Credit Policy

Establish customer credit policies and related internal controls governing: order processing, ship authorization, credit limit authorization, and collections administration. Key points to consider include:
* Lead finance executive is responsible for setting credit policy and maintaining controls.
* Set credit limit amounts at levels appropriate for the customer’s credit worthiness and order backlog or anticipated monthly purchasing demand.
* Establish a consistent format for compiling reference-checking information.
* Use independent third-party credit information sources (such as D&B) for payment track record on like commodities for prospective customers, and to enhance internally-generated credit information.

C . Inventory Management Policy

Establish inventory management and control policy and physical control measures:
1. Tracking and control must be tied to purchasing authorization, cost accounting, and credit/ship authorization policies.
2. Build and staff a secure warehouse as appropriate.
3. Sales demo, engineering, and/or prototype materials must be segregated and tracked.
4. Formulate state sales tax reporting and compliance policy, and procedure covering product shipments and internally consumed materials.

Establish a cross-functional master scheduling policy  to coordinate customer contract/backlog and credit status, and overall demand forecasting, with fulfillment. This policy should include repetitive purchasing of inventories, and manufacturing schedules and delivery mechanisms (MRP). This requirement comes to light when production volume begins to grow at a rapid rate and early-stage planning and control systems are pushed to their limit.

D . Warranty Policy

Establish customer return (RMA) and product warranty policy commensurate with industry practice and customer adoption stage. Procedures must be set to rapidly evaluate and segregate materials returned from customers and to process RMA lot tracking. Early diagnosis of the nature of the return is important, particularly to determine whether the repair is warranty-covered (company expense) or non-warranty (customer expense). To summarize the main role of Finance in controlling in-warranty returns and non-warranty returns:

1. Establish accurate visibility for all transactions impacting the assets of the company (returns to inventory) and proper inventory classification and valuation.
2. For in-warranty returns: maintain tracking of customer’s inventory as evaluation and/or repair is conducted.
3. For all RMA transactions: when shipment back to the customer is made, timely internal tracking and the complete cost of the warranty or repair effort for the transaction must be recorded.

E . Inventory Control Policy

Establish inventory control guidelines and measurement metrics such as: inventory turnover, slow-moving inventory, and other appropriate criteria. Appropriate inventory accounting valuation adjustments will be required as internal control and management accountability guidelines evolve. Inventory turnover is calculated as follows:
Turnover = [Annualized cost of goods sold] / Ending (or average) inventory value
Operating companies in the fab-less semiconductor industry typically target the inventory turnover ratio as follows:
Initial product, after 12 months of production: 10 – 12X
Multiple products, mature phase: 7 – 9 X.

VII. Working Capital and Equipment Lease Financing

Solicit and negotiate an asset-based loan facility with a financial institution, to fund working capital requirements and/or provide equipment- leasing arrangements as required.
* For an accounts receivable line of credit, be cognizant of the qualifying terms that will determine collateral eligibility in loan formulas, such as: aging, degree of concentration of the portfolio due from any one customer, eligibility for export customers, amounts due from related-party entities, or amounts due from creditors (cross-aging).
* Carefully analyze loan covenants and other financial restrictions that may be implicit in loan and security agreements.

VIII. Independent Audits and Corporate Governance

The CEO and CFO are responsible for directing the organization to respond to the requests of the independent audit firm, so as to deliver annual certified audited financial statements and reviews of internal controls on a timely basis and to avoid excessive (higher than anticipated) audit fees.

Establish a Corporate Governance policy with assistance from legal counsel. Appoint audit and compensation committees of the Board of Directors comprised of 100% outside directors if possible.
* Define roles and responsibilities at all levels.
* Establish accountabilities linking responsible executive officers with key personnel assigned to carry out functional duties.
* Establish linkage between responsible employees (officers) to relevant directors, outside counsel, and the company’s audit firm.
* Establish company-wide employee performance appraisal standards and policy, linked to compensation policy approved by the Board of Directors.
