ABOUT US

René Lacerte, CEO and Founder of Bill.com
Creating Magically Simple Business Payments
Bill.com is the leading digital business payments company creating magically simple A/P and A/R solutions. We are uniquely positioned at the center of business payments, uniting banks, accountants, and businesses on the fastest growing payments network.

Bill.com helps over 1,000,000 network members process over $25 billion in payments per year and saves companies up to 50 percent of the time typically spent on financial back-office operations by securely automating their end-to-end processes. Three of the top ten U.S. banks and 35 percent of the top 100 accounting firms rely on Bill.com as their primary payments solution.

The History of Bill.com
René Lacerte founded Bill.com in April 2006, bringing to the company more than 20 years experience in the finance, software and payments industries. Previously, he founded PayCycle, which became the industry’s leading online payroll service (acquired by Intuit in 2009).

While leading PayCycle, Lacerte recognized first-hand the need to simplify, consolidate and automate how business and finance professionals manage their payments processes for accounts payable, accounts receivable, and cash flow management tasks. He knew connecting all the players (executives, managers, clerks, vendors, customers and accountants) with built-in collaboration and communication tools would save time and improve efficiency. With all these insights in mind, Bill.com was born.

Our Culture
Bill.com is a values-driven company. Every day we strive to serve our customers and build our business following these values:
 
Humble
No ego.
 
Fun
Celebrate the moments.
 
Authentic
We are who we are.
 
Passionate
Love what you do.
 
Dedicated
To each other and the customer.
Our Customers
Bill.com serves small and mid-sized businesses. Our customer base is diverse. We serve small corner markets and multi-unit franchise operations. We have established mid-sized businesses and some of the hottest emerging tech startups.

Consumers have a number of digital payment options and a wide range of automated financial tools. Enterprise businesses have long enjoyed integrated back-end options. Until Bill.com, the small to mid-sized business market had few digital payment choices. Now Bill.com is the champion of businesses everywhere and we are committed to leaving no business behind.
