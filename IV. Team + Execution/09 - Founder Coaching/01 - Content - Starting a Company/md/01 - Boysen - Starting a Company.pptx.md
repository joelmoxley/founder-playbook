Surest sign to an unsuccessful start-up is winning a business plan competition


Fuel Cells  
what is a fuel cell?
hydrogen from the sun
alcohol
oil
catalyst
hydrogen from fuel H2
O2 oxygen from air
H2O water bi-product
electricity



History of Fuel Cells
more than 150 years and no mass adoption


Sir William Grove 1st fuel cell
Ludwig Mond & Charles Langer - coin "fuel cell"
Francis T. Bacon - 1st alkaline fuel cell (AFC)
General Electric - 1st polymer fuel cell (PEMFC) in Gemini space craft
WestingHouse - 1st solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
Texas Instruments 100 W Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) 
Allis-Chalmers -5kW phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC)
Union Carbide - AFC powered motorcycle
United Technologies - 40 kW PAFC
Ballard Systems - 100 kW PEMFC transit bus
Daimler Benz & Honda - PEMFC cars
Power Corporation - 250 kW MCFC 


2004, discovered solid acid fuel cells  first new type of fuel cell in 50 years


What is a solid acid?
* Intermediate salts and acids 
½ Cs2SO4+ ½ H2SO4  CsHSO4
* Physically similar to salts
  * Brittle
  * Water soluble
* Properties
  * Direct proton transport
  * Impermeable
  * Solid state 
  * Superprotonic

Arrhenius Plot of 
Solid Acid Proton Conductivity


Superprotonic Phase Transitions
Structural solid-solid phase transition (order-disorder)
Heat  100 -1000 fold increase in proton conductivity 
Superprotonic (σ ~ 10-2  Ω-1cm-1)
Oxy-anions “freely” rotate
Ordered
Normal Structure
heat
Disordered
Superprotonic


Proton Transport Mechanism (Grotthuss Mechanism)
1. Tetrahedral Reorientation
2.  Proton Transfer

liquid-like proton conduction in the solid state

We’re gonna be rich!



Begging the government for money


The Technology Valley of Death 
venture capital, the only game in town


We need a CEO


Getting venture capital (VC) to Sand Hill Road


Jun 2004, after nearly 100 pitches & 3 months we finally close our Series A ($4.5MM)


We build a fantastic team original Superprotonic Team
Founders
Thomas CEO
Sami VP Biz Dev
Zeka Sr. Scientist
Dan Jr Engineer
Rong Sr. Engineer
Vikki Office Mgr.
Matt VP Engineering
Alex Sr. Scientist
Mandy Lab Mgr.


We build a laboratory …money is flyin’ out the window
from lease to fully operational lab in 50 days

Workin’ hard typical weeks ~ 100 hours


15 min of fame
featured in PBS series called 'Curious'
Getting press doesn’t make it real


Dec 2006, we’re out of cash  time to raise more money


Jun 2007, we close Series B ($15MM)   
…and they axed our CEO


2008, decision to ramp up for manufacturing
…are we ready???



2008 New Superprotonic Team
note likeness




Rapid Technological Development
Li-ion Battery
< 0.2 Wh kg-1
~ $500/kWh
Solid Acid Fuel Cell
> 1.0 Wh kg-1
~ $5000/kWh
preliminary evaluation & negotiation with
big companies often want to date for 5 years before getting married


2009 Economic Crisis
DOW                 
Superprotonic dissolved
market crash


Dane’s Top Ten words of advice about starting a company
1. The only reason to start a business is to make money
2. Time is more valuable than money – make the most of it
3. Worship the holy trinity – team, market, technology (in that order)
4. You can never fire a bad employee fast enough
5. Figure out how to get to revenue in less than 1 year
6. Energy technology market adoption times >10 years
7. Success has a thousand fathers, failure is bastard child
8. There is no such thing as bad money – it is about timing
9. A patent is only a right to sue
10. Better to agree, than be right
