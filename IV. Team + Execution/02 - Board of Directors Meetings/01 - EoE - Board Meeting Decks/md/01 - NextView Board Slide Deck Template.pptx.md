How to Use This Resource
A few things to keep in mind to put this deck to proper use for your startup:

Use these slides to make board deck creation simpler and easier.
While each situation is different, we included the key pieces you should use, along with 	our opinions on what makes a great board deck. Use this directionally, but don’t simply copy/paste this resource.

This was built for seed-stage startups.
It’s not intended for use by later-stage startups but rather younger companies who have just raised their first round of funding. 

For some sections, we’ve offered multiple options to select.
We’ve used green splats (shown below) to indicate when one section has multiple options to choose from. Be sure to delete the options you don’t use.

(Note: To remove slide background elements, go to View > Master > Slide Master)

Throughout this resource, my partners and I offer some light commentary and opinions via these sticky notes. You’ll find them along the margins of a given slide.

About NextView Ventures

We’re a seed-stage venture capital firm investing in internet and mobile startups in primarily Boston and New York (though we invest throughout the US). Co-founders and partners Rob Go (eBay, Spark Capital), David Beisel (About.com, Venrock), and Lee Hower (LinkedIn, Point Judith Capital) focus exclusively on seed in order to better fulfill the firm’s mission, which is also the mission of this Growth Guide:

Help founders give their companies the best possible start.


1. Board Decks 101 Understanding the Basics


Important Board Deck Basics
Content
* Generally speaking, a good board deck is divided into housekeeping and major issues/topics.
* 20-30% of your meeting time should be housekeeping (at most). These are general updates that the board should know about or need to quickly discuss/approve.
* 50%+ of your meeting time should be major issues. These are the 1-3 key obstacles, priorities, or initiatives at your company that require more in-depth discussion.
* Your deck should include more than you plan to discuss in person, especially as your company scales and more data can be reported. The expectation is for all parties to read the deck in advance. As such, your deck is not a presentation aid but a more complete document that can be read and understood without much commentary. 

Design
* Keep things simple. Decks should be presentable, clean, and clear, but don’t agonize over beauty. Your board wants to focus on forward progress, not scrutinize your slide design. 
* Many directors and observers prefer all information sent in one file, so be sure to include screen shots from any spreadsheets or product mockups/features you’ll discuss.
* It’s best to send via PDF, but if you have to send via PowerPoint for some reason, use basic fonts and slide dimensions that all PPT versions and operating systems can cleanly read.

Remember to circulate your deck 1-2 days in advance.

how MAJOR DISCUSSION TOPICS change


Board Discussion Over Time
Pre-Product
Seed Round
Product-Market Fit
Revenue
Series A
Series B
Scale
 1. Product direction; key first hire(s); early discussion on Series A
 2. Go-to-market plans for product
 3. Product-market fit data/traction; Series A fundraise
 4. Sales and marketing (process, value prop language, hiring, etc.)
 5. Sales and marketing pipeline; product improvements; Series B fundraise
 6. Efficiencies; vertical growth; channels

The major issues should be the bulk of the agenda time. Topics usually depend on the stage of the startup. This slide is a rough approximation of how the topics might change.

2. Templates to Use Building Your Deck


Option 1: Full Slide Deck

Since the goal is to eventually scale into a larger business, at which point you more or less have to create board decks, I advise founders to start early and create full decks, even if they’ll be lean early on.
Lee Hower
Co-Founder & Partner
NextView Ventures



Company Logo
BOARD MEETING
MM.DD.YY

While you should feel free to use some unique branding and layout of your own, don’t spend tons of time designing and re-designing your board deck. The goal is clarity.

“Housekeeping” doesn’t mean “not important.” Finance is critical – it just appears on a recurring basis. Same with hiring, which fluctuates in volume and urgency.

Progress Dashboard
Option 1
Finance
* Cash: $N
* Burn Rate: $N
* Runway: X-Y months (worst case, assuming no revenue contribution)

Other Core Metrics*
* Key Update #1
* Key Update #2
* Key Update #3

Product
* Key Update #1
* Key Update #2
* Key Update #3

Other Core Metrics*
* Key Update #1
* Key Update #2
* Key Update #3

Finance updates should report similar data each meeting. Product should be ever-changing, but as a post-seed fundraise startup, you’re urgently seeking product-market fit.

Progress Dashboard
Option 2
Top Projects
* Product: Description of project.
* Biz Dev: Description of project.
* Sales/Marketing: Description of project.
* Ops: Description of project.
* Team: Description of project.

KPIs

There are many metrics you can and should report, but these change depending on your business and growth stage. Be sure to get your board’s input on important metrics.

Team Update
Amy
Co-Founder, CEO

Tyler

Jim

This can go in the front or back of the deck. I prefer front because it’s easier to get through quickly and focus the rest of the discussion on the 1-2 most important issues.

Team Compensation

Particularly for seed-stage startups, when every employee represents a large percent of the team, it’s important to get the board’s quick approval on new hire compensation.

About the Next Section
The following 3 slides are for Current Priorities. 

There are countless factors that alter the specifics of your Current Priorities slide, both in terms of content and layout. Because of this, we decided against proposing a single template version. 

Instead, we’ve included 3 different versions across specific situations:
A pre-launch startup.
A post-launch, pre-revenue consumer mobile startup.
And an early-revenue SaaS startup.

These are illustrative only!

They’ve been vetted by the partners at NextView and thus can be used to get a general sense of direction and level of detail, but DO NOT simply copy and paste them into your own deck.



Current Priorities
Design, build, and ship initial product

Identify alpha customers/users

Collect and analyze feedback
Improve feedback loop time/yield

Pre-Launch Startup

If your product is pre-launch, focus on the biggest possible levers to pull, and don’t invent priorities for the sake of the board meeting. Good investors know how raw this can be.
David Beisel
Co-Founder & Partner
NextView Ventures


Current Priorities
Early B2C Mobile
1. User engagement by cohort
* Day 1, Day 7, Day 30
2. Acquisition channels
* Early results by channel
* Planned experiments
* Target/new partnerships
3. Initial app updates
* Viral features



Current Priorities
Early-Revenue SaaS
1. Determine ideal/target customer persona
2. Accelerate customer acquisition
* Hire/train sales leadership/BDRs
* Top of Funnel: Double down on top lead-gen channels
* Middle of Funnel: Optimize conversion rates via email, website
* Watch revenue churn closely
3. Product enhancements to meet customer requirements



Key Concerns/Help Wanted
1. Concern/request #1
2. Concern/request #2
3. Concern/request #3

It’s crucial to be as transparent as possible early on. It both sets the tone for your board relationship and helps you gain valuable advice and support. Early board meetings aren’t simply investor updates.
Lee Hower
Co-Founder & Partner
NextView Ventures


Option 2: Running List
This approach helps you avoid overly formalized slides while keeping your board current on the business and the most pressing needs and priorities. Because the doc can be marked by all parties, it helps CEOs and board members have a productive, iterative discussion rather than a one-way information dump. 
Rob Go
Co-Founder & Partner
NextView Ventures


About the Next Section
Some seed-stage startups opt not to send slides. 

In fact, some investors prefer this approach. Instead of a full deck, you can opt to compile a running log of important updates, with a summary at the top, for investors to read and/or print. In some cases, your board may opt to annotate different sections before the meeting and flag various topics to discuss or clarify further.

Imagine the next few slides were one scrolling doc.
(Microsoft Word, Google Doc, etc.)

Note that multiple board meetings can be contained in the same doc, with the most recent placed at the top.


(Create in Microsoft Word or Google Docs.)
(Company Name) Board Meeting
MM.DD.YY.
High Level Summary
Option 1 (delete this)
