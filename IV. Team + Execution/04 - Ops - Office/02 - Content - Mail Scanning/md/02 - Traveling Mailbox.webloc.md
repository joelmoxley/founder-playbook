What Our Customers Say:

I am extremely happy with the Traveling Mailbox service and I use it because I am currently traveling full time.  When I decide to stop traveling and put down some roots I will continue using the service because I get ZERO junk mail and it is more environment friendly than the alternative.  You guys are always quick to process requests and forward mail and it is greatly appreciated.

TM is helping us manage our responsibilities in America from Morocco as we work in the US Peace Corps.  We have had great service so far!
- Barbara

Best service by far I have ever encountered. Ever since I changed my address and took my local post office out of the loop I can rest assured that my mail is being delivered effectively once again. The ease of use of the online console is very important and useful as well.
