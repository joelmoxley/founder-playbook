Hero City
AN ECOSYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS AND INSPIRES THE NEXT GENERATION OF WORLD CHANGING ENTREPRENEURS


Hero City Difference
In a sea of co-working spaces, Hero City stands out.  Hero City was designed by legendary VC, Tim Draper.  Tim Draper envisioned not just a space but an ecosystem that would inspire and support the next generation of world changing entrepreneurs.

VC Network
At Hero City we know what entrepreneurs really need: access to our global network of VC’s and funds.  Full-time Hero City members get three meetings with our VC’s each month.  This in-house access will set you apart from your competitor.

Events
Hero City members have access to exclusive events, speakers, and content from Draper University.  These events showcase both established and emergent leaders in the startup space.  Learn the best practices from today’s most innovative entrepreneurs.
Community

Hero City is much more than a co-working space.  It is a community of world changing entrepreneurs located in the heart of San Mateo.  With weekly snacks and monthly lunches, our members share ideas and build community.  The Hero City campus is filled with the buzz of aspiring entrepreneurs and corporate innovators from around the world.  Hero City is the place to build, launch and scale your company.

Professional Expertise
Access to capital only represents one part of the entrepreneurial journey.  At Hero City our members are granted free monthly consultations with our lawyers and accountants.  These services help early stage companies save on vital services and accelerate their growth.  

Other Amenities
At Hero City, our members have access to executive-level conference rooms, pop-up retail space, a media studio and an amphitheater.


Tim Draper
Tim Draper, the Founder of Draper University, is the Founding Partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a premier global venture capital firm that has funded companies like Hotmail, Skype, Baidu, Tesla, and Parametric Technology. Throughout his 27-year career, Draper has spread entrepreneurship by setting up venture funds and training teams all over the world.


Draper University
Located in Silicon Valley, Draper University of Heroes is the brainchild of free-spirited venture capitalist Tim Draper, aka “The Riskmaster”. We are an unconventional world-class boarding school for the brightest young entrepreneurs from around the world. We built this school because the world needs more heroes.
