WHY WEWORK:

WORKSPACE

COMMUNITY

Whether it's getting feedback on your product in real time, asking for a recommendation on a service provider, or simply grabbing a beer after work, the power of our community is invaluable.

CONNECT, LEARN, AND GROW

Events are an essential part of the WeWork experience. From regularly scheduled office hours with venture capitalists or other industry professionals, to tequila tasting happy hours with the whole community, we know how to work, and we know how to have fun. There are events, both social and professional, happening every day to help you build and maintain a strong team culture. RSVP at anytime to any event on the Member Network or WeWork app.

SERVICES
Our goal is to support our community however we can. When you're a smaller team facing a certain level of risk, it can be difficult to get a good rate from service providers. We understood that, and went to our partners to negotiate rates on behalf of our entire global community. That means the second your team joins WeWork, you get to take advantage of lower costs on things like healthcare and HR solutions from TriNet, money-saving benefits on payment processing with Chase, and shipping discounts with UPS.
