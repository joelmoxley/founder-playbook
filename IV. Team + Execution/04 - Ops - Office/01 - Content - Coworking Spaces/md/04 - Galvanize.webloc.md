Our Mission
We believe in making education and growth accessible to anyone – especially underrepresented groups in the tech industry. Whether you’re a founder, student, or just someone who wants to level up their career, we want Galvanize to be a welcoming, inclusive place where you can take the next step in your journey.


Our Community
Traditionally, industry and education have existed in separate worlds. At Galvanize, we’re bridging this longstanding gap by bringing industry partners, ambitious students, world-class education, and passionate founders under one roof. This is the Galvanize community.


Our Story

Our founders, Jim Deters, Lawrence Mandes, and Chris Onan, started Galvanize in 2012 with a bold vision: build a community to provide entrepreneurs and learners with life-changing opportunities for growth. Technology has made it possible for anyone with fortitude and resourcefulness to change the world for the better. Galvanize is the fuel to propel anyone to level up.

What We Believe in
Galvanize campuses are home to an eclectic mix of entrepreneurs, skilled programmers, expert data scientists, and men and women motivated to make an impact. As different and diverse as we all are, we’re united by common values.

Be Driven | Don’t be afraid to push yourself & work hard.

Be Curious | Always ask questions. Always be learning.

Be Inclusive | Seek out & embrace diversity.
