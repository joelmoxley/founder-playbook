About Us

Founder Habitat was started for Stanford entrepreneurs by a group of Alumni from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
The simple but ambitious goal is to help improve the odds of success for ventures started by Stanford students, faculty and alumni.  We do so by offering specific and practical help to common but significant problems faced by startups.
Through our unique problem solving approach we help startups overcome major hurdles much faster than they could otherwise on their own.
The selected ventures receive free work space and a pairing with mentors who are incentivized to help break through these challenges. 
Founder Habitat is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping Stanford entrepreneurs reach their goals. It currently offers various resources and support for startups at no fee and no equity. 


How we do it

* Space: Early stage startups need a habitat where they can be supported and nurtured towards their goals. Founder Habitat  offers office space and other infrastructure on a no leasing fee basis.  Read more about it  here.
* Mentors: Our mentors are problem solvers with a clear focus on delivering outcomes. They will not only give you specific advise but they will also work with you to break through the critical bottlenecks you face.
* Co-founders: Often time the success of a venture depends on the ability to form the right team. If you are looking for specific skills to add to your team, we will help locate someone interested in working with you as a Co-founder.
* Seed Technologies:  Companies spend billions of dollars in R&D. Sometimes, companies lack resources or the ability to convert these technologies into new products or operate new startups. Some of these technologies, supported by know how, can be powerful solutions to problems in other industries. Entrepreneurs can find other applications that were not considered originally. Founder Habitat has a portfolio of such technologies sourced from its industry partners. Read more about Seed Technologies here. 
* Funded Challenges: Companies across the world have begun to understand the critical role that entrepreneurs play in their ecosystem. Many big problems that large companies face are often solved by entrepreneurs sitting outside the company. Founder Habitat's industry partners bring up such problems in form of Funded Challenges and Founder Habitat helps entrepreneus solves such problems. Each Funded Challenge comes with an investment commitment from the industry partner. You can read more about Funded Challenges here.
