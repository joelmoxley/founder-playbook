Moving my company to Silicon Valley Pad was one of the best business decisions I’ve made. The Pad allows entrepreneurs to accelerate their businesses by offering: convenient and affordable work spaces of any size, conference rooms that are simple to reserve, IT support, a great staff to greet guests and distribute mail, a business network, and free snacks and drinks 24/7. I can't say enough about how much The Pad has simplified my life!

I've been at The Pad for 1.5 years now and I love it. They have great service, a nice, professional facility, and are conveniently located. My only regret is that I didn't find The Pad sooner. I highly recommend it!

ABOUT US

The Pad was created to ensure ease and simplicity. Working with and for startups, we realized what a hassle it could be to find office space; from signing up for a long term lease to the hidden costs and fees associated, it was not a good area to establish a startup. So we created The Pad where you can scale up and down as needed.

The Pad is a space that thrives on the creativity and ambiance fashioned from within our own community of targeted tech startups and serial entrepreneurs. Sit side by side with web developers, cloud app enthusiasts, brand management teams, coders, and marketing developers all the while gaining insight, inspiration, and motivation to disrupt the business YOU are in.

We are the coworking and innovation center that simply works for you.
