WHO WE ARE

Sandbox is a shared workspace created specifically for freelancers, small business owners, telecommuters and other independent professionals. We understand that while working for yourself can be liberating and satisfying, without the right facility, it can also be unproductive and lonely. We know from experience that it’s hard to keep a professional profile while working from your couch. The couch is no place to build an empire. Enter Sandbox.

With four locations, in San Francisco: SOMA, South Park and Union Square as well as Downtown Berkeley, Sandbox allows independent professionals to have a full-service, shared office and meeting space no matter where they happen to be with the added benefit of a supportive community of other independent professionals. Sandbox offers several levels of memberships that include month-to-month, virtual, part-time, full-time, private desk and private offices as well as daily drop-ins and on-demand meeting rooms!
