  Breakthrough Energy Ventures Insurance Play Book
 
 Introduction
Emerging growth companies must have a sharp focus on risks and opportunities as they enter into new and unknown territory. They have unique risks. As companies move from start-up through growth to maturity, risk intelligent leadership teams recognize the need for the early identification of key risks and the establishment of mitigation plans to address them.
Risk management and insurance must evolve as risks evolve. To get ahead of disruptive risk, organizations need to develop a proactive risk management program which:
• Pursues the opportunities that risk presents while protecting existing assets
• Creates strategic flexibility while maintaining operational discipline
• Provides assurance to senior executives and the board that risks have been addressed
Insurance coverage is an important tool in managing risk. The following pages will:
• Explain the necessary types of insurance for the various phases of a new/existing portfolio company’s development
• Outline our recommended process for putting the necessary insurance coverages in place

 Standards for Management Liability Limits
Key Management Liability lines of insurance (i.e., Directors’ & Officers’ Liability and Employment Practices Liability) are sometimes purchased with a combined aggregate limit of liability for both lines of coverage together. In these situations, it is important to select a limit sufficient to respond to the individual D&O exposures as well as corporate EPL exposures. Be sure to select an insurance company that has a financial rating of “A-XII” (A.M. Best) or better.
Elements that factor into the D&O limits decision:
• Industry sector (i.e. bio-tech, financial services, energy are higher risk)
• Corporate financials, including balance sheet assets and corporate revenue
• Employee count (as majority of claims against private companies are employment related) • International reach
• Cost
Early stage companies typically carry between $1M - $10M in D&O limits . This large spread arises from difference in board composition, balance sheet strength, M&A activity, industry sector, investor-based influence, IPO plans, etc. On average, a $3M limit is typical for many private companies with outside investors.
General guide for limits:
• $1 million minimum D&O limits for pre-revenue companies
• $2 million minimum D&O limits for revenue-generating companies with less than $10M in revenue
• $3 million minimum D&O limits for revenue-generating companies with more than $10 million revenue, with greater amounts for
companies with international exposure, heavily regulated industries, large employee bases, and large levels of strategic activity • $2 million minimum for companies located outside the US. Sometimes more is required, depending on the
     jurisdiction.
