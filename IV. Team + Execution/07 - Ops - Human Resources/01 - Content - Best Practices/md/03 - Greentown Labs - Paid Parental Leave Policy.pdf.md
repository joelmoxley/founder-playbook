Paid Parental Leave Policy

Policy Statement
Greentown Labs recognizes the importance of supporting new parents and is committed to aligning our people policies with the realities of the modern family. This policy is designed to make meaningful paid leave benefits available to colleagues who are new parents due to the birth, adoption, or placement in foster care of a child and qualify as “Eligible Employees,” as defined below. Further, this policy will supersede any prior stand-alone policy on paid parental leave.

Effective Date
The policy provides paid leave benefits in connection with the birth, adoption, or placement in foster care of a child occurring on or after January 1, 2017. 

Eligibility
An Eligible Employee is any regular, full-time Greentown Labs employee with at least one year (365 days) of continuous service to Greentown Labs as of the time of the leave is requested to start and who is or will be at that time a “parent,” as defined below.

A Parent is an employee, regardless of gender, who is:
* The biological parent of a newborn child who will retain parental rights to that newborn child;
* A spouse or domestic partner of the biological parent who will retain parental rights to that newborn child; or
* An adoptive or foster parent.

Paid Parental Leave Specifies
Greentown Labs will provide up to sixteen (16) weeks of paid parental leave to an Eligible Employee following the birth, adoption or foster placement of a child. Paid parental leave does not reduce an Eligible Employee’s balance of any other paid leave provided by Greentown Labs. In other words, it does not draw from vacation, holidays, sick time or bereavement or any other Greentown Labs paid leave programs. 
B4665602.2

As reflected in the below chart, the length of paid parental leave available to an Eligible Employee depends upon his/her Years of Service at the time his/her leave is requested to start and whether he/she is the “Primary Caregiver” or “Non-Primary Caregiver,” as defined below.

The Primary Caregiver is the Parent who primarily cares for the child following the child’s birth, adoption or foster placement. 

The Non-Primary Caregiver is the Parent who does not have primary caregiving responsibility for the child following the child’s birth, adoption or foster placement.

Timing of Leave and Type of Leave
To minimize disruption to business operations, as a Primary Caregiver, an Eligible Employee must take paid leave during the first sixteen (16) weeks following the event of a birth, adoption or foster care placement of the child. If taking advantage of Paid Parental Leave as a Non-Primary Caregiver, an eligible employee may take this leave any time within the first twenty-six (26) weeks following the event of a birth, adoption or foster care placement of the child. Leave must be taken consecutively, unless approved by the Eligible Employee’s manager and Greentown Labs’ Director of Operations in writing. An Eligible Employee is permitted to determine how many weeks - up to the maximum number of weeks provided by this Policy - to take.

An Eligible Employee is limited to the applicable maximum Primary Caregiver weeks of paid leave under this policy as reflected in the chart above. The leave can be taken as a Primary Caregiver Only, Non-Primary Caregiver Only, or in part as a Primary Caregiver, and, in part, as a Non-Primary Caregiver. For example, an employee with more than two Years of Service, may take 10 weeks as a Primary Caregiver and 2 weeks as a Non Primary Caregiver. Such employee’s maximum paid time off is 12 weeks total.

Job Protection
An Eligible Employee under the Paid Parental Leave Policy will be reinstated to his or her previous position or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions, subject to the following exception. An employee who takes leave has no greater right to reinstatement than if the employee has continued working. For example, if the employee’s position would have been eliminated had he/she not gone on leave, then he/she would not be entitled to reinstatement.

If an Eligible Employee takes leave that is beyond the time provided under this Paid Parental Leave Policy pursuant to another applicable leave policy, only the job protection provisions, if any, of the other applicable leave policy will apply once the paid parental leave is exhausted.

Concurrent Leave
To the extent permitted by law, paid parental leave will run concurrently with any unpaid leave provided by law or Greentown Labs policy that is triggered by the circumstances underlying any paid parental leave.

Amount of Pay During Paid Parental Leave
An Eligible Employee can choose between two options for receiving paid parental leave. The options are outlined in the table on page two. For an employee with over 2 years of service, the choice is between 16 weeks of 70% base pay or 12 weeks of 100% base pay. All other requirements outlined in this policy apply.

The amount that Greentown Labs will pay under this policy will be the Eligible Employee’s “Regular Weekly Base Pay,” as defined below, less any other wage replacement income or state -or federal- provided benefits he/she is eligible to receive. In order to ensure receipt of the equivalent of 100% of Regular Weekly Base Pay, an Eligible Employee must apply for any other available wage replacement income, such as Greentown Labs sponsored disability benefits or state or federal benefits he/she may be eligible to receive (e.g., income from a state disability plan or a state paid family leave program).

Regular Weekly Base Pay is either: (a) a non-exempt Eligible Employee’s base hourly rate of pay multiplied but the number of straight time hours the Eligible Employee is normally scheduled to work in a workweek; (b) an exempt Eligible Employee’s base weekly salary; or (c) a nonexempt salaried Eligible Employee’s base weekly salary. Regular base pay does not include items such as bonus, incentive pay, shift differential pay, and commissions.

Benefits Continuation
Greentown Labs will continue to pay its share of the cost benefits elected by the Eligible Employee during a paid parental leave. The Eligible Employee’s share of the premium will be deducted from the employee’s pay in accordance with the normal practice. Continued benefit coverage is subject to timely completion of all election forms and premium payment.

Requesting Leave
Please follow the steps outlined below to request paid parental leave:
1. An Eligible Employee is required to inform his/her manager as soon as possible of his/her intent to take Paid Parental Leave and his/her anticipated leave dates. At a minimum, an Eligible Employee typically is required to provide his/her manager with at least three-months advance notice of his/her intention to take Paid Parental Leave. Greentown Labs understands that certain extraordinary circumstances dictate shorter advance notification and will consider such situations on a case-by-case basis.
2. Additionally, he/she is responsible for contacting the Director of Operations via email at sjackson@greentownlabs.com for guidance on submitting a formal leave request as well as to obtain other important leave-related information.
3. An Eligible Employee is required to let the Director of Operations and his/her manager know as soon as possible of the exact date on which he/she expects to begin his/her leave.
4. An Eligible Employee is required to complete the appropriate primary and/or non primary caregiver attestations, copies of which will be provided by the Director of Operations, as part of the formal leave request.

Disclaimer
The Paid Parental Leave policy is not incorporated into any employment contract and cannot be considered an agreed term or condition of employment. Greentown Labs has the right to amend or withdraw this policy at any time, with or without advance notice.
