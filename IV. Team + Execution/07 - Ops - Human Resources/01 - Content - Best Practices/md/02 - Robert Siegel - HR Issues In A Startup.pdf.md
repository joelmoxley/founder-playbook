Best Practices

Managing the Technical Function
Make or buy or rent
Can you judge the deliverables?
Throwing away the MVP
Finding a technical co-founder
* And if you’ve never worked together before…


Truisms
All that matters is if the product works and is on time
Hire people who have delivered and shipped product before
Development includes customers, product/market fit, QA, scalability

Best Practices


Paying Your Team
Pay what is fair (cash and stock)
Don’t overpay and don’t underpay
Assume comp is an open book
There are best practices – you don’t need to reinvent the wheel

VPs – 1.5% to 3.0%
Directors – 0.5% to 1%
Managers – 0.2% to 0.4%
All others – < 0.2%

How to Divvy Up the Pie…
Classic startup – founders
*  Not all equal
*  Experience, background, skillsets

Mix of title and position is less of an issue with a founding group
*  Aforementioned variables more important

It’s all about “t-comp”


Holistic POV
Investors
Employee pool
*  It needs to be refreshed after each round if you take venture money
*  You will be diluted; get comfortable with it

Founders
*  What’s left over…
*  You will be diluted; get comfortable with it


Other Special Attributes of Executives
Early exercise
*  Tax benefits
Vesting schedules
*  Accelerated vesting upfront if a founder
*  Acceleration on acquisition (double trigger)


Best Practices
Startups are not democracies
HR from Day 1:
Informal feedback
360 degree reviews
Scott Brady methods


Other Random Insights
Your team is a reflection of you
You never heard anyone say, “I’m glad I kept that person around for an extra six months…”
How the CEO keeps his/her job
If there is a problem with the business, figure it out before your Board does
