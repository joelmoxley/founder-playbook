Healthcare Org Retains Top Talent and Improves Patient Satisfaction
Leadership cracked the code on employee turnover and boosted patient satisfaction
This real world example illustrates how organizations large and small can use data about their employee’s core values to reduce turnover and increase customer satisfaction.

The situation

In 2010, a national healthcare conglomerate came to RoundPegg with two goals:

Reduce employee turnover due to burnout
Provide superior patient care and increased patient satisfaction
Getting to the root of turnover and performance

Executive leadership was convinced that retention and patient satisfaction were related. They believed that solid alignment between the organization’s goals and employee values would increase employee engagement, reduce turnover and ultimately lead to a world class patient experience.

Before they could start their journey on the road to alignment they needed to establish a baseline. They used the RoundPegg Core Values Assessment to establish a culture baseline based on the aggregate values of employees across the organization. For the first time they knew for sure what was most (and least) important to employees. They used this data to reinforce areas of strong alignment and make adjustments to potential misalignments.

culture baseline

The data also made it easy for leadership to identify certain desired values (values not currently present in the organization, but viewed as essential to top performance) they felt might prevent against burn out.  The combination of current core values and desired values gave leadership the data they needed to build a hiring profile that selects candidates who share values with your unique and/or desired culture.

If you read the Steps to Retain Top Talent you’ll remember that retention and performance come down to two things:

Hire candidates with the right skills AND the right culture fit
Tailor management to fit the unique values of your employees.
Immediately the talent acquisition team used this hiring profile to interview and select candidates they knew would fit the culture and be long-term top performers. The values profile also gave leadership a template managers could use to tailor their approach to the unique values of their specific teams.

How it all played out:

To evaluate the success of their work, leadership used engagement surveys to ensure that managers took a tailored approach with their teams. Over the course of one year engagement data reflected an improvement in an employee’s intent to stay, decreased burnout and positive patient care perceptions.

We all like to think we know our company’s culture. As a business leader, you might have even taken steps to define and nurture your company’s culture. There is nothing wrong with intentionally setting out to build the culture you want to work in. Challenging? Fun? Collaborative? Competent? Sounds good to me!

How do you know the rest of your team sees the actual company culture in the way you think or would like it to be? Disconnects happen, and the sooner management knows about them, the sooner they can address the issues and everyone can move on to doing what they enjoy, like helping clients be more successful or collaborating with others on a challenging project.
