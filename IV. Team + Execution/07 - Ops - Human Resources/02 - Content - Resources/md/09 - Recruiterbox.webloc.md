Work at Recruiterbox
Recruiterbox helps growing companies hire simply and predictably. Most recruiting software is so clunky and cumbersome that people often relapse to using email and spreadsheets. Recruiterbox intends to change that. We understand that hiring works best when people collaborate and make informed decisions together. Which is why we designed Recruiterbox to get out of your way and get this job done.

At Recruiterbox, we are not only building a product, but also a company. The people that work here, their styles and values, and the enviroment they work in - all eventually reflect in the product. It makes sense to pay attention to it. Here are few things we believe in:

* Focus on customers and team. The rest will take care of itself.
* Good products don't have more things. They do more things, each really really well.
* Beauty isn't skin deep. Under the hood matters. We care about code.
* Incessantly simplify.
* Work together without bureaucracy and politics. No arm chair generals. Everyone hands-on!

We love Open Source

Recruiterbox has gained immensely from the open source movement, and we intend to give back. Wherever possible, we open source parts of our code that are not specific to our business. Some of our salient projects:
* RIP: RIP (Rest In Peace) is a python framework to provide a RESTful interface to your web application
* Plasticparser: An Elastic Search Query Parser
* RboxFilePlug: A pluggable django app that can be used to manage files across the entire application
* Backbone-nested: A backone.js plugin to handle nested models based on a schema.
* Backbone-Factory: A factory for creating Backbone objects for testing.
