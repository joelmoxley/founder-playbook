The Consultant further acknowledges and agrees that in the event of the termination of this Agreement his experience and capabilities are such that he can obtain a consulting arrangement or employment in business activities which are either (1) of a different or non-competing nature with his activities as a consultant for the Company, or (2) are carried on in a different geographic location; and that the enforcement of a remedy hereunder by way of injunction will not prevent him from earning a reasonable livelihood.

The Consultant further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants contained herein are necessary for the protection of the Company's legitimate business interests and are reasonable in scope and content.


25.	COMPLETE AGREEMENT 

This agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the matters covered herein. No other agreements, representations, warranties or other matters, oral or written, purportedly agreed to or represented by or on behalf of Consultant by any of its employees or agents, or contained in any sales materials or brochures, shall be deemed to bind the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. Company acknowledges that it is entering into this Agreement solely on the basis of the representations contained herein.

27.	ATTORNEY'S FEES 

Should either party hereto, or any heir, personal representative, successor or assign of either party hereto, resort to litigation to enforce this Agreement, the party or parties prevailing in such litigation shall be entitled, in addition to such other relief as may be granted, to recover its or their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in such litigation from the party or parties against whom enforcement was sought.


28.	NONWAIVER 

No failure or neglect of either party hereto in any instance to exercise any right, power or privilege hereunder or under law shall constitute a waiver of any other right, power or privilege or of the same right, power or privilege in any other instance. All waivers by either party hereto must be contained in a written instrument signed by the party to be charged and, in the case of the Company, by an executive officer of the Company or other person duly authorized by the Company.



 
29.	REMEDY FOR BREACH 

The parties hereto agree that, in the event of breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the damage or imminent damage to the value and the goodwill of the Company's business will be inestimable, and that therefore any remedy at law or in damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief against Consultant in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Consultant, in addition to any other relief (including damages and the right of the Company to stop payments hereunder which is hereby granted) available to the Company under this Agreement or under law.


30.	APPLICABLE LAW

Consultant shall comply with all applicable laws in performing Services but shall be held harmless for violation of any governmental procurement regulation to which it may be subject but to which reference is not made in Exhibit A. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the [State/Province] of [STATE/PROVINCE].


31.	SEVERABILITY; ENFORCEMENT 

If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person, place, or circumstance, shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, the remainder of this Agreement and such provisions as applied to other persons, places, and circumstances shall remain in full force and effect. It is the intention of the parties that the covenants contained in Sections 6 and 7 shall be enforced to the greatest extent (but to no greater extent) in time, area, and degree of participation as is permitted by the law of that jurisdiction whose law is found to be applicable to any acts allegedly in breach of these covenants. It being the purpose of this Agreement to govern competition by Consultant anywhere throughout the world, these covenants shall be governed by and construed according to that law (from among those jurisdictions arguably applicable to this Agreement and those in which a breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened) which best gives them effect.


32.	SCOPE OF AGREEMENT 

If the scope of any of the provisions of the Agreement is too broad in any respect whatsoever to permit enforcement to its full extent, then such provisions shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the parties hereto consent and agree that such scope may be judicially modified accordingly and that the whole of such provisions of this Agreement shall not thereby fail, but that the scope of such provisions shall be curtailed only to the extent necessary to conform to law.


33.	ADDITIONAL WORK 

After receipt of an order which adds to the Services, Consultant may, at its discretion, take reasonable action and expend reasonable amounts of time and money based on such order. Company agrees to pay Consultant for such action and expenditure as set forth in Exhibit B of this Agreement for payments related to Services.


34.	NOTICES 

All notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand or mailed, postage prepaid, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and addressed to the Company at:

			[YOUR COMPANY NAME]
			[YOUR COMPLETE ADDRESS]

			or to the Consultant at:

			[CONSULTANT’S NAME AND ADDRESS]

Notice of change of address shall be effective only when done in accordance with this Section.


35.	ASSIGNMENT 

This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party. Except for the prohibition on assignment contained in the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefits of the heirs, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have signed this Agreement as of the date first above written.
