About Jabil
    

At Jabil, we empower the brands who empower the world – it’s our reason for being and the guiding force that’s driving us to become the most technologically advanced manufacturing solutions provider on the planet.  Whether we’re serving one of the world’s biggest and best known brands or the coolest tech startups, our resolve never wavers. We share common desires with these brands: to make the world a better, safer and cleaner place.

We are privileged to join these brands, our customers, in their quest, because it takes tenacity, ingenuity and passion to thrive in this world of unrelenting change. As the fourth Industrial Revolution looms, change is happening 10 times faster and at 300 times the scale – that’s roughly 3,000 times the impact of the first one. To stay relevant, and deliver growth to stakeholders, brands must work with companies they trust to drive innovation at the speed of digital, be agile enough to move manufacturing workloads quickly in the face of political and policy shifts, leverage technology at a time when technology & engineering resources are scarce, and master the art of supply chain orchestration to ensure a personalized and superior customer experience. That’s no small feat.

As your trusted partner, Jabil has carefully studied the drivers of this change, to best empower you, and found the following: 

Accelerating technological change is permeating every vector of organizational value chains. Disruptions are causing disintermediation and creating new business models, shutting some companies out of their markets completely while opening doors for others. Digital technologies are driving massive transformations. And there is no end in sight. In fact, 60 percent of companies surveyed by McKinsey & Company believe that up to half their income will come from technology-enabled innovation by 2020.

Data analysis is now a science; companies pull data from everyone, everywhere and everything and apply powerful analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to turn that data into useful insights, actions and customer experiences. 

At the same time, consumers devour new technology the second it becomes available at adoption rates never seen, driving consumer expectations to an all-time high.  

Meanwhile, barriers to market entry for emerging competitors are at their lowest point ever.

Technology is changing everything, fast.

Geo-political & economic shifts are causing great uncertainty for OEMs as they strive to understand the impact of Brexit, tax reform, treaties, foreign currency, debt rates, resource scarcity, and climate change as well as other political and policy swings. Additionally, the world’s economies are being rewritten in front of our eyes, as the center of economic gravity shifts. Market watchers, company analysts, supply chain managers and economists are tasked with around-the-clock “what if” scenarios to keep up with each twist and turn.

Explosive demographic shifts add another layer of complexity because of the growing and aging population coupled with rapid urbanization. These two dynamics create mounting pressure on current infrastructure and talent pools, as well as healthcare and energy resources.  These factors are not helped by the ever-widening skills GAP in STEM fields.  All combined, these demographic pressures create a gap between what stakeholders expect and what companies can execute.

Welcome to the Digital Age! It’s a perfect storm of epic proportion.

In weathering this storm, our mission has become clear: To become the world's most technologically advanced manufacturing solutions provider, who cares about people and the planet, and offers you growth empowerment in 4 ways:

Accelerated Innovation Solutions to help you stay relevant in a world of change.
Global Manufacturing Agility Solutions to insulate your business from political and/or policy uncertainty and get you closer to your customers/markets without compromising your bottom line.

Supply Chain Orchestration Solutions to help manage and mitigate risk across your supply chain, uncover opportunities and ultimately deliver superior financial performance and optimum customer experiences.
Jabil delivers all this value to empower you, your brand and customers. We are your force multiplier and stand ready to help you empower the world.
